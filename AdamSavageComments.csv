ENIAC's claim to fame is being the completely electronic part, not first ""fully pprogrammable. All computers are ""fully programmable"" and the fact that they all worked on that computer does not make them the full compliment of programmers. In the case of Lovelace, I don't know enough to say whether there was a time when only she was able to program the thing as clearly Babbage was able to program the thing and someone did so that's a bit weak of an argument and considering we're talking general purpose digital computing to some degree the best you can get out of that is 50/50. But 2 major problem with what you're saying is that you're talking a very small number of people before any of this stuff took off to any degree and ignoring the larger picture of what was going on. The other major problem, at least in the case of Lovelace is that I see no reason to presume she's the programmer... Which I need to clarify and which is the actual problem here. The person who input the program and the person who came up with the program was often not the same person. By today's standard though, it would be. I consider the person who input the program to be nothing more than an input device like any keyboard, equivalent to such in this context and the person who came up with the program is equivalent to the programmer in today's terms and I'd hope that anyone trying to make the claim you're putting forward would be doing the same. That being the case there is no reason to think that I know of to place Lovelace as a programmer. So you have provided 1 invalid entry and 1 that within context not only shows that women weren't the majority, they likely weren't even a very big minority within such a small field otherwise they wouldn't have had to ""self teach"" themselves programming but instead invented it or learned it from someplace other than themselves.",1,is_reply,0

Of course you could make the assumption that because he did not outright disagree with the premise, that he was supporting a premise that ""gamergate was comprised of that behavior"" but closely looking at this I dont see it that way. The closest I saw to him addressing the premise of 'hate', was his reference to Carrie and the kinds of comments she got for being a woman in the tech industry. (I'm assuming it would be the kinds of comments on forums and under youtube videos). This is somebody who is looking at a case through first hand experience and its not even about gaming, its probably closer to the culture of trolling and immaturity on the internet, which is something we can mostly agree is something that the internet could do without. And frankly, as somebody who has been following the movement, and is probably most closely ideologically aligned with TB (On the side that gamers exist, ethics is required, but lets be civil).... I would think most gamergaters would be very pleased with Adam's comments. Firstly, he rightly addresses that its a multi-industry wide problem, not a gamer problem. Indeed, if you wanted to talk about gamers are dead and then segway into ""toxic masculinity"", whatever that is - any intelligent critically thinking person would logically segway into society and culture as a whole, not just gaming. For instance, Hollywood (which he called out specifically), Mass Media (called out specifically), and probably Youtube comments and public discussion (implied through comments Carrie). There is the fact that he went to all this trouble to be diplomatic, despite the question being phrased around ""gaming"", Adam did not mention gaming ONCE, and yet people are posting stuff like ""Respect for adam = lost"". I mean, do you want to actually listen to what somebody says or just hear 1-2 words, close the video, and form a slothful opinion here. If more people could take a step back from hatred and just 'listening and believing' and critically think about what is actually going on, then this problem would be a lot closer to being presently solved than it currently is. Adam is FAR from being a SJW in this video, hes a critically thinking person. Id even go so far as to call his observations in the realm of trying to be scientific (as much as you can call armchair psycho-analyzing science). I'm kind of surprised with some of the comments here. Sadly, from the comment section here. It appears that ""listen and believe"" is not a problem unique to SJW's. Gamergater's can be just as guilty in echo chambers and circlejerks in comment sections.",0,is_reply,0

As far as his comments about what Byron has gone through. As far as I know and have seen she gets trolls just like any one else, but most of the commentary is filled with love, but he implies that she is getting massive amounts of hate and threats and such. The thing is he likely is doing this more than he realizes for the very reason I have a problem with what he's saying. He doesn't know what he's being asked and I really rather doubt that what he thinks happens to Byron is accurate considering how we as humans tend to deal with this stuff. She may get thousands of people saying how great she is and then get 1 ranting about how awful she is and that 1 is more likely what she is going to share and talk about and be effected by and so Adam sees the 1 and not the thousands and the effect that 1 has. So he's likely misrepresenting and answering a question he doesn't with misrepresented information, both of which he takes a stand against doing, but he's doing here.

GamerGate stemmed from reports of Video Game Journalists having lost their ethics with respect to the readership they write for. Having said this, while there have been reports of threats (which everyone I know agrees is abhorrent), the majority of concern stems not from women entering, or working in the video game industry, but the attempt to redefine what games should be played. Video Gamers welcome girls/women to play. The video games industry welcomes girls/women to work. The trends becoming apparent are the attempts to redefine what is acceptable in games. The thought police are out to take your fun! For MANY years, it's been suggested that violence in video games translates to violence in society & this just isn't so! And now we have radical groups entering the industry asserting, ""Video games promote a culture of misogyny against women"" without any evidence to substantiate the claim that they're implying. An analogy I made earlier would be the redefine a First Person Shooter (FPS), so the game characters go for pony rides, then go down to the mall & look for clothes to buy... It is an absurd notion, but this is what's happening - we have groups wanting to redefine what a video game should look like, to make it into something it isn't. Look, bottom line is this; if you want to write a video game that appeals to girls/women, then write it... Everyone will rejoice!

I'm supportive of GamerGate and I'm not a misogynist. In my opinion, the women who've received negative comments are the victims of their own public conduct and not misogyny, and here's why: Sarkeesian has been caught lying multiple times (see Thunderf00t) and recently blamed a school shooting on ""toxic masculinity"". Isn't that sexist? I'm not condoning threats against her, but maybe the negative attention she's receiving has more to do with her behaviour rather than her gender... Also, Brianna Wu implied that the recent 4chan killer's behaviour was indicative of GG supporters, even though he never mentioned the movement so far as we know. Additionally, GG discussions were moved to 8chan long before the killing because 4chan was deleting all related threads, and Brianna Wu knows this (she said so on MSNBC). In light of this, her accusations appear inconsistent and perhaps dishonest. Lastly, the negative attention directed at Samantha Allen has been used (mostly by Wu) as an example of misogyny in gaming. However, Allen wrote a lengthy Tumblr post about why she hates men; she publicly revels in her misandry. Yet I haven't seen a single news outlet bring this up when discussing the supposed misogyny in gaming. All things considered, it seems to me that these women are receiving hate because of their own sexist actions, not because of misogyny.

These new leftists are basically hypocrites of the highest order, they spit in the face of every progressive ideal that exists. From freedom of speech which they attacked when they enacted a campaign of mass suppression, banning and deleting on any site they could manage to get to, tens of thousands of comments were deleted sight unseen on reddit even, even 4chan was lost, moot apparently is brainwashed by sjw's and has a gf who works PR for gawker now. To dishonesty in journalism when they just put out article after article for 2 + months, even when they knew they were wrong they were putting out gamers is dead articles weeks after people rebutted all their nonsense from the previous rounds. All the ideals of the past or what you imagined journalists had when you watched the Newsroom, all proven mythical by these people, they didn't even try to hold by the principles. They had a secret mailing list which was exposed, where they colluded to create a narrative, thus publishing 10 gamers are dead articles in a day. They then concocted the stop the hate petition which people were supposed to think was a natural response from developers, but in fact the media created it themselves to report on. Its really disturbing behavior. Then they enacted blacklists, basically the ""blockbot"" which was a way of silencing all dissent even on their social media, they put the blinders on to shield their conscience. This blockbot is from the atheism plus era, when the first invasion of the sjw's occurred. Mykerumedia covers this in his videos, as does thunderf00t. Its the most insideous and anti progressive type of thing they could have created, its an enemies list they created where most anything can get you on there. Dare to disagree, or someone just doesn't like you, you go on the list of people to be blocked. Like a mccarthyite communist list this was an enemies list, a black list that people just mindlessly subscribed to in order to further conform. Just more evidence of how sheep like and cult like these peoples thinking had become. They they turned to hate mongering. All the techniques of Goebbels in action. Repeat a smear ad infinitum until it is assumed. I'm sure some black person robbed a liquor store some where in america, thus proving all black people are potential criminals, thus this justifies my prejudice against them, and this was their reasoning. And they pushed it hard. It was an endless PR campaign of articles and appearances just repeating the statements about misogyny based on no credible evidence. Attributing a random persons supposed harassment as gamergate is no better than smearing all black people as criminals because somewhere out there I'm sure one of them did a crime.... It was hate mongering 101, it was perpetuating hate and prejudice. And for people who claim to be sensitive to issues of bigotry and prejudice, it was hypocrisy on a scale which was hard to stomach. And oh the hypocrisy, on our side they point to some random people who made some ugly comments or harassment, no attributable to gamergate as one can't prove these people are even on our side to begin with. All the leading figures of gamergate have behaved in the most civil manner possible, especially considering the pressure they were under, the torrent of hate from the media, the fact that they were going against media professionals, the gamergate members kept their cool and did not act as the anti gamergaters claimed. All the while on the other side, you had hypocrisy on a massive scale. These anti gamergate people, these sjw's are guilty of projection. You had grown professional people behaving as children on the anti gamergate side, gawkers writer sam biddle called for bullying of nerds on twitter, jezebels editor did the same. People like Ben Dreyfuss of Mother Jones said horrible things on twitter, and the list just goes on and on, people like eventstatus on youtube have cataloged quite a few in his videos. You watched these adults in media with power behave far worse than anything they were pointing fingers over, it was disturbing. And so these people flooded flooded the media space with endless articles on misogyny, thus poisoning the discussion as they intended, which in turn poisoned wikipedia as they are the citation sources, which in turn poisoned the regular media outlets who either through incompetence or malice just sourced their information from these corrupt people once again. And they've been doing this for over 2 months now. This is the new corruption of the left, where they've proven that the leftist media can in fact be worse than fox news. They've proven that it wasn't the religious right or politicians who could damage freedom of speech on the internet, it was the left. They damaged it on reddit, and even 4chan fell. Its really disturbing stuff. And really its happened before at least twice already, occupy wallstreet fell to these people as they turned that movement into a witch hunt for ""misogynists"" and competed with themselves to see who could be the greatest victim. And in atheism conferences where they managed to go even further with claims of threats, even managing to claim assaults.

So should the people that use their position of power to give favors to their friends. The fact that the publications reinstate these positions by not firing the people but outright denying what has happened, and instead keep slandering their consumer base, is what leads to advertising boycotts.

Anita boils down to making pretty much opinionated arguments without any valid research, statistics or otherwise to back up her statements. She demonizes a gaming medium and those who partake in it as patriarchal pigs who hate women no matter what, who want games to be ""sexist"" forever. He calls games like GTA sexist for allowing you to kill women even though you can do the same to men, She calls games like Hitman sexist for allowing you to kill random hookers even thought he game penalizes you for it, She calls princesses like Zelda and Peach bad role models for their damsel position without taking into account that their characters and position in the stories matter more than said position, etc. Not to mention outside of her videos she has said stupid shit like men are responsible for the majority of mass shootings and that video games are a major factor in the sexism in society. Anita doesn't seem to realize that most of her anger at these tropes isn't, or shouldn't be that they are sexist, but that they are clichd and overdone to death. Also, no one here with a fucking brain is saying that the death threats sent to Anita are justifiable at all. That being said, if Anita is so above all the criticism and simply views gamers or the majority of gamers as basement dwelling shitlords, why is she so threatened by the criticism of her. That's why we are pissed. She wants to promote bullshit straw feminist agendas in gaming by force and cowards when she gets called out on it.

She doesn't call games like Hitman or GTA sexist, she points out (quite resonably) that there are sexist elements in those games. The use of the ""damsel"" trope is criticized as lazy storytelling and it is precisely because their whole position in the story is little more than a ""McGuffin"" that reflects that laziness. She does not demonize the whole gaming community, she simply points out that these sexist elements exist and are objectionable to a pretty big part of the gaming community. It's true that men are responsible for most mass shootings, but Sarkeesian does not blame video games for causing violence; she points out that they reflect the same kind of thinking that contributes to that violence. This is nothing at all like Jack Thomson's argument. It's apparent that you're allowing T-Foot to do your thinking for you when you start repeating the same ill-informed nonsense. that he's spouting.

Yes, the damsel trope is old and tired and of course offensive to some regard, but if you want people to stop expressing apparently offensive tropes in gaming media, then you need to have some form of discussion. Instead, Anita is more than willing to ignore criticism, no matter how valid, and what I have seen from her twitter, she even dismiss much criticism of her as nothing more that misogyny and trolling.

The issue is that the gamergate movement is silenced in all fronts of the discussion, such as news outlets only focusing on one side, while the other is mocked and bullied. I don't care if you view the movement as flawed, evil or whatever, but what I do find annoying is that people like you are completely oblivious to the legit voice and critique coming out of people in the movement, as well as the obvious yellow journalistic opinion pieces being strung in the news to twist the narrative away from the movements original goal. The people against Gamergate do not want to debate about any of the topics brought up from what I've seen. Instead they want to silence the movement as all misogynist cis white male shitlord-sockpuppet-whatever-the-fucks in order to direct legitimacy to their victimhood through the trolling they have received, and as a result gain protecting from the media outlets. If they hold their views on political correctness and feminist theory to be the ultimate good or whatever, why are they so afraid to have it challenged. Nonetheless, neutrality is key here. Seeing as the media has done everything in its power to direct the focus for one side and against the other, and focus on the harassments of people who clearly have been using said harassment to further their agenda as well get more attention, all that this has proven is that the media sure as hell will go a long way to direct people away from criticism of themselves. Also, looking through most of your links, I can only direct you to my statement on how no one is the voice for the whole movement. It doesn't excuse the bullshit many on the pro GG side can and have said, but it doesn't distract from the movements goals and achievements, nor make the anti side as the legitimist. Leaderlessness may be GGs biggest flaw, but it is also its greatest weapon, to a degree. PS: I'm not a GGer, only a spectator ;)",4,is_reply,0

It is idiotic, to put it mildly. Claim 1: SJWs in gaming journalism can ruin games hahano. Controversy surrounding something like GTA or Hatred can actually increase sales. Claim 2: game reviews should be objective Reviews are inherently subjective. Critique is inherently subjective. >Claim 2.a: keep your politics out of game reviews Like it or not, games are art, and politics is often a useful point from which to critique art. You wouldn't expect someone to talk about Robocop (the original one that is, the new one had different political subtext) without bringing up Ronald Reagan, and likewise it is patently absurd to expect someone to talk about Bioshock without bringing up objectivism. >Claim 2.b: At least keep your personal views on politics out of game reviews Why? If the political views expressed by a game harm my enjoyment of that game, than I see no reason why I should not be allowed to state as such in a review. For example, look no further than Ethnic Cleansing, a game about exactly what it says on the tin. While it is technically flawed (to put it mildly), the shitty models and unfun gameplay are dwarfed by the fact that the game is quite literally Nazi propaganda, and I feel the fact that the game's politics quite literally disgust me is far more important than how many polygons the weapon models have. >Claim 2.c: Your opinions on politics are subjective! Your readers might not share it! So what? My opinions on video games are subjective too. I think Human Revolution is both a better shooter and a better RPG than the original Deus Ex. I think that Baldur's Gate is overrated and Icewind Dale is quite possibly the worst game I've played since ET for the Atari 2600. You don't share my opinions?

I have no problem with games being considered art, but there is a subset who believes that games must always be presented in an artistic way.

The thing is, I'm actually relatively neutral on this point. I think that ""dumb"" entertainment games such as CoD or GTA have a place in the medium, as well as the art games like Gone Home. I mean, I don't think as a game Gone Home has much to offer and is nothing but a ""walking simulator"", but on the other hand I think The Stanley Parable is brilliant, and it isn't much different.

I also dislike censorship. That's one thing I very much dislike about the GGers I usually talk to: they think critiquing something and trying to censor that thing are the same. Saying ""I don't like x,"" ""I think x is offensive,"" or the occasional ""I think x could offend someone"" is not the same as saying ""I think people should not be allowed to sell x."" Furthermore, ""I dislike or am offended by y element in x"" is often confused with ""I dislike x,"" even though the two are very different. I think the way Metro: Last Light handled Anya was both badly written and sexist, but I will definitely recommend that game to anyone looking for a first person shooter about Russian hobos. Likewise, I think Planescape Torment's combat is slightly less fun than being crucified, and that its use of fanservice is both juvenile and nonsensical (as a venn diagram of people who are willing to buy a game based solely on the fact it contains tits and people who will enjoy Planescape Torment consists of two circles that do not intersect at any point), but I consider it to be the best game I have ever played.",0,is_reply,0

This argument is one of the reasons why Gone Home was so critically panned by audiences. on one hand, it has a fairly well rounded narrative. On the other however, it is completely devoid of any gameplay other that walking and picking up objects, lacks replay value and is incredibly short in length, not to mention it cost more than 10 bucks on Steam.

Anita Sarkessian doesn't have anywhere near the popular support she thought she did. Despite almost universal support from the mainline media and now a lot of spare cash 2. The fact that Anita doesn't have popular support like she thought she had means that anytime she steps out of the echo chamber she's going to get creamed. And the nice thing is that in order to win she HAS TO step out of the echo chamber I do have to point out that she does have a deep source of money from Intel that though only helps her and the AntiGGers to a limited extent. They don't have the numbers so in order to balance this out she'll have to bring in hired guns to bolster her support. Thing is that Sam Biddle already tried this a couple of months back and it didn't work then either and it didn't work because (and excuse the lists again 1. These hired guns don't have an emotional investment in the issue 2. They don't know the issue well at all and are easy to spot 3. They're going up against people that have been battle hardened by constant fights on 8chan, Twitter, YouTube, Facebook etc. Some of whom have been doing this via the MRM for a couple of years now. 4. Intel will DEMAND a return on their investment. So as badly as she got licked she HAS to come out and do it all again soon. This is far from over but be on the lookout for decoys and sock puppets from AntiGG and expect a lot more hackings. But the Nightline piece was a HUGE win for GamerGate. There were people ready to throw in the towel when Anita got all that money from Intel. Brianna Wu was even so arrogant as to declare victory, Feminists came out and openly wrote hit pieces that were not even remotely honest. But well we all know how that went Ultimately though we made Anita cry finally, she cannot win unless she controls all the factors and she cannot win unless she lets go.

No amount of denial from you will change that and again prove me wrong Sam Biddle did try bring in hired guns a couple months back got caught and it had next to no impact on what happened. In spite of yet another campaign by the AntiGG that was curiously timed to happen right after Brianna Wu declared that she got threatened. 1144 Likes proves you don't have the numbers because if they did they would've gone over by now and attempted to rectify the balance. Even with brigading and sock puppets there's nothing stopping you from going over and doing the exact same thing and it hasn't happened Now if that doesn't say you don't have the numbers I don't know what will so nice try. As for the second part... Hired guns are just not as committed proven historical fact that is. So yeah you can try to dismiss this all you want but WE WON there period.

Explain what's wrong with what Karen Straughan says in reality, go watch a video and then explain why she would be in a hate group. The only actual hate group here is feminism. When a group spends its time spreading misinformation to create prejudice, its a hate group. No different than if a white skin head group went around just throwing out a 1 in 4 black men rape women stat, no matter what counter evidence was thrown in their face, their motivations for creating prejudice would be clear. And that is exactly what feminists do, but they target all men. So hate group? Feminism fits at this point, its just an ugly fact of modern reality. The mra's? Go watch some videos from studio brule, bane666au, razorbladekandy, and even paul elams channel, and explain the ""hate"".

Its no surprise he runs in their circles and holds the same views. The hugbox which shelters people from rational criticism is very attractive to people who have problems. You only have to look at breitbarts recently expose of Shanley Kane, this is a new breed of hypocrite who hides behind the banner of feminism or social justice so they can find, dehumanize and bully people with wild abandon.

Just like every other motherfucker that's got a working brain. You can't have it three ways. Either games are mindless entertainment or they're art. Or they're both at the same time. That's up to the individual to decide for themselves. HOWEVER - for anyone who insists that games should be looked at as a legitimate storytelling medium with a lot of promise (like I do), then you should have the intestinal fortitude to accept criticism of it, too. I've been playing video games of all sorts since I was fucking 5 years old. I'm a woman. Video games - everything from the devs to the studios to the distributors to the community and the culture - have a serious problem with women. As a 30+ year gamer, I'm saying that. Isn't that enough? It's not being a victim or looking for 'special' anything -- it's looking at something and saying 'huh... this is fucked up'. There's absolutely nothing wrong with saying that. It doesn't make someone evil, or corrupt, or a liar, or a manipulator or any of the other ridiculous monkey shit insults and slander people are throwing around when it comes to Anita. Everybody - in some way, to some extent - plays games, now. Am I pissed about that? Am I grousing about the damn derty casuals? No. Because it's *none of my fucking business* what people do or how they do it or why. I do my thing. I buy the kinds of games that I like, the kinds of games that interest me - and I play them and I have fun and get wowed by the marriage of the ingenuity of modern technological advancements and creativity that they represent. Do I wanna play Call of Dookie and Battlefart? Fuck, no. Luckily for me, there are alternatives out there - I just want MORE of them - I have the right, as a member of the consumer group, to demand that the market give me more of what I want. Especially if they want me to fork over $40-$60 at a time for a single fucking game. The kind of games you play doesn't concern me. Get it? It's not about what you want. It's about what I - as a consumer - want. And doesn't GamerGate claim to be a consumer advocacy group? Oh, but I forgot - I don't have a dick, so my wants as a consumer don't matter, right? I don't give a fuck what you play, so long as studios stop being afraid to create video games with protagonists that have one less fucking penis once in a blue goddamn moon. What Anita talks about - and what I do whole-heartedly agree with - is that the way that the majority of video games these days portray/treat/represent women is fucking bullshit. And I think the way that women are treated in the gaming industry is also bullshit. Anita's not calling for the end of violent video games or sexist video games or any of your favey-faves. All she's saying is 'so I noticed this stuff - it's fucked up - if you feel like doing something about it, you can if you wanna'. Will some studios and devs and distributors listen? Sure. Some already have. And it got us games like The Last of Us, which - imo - was a pretty fucking awesome game. Video games as we know them aren't over or dead because developers and studios are listening to her or anybody else who has something to say about how video games treat women. A lot of studios and devs and distributors probably also won't listen and that's fine, too - but the market will have the final say, and with more women buying and playing games than ever before, there's gonna come a time where they *have* to listen, otherwise they risk losing out on a huge source of revenue. The time will come where they have to acknowledge us, because it's what good, shiny capitalists do - they chase the money. Time to grow up and learn that not everything is about you. Either learn to share like a civilized human being or get the fuck out.",5,is_reply,0

Yeah, and this is all really about ethics in game journalism. Shuuuuree. ""If you have legitimate criticism and do not resort to out of context representation or cherry picking to voice your critisism, have fun at doing it."" What you refer to as 'cherry-picking' is what most people would call an example. It is just one from that game franchise, but that's the point - she doesn't have all the time in the world to talk about every single fucking instance of women being treated like shit in video games. She used one example, but there are plenty more out there where that came from. The devs put scantily clad women in these players' ways and allow them to be interacted with. That's basically 'she was asking for it', in video game terms. ""But if you come from the out side with an agenda, cherry pick your evidence, con 160k$ and refuse to engage in or even block any form of debate about your shitty argumentation and fallacious reasoning. THEN we have a problem."" Sorry, but Anita didn't con anybody. She said she wanted to do a series of videos, she got a shit-ton of hate for it and people donated to show their support for her after seeing the endless torrents of abuse and threats she had to put up with. I don't know if anybody in your life has ever told you this, but you do NOT get to decide whose concerns and ideas are valid. You just can't stand the fact that people actually wanted to hear what she had to say - and you don't want people to hear what she has to say because you know there's more truth to what she's saying than you would ever dare to admit. Also, please quit parroting Thunderf00t's accusations. He's a fucking dunderhead who has never even played games before. He's attacking Anita because he has a butthurt axe to grind against feminism because he was a fucking moron and decided to write a blog and post it to a site run by feminist-leaning atheists and they rightfully gave him the fucking boot. The gist of the post was he didn't see the point of having anti-harassment policies at atheist conferences because it 'spoils people's fun'. Nevermind the fact that countless women have been groped, harassed, assaulted and even outright raped at these things. Nah, it would spoil the 'fun'. Yeah, no - he's a fucking rape apologist, as far as I'm concerned, and unless you drop the 'cherry picking and shitty arguments' nonsense, this conversation will come to a stop poste-hasty. ""Critique is fine, denying any form of critisism about your methods and conclusion"" As someone else has already wisely pointed out - she doesn't have to listen to or accept your critcism. This is not some peer-reviewed scientific study. This is a view of this particular media by a single person. She doesn't have to stand there, hold her arms out, and let you throw tomatoes at her for daring to open her mouth while being in possession of a vagina while also simultaneously being on the internet. ""or even go full retard as to call it harassment, THAT is what people like me hate about people like sarkeesian,"" I don't know what planet you're from, but in America? Death threats = harassment. But if you don't believe me, go say some of the shit that people were saying to Anita to the President and see how totes not serious it is. ""160k for 5 videos in 2 year"" She asked for significantly less money. Thanks to 4chan's harassment campaign, she got more money. She actually produced the videos she said she would produce with that money. Again - where does the 'con' part come in? ""with stolen gameplay footage"" I know male reviewers that have used other people's gameplay footage without crediting it. The reaction from the audience wouldn't even register on a heartbeat monitor, it was such a non-issue. So yeah - I call bullshit on your pearl-clutching here. Oh, and btw? Fair use. Look that shit up. ""and just outright false claims about the games?"" If there's incorrect information, then maybe... oh, I don't know - tweet her and politely ask for a correction or an errata update via video notation? Again - don't know who taught you your fucking earth manners, but death and rape threats are no way to get anyone to listen to anything you have to say. ""Woohoo that what I call rigorous research."" Again - it doesn't have to be 'rigorous'. She's not doing a field study of the poo-flinging neckbeard in his natural habitat, here. She's giving her meta commentary about a form of media that has extremely problematic elements to it. As that old Buffy quotation goes: Giles: Yes, let's not jump to any conclusions. Buffy: I didn't jump. I took a tiny step, and there conclusions were. You lot are nit-picking the finer details because you know she's got it bang-on accurate when it comes to the big picture and, again, you guys can't stand that. So, you nitpick, 'cause you don't have anything else. ""Stop claiming that women have it so bad in games."" Stop claiming that women don't have it so bad in video games. Again - what motherfucking planet are you from? THREE WOMEN have been chased out of their homes as a result of death and rape threats. That? Is the very fucking definition of 'women having it bad in video games'. ""What about the men, I could say."" ""What about fuck you,"" is what I'd say back. ""Men are portrait as the most fucking manly man you'll ever see. Is that reality? No."" Oh, poor yous! Getting portrayed as strong and capable and brave and able to protect yourselves valiantly against all threats, terrestrial and otherwise. You got it hard, man. You want a hug? Here's a card for a trauma counsellor I know. ""Do men get killed,hurt, ..etc in games more than women? Yes."" Considering the fact that most games can't/won't include female characters unless there's serious jiggle physics/eye candy involved, there's no real substance to this bit. It's like arguing 'bawww, men die more in wars!', when meanwhile, the military refused to let women do equivalent service because sexism. Try again. ""Have there always been females protagonists in games, yes (FemShep in ME is my fav for instance). But I guess they do not count since Anita says they're all just guys with boobs..."" I've played ME1 and I didn't mind Fem!Shep, but it's like saying Chell is a really stunning example of a great female character in a video game. She's faceless and voiceless - just a body in an ugly orange jumpsuit and super jumpy boots, with a portal gun stuck on the end of her hand. The devs could have easily exchanged Chell for Charles and the players wouldn't have given a toss. It would have been just one more shiny gem on their huge mountain of gold they don't fucking appreciate. ""More and more women play games, but ask yourself what are those games they play."" I don't know about the women they surveyed, but I play all sorts of stuff. ""the study that says 47 or 48% of women play, took people into account that just play browser or smartphone games like candy crush"" Actually, no - it said that 44% of gamers (didn't specify a particular gender) play mobile games and other 'casual' titles. ""you can all it games if you will, but thats really broadening the term 'gamer' to some ridiculous extend,"" If you go by TotalBiscuit's definition of 'game' - an interactive experience that has a set failure condition and/or a set success condition - then yeah, Candy Crush and Farmville and Zuma and all the other titles like that are, in fact, games. Casual they might be, but they're still games. Also, you don't get to decide who or what constitutes a 'gamer', btw.

It's because the media turns it into a harassment campaign - and why wouldn't they? It's a movement finding dirt on the media and calling them out. I don't agree that the harassment portrayed in the media in any way link GamerGate - we're just a very convenient diversion from the real issue. Calling anyone a misogynist neckbeard harasser automatically delegitimises their argument, which is why it's so easy to discredit GamerGate baselessly. If you actually looked, the majority of GamerGate does talk about ethics. And emails. Collusion. And so forth. Nathan gets shit because he talks like an idiot. He gets shit because he baselessly claims a lot of unsubstantiated bollocks, and no one cares about Zoe. Do you want to know who brings her up? The opposition. People like Lifschitz, Chu and Grayson bring her up to no end. We literally do not care about her, Anita or Wu, because they aren't journalists. They make it about themselves and hide behind their gender, when it in fact, is because they are horrible people. On your next post, you say the opposition receives a ton of harassment from GamerGate, but I don't see any evidence of this anywhere. People get called assholes on both sides when they act like assholes, that's not harassment. And yes, we mostly get disagreement, sarcasm and insults. But we get a ton of harassment and threats, both professionally and personally. And this is linked to GamerGate because it is mentioned. People have gotten fired for supporting GamerGate - not for doing anything wrong, but for supporting GamerGate. Called at home, GGFem was threatened with death, KoP was sent a knife and a fire truck, Nero a syringe, and I could go on. On the other hand, evidence that links GamerGate to any form of harassment is hard to come by. And even if a person from GamerGate were to harass or threaten anyone, does that mean the rest 30k is to blame for this? No, of course not, that would be ridiculous.

The only reason I even know his name is because of his involvement with Zoe Quinn, which was decried by - guess who - GamerGate. So GG brought him into this, nobody else.

I understand that it's not nice to hear that your side is committing harassment (not to mention crimes - death threats are a criminal matter after all), but pretending that Anita Sarkeesian, Brianna Wu or Zoe Quinn (and a whole bunch of others) have not really gotten threatened or harassed is willfully ignorant at best, and downright dishonest at worst.

Somehow, to many people this translates to 'OMG, they want to censor our games!'. Sadly, if after you've looked at the twitter streams and 8chan and the many many other places that GGers congregate you still don't think GG is primarily toxic, there's not much I can do. We will have to disagree, because I find many of their methods and actions absolutely reprehensible.

If you think this is just a trivial matter over ""misogyny"" ask yourself the simple question. Is this generation of young people the most intolerant people around? Is that really believable. By all measures this generation is the most progressive that has ever been around in the west. Yet you hear this droning message of ""misogyny"" based on the most dubious evidence possible. So ask yourself is there a credibility gap here. Why are so many women and minorities behind gamergate if the narrative is true. Ask yourself that. Just head on over to Oliver Campbell's channel for instance on youtube, go look at episode 4, he discusses gamergate with several supporters and a dev, one is gay, one is a transsexual, one is a woman, and he is black. Please try to square that circle... Something is wrong in the media, this is the truth of the matter. The games media was exposed to have a secret mailing list where they not only colluded to create a narrative, which led to the 10 gamers is dead articles dropping on the same day, but they will even stoop to making the news they want to report on through the mailing list. The ""stop the hate"" campaign petition which they pretended was an organic response by devs to early gamergate was actually created by those in that mailing list. That is serious corruption, and serious dishonesty and a professional breach of every kind when it comes to their job of reporting the truth and serving their readers. But since these media outlets in gaming work together in unison instead of being competitors, they were able to rig the narrative with and endless torrent of articles, which in turn corrupts wikipedia because they are the ""sources""...which in turn corrupts the mainstream media because these people have connections and are either directly reprinted or become the sources for stories in mainstream media. The standard ""tech"" reporter at a mainstream media publication thinks that ""research"" is reading an article on kotaku, then the verge, and perhaps polygon. Basically at that point anything that person writes is fruit from a poisoned tree. And this has gone on for over 2 months now. I'm sorry but if you dig even for a little bit you will see how far down this rabbit hole goes.

I'm sure some black person out there has murdered someone. By national crime statistics they commit half the murders and about 40 occur each day so that's 20 murders by black people a day. So if we're going to say gamers are misogynists, clearly you should be calling black people criminals and murderers right, that is sjw reasoning in action. The fact is you can't attribute any of the harassment claims to any legitimate gamergate people, in fact the prominent members have behaved admirably under this level of attack. All the while people on the anti gamergate side, adult professionals from sam biddle, who called for nerds to be bulled, and jezebels editor who said much the same, to devin faraci who called us worse than isis, to ben dreyfuss of motherjones who said all sorts of horrific things, and arthur chu who again just spewed all sorts of nonsense....the bad behavior of actual people in power with voices on the anti gamergate side has been FAR worse than anything gamergate has done. In fact just on the matter of harassment and attacks, gamergate has faced doxing of all its major members. King of pol was sent a knife in the mail, milo a syringe, pol got swatted last week as well, and others have had their workplaces called with people making horrific slanderous claims about them being into child pornography trying to get them fired. Of course none of this is reported, and ask yourself why. Again, go look at oliver campbells stream, episode 4 where he has on the most diverse panel around, and ask yourself how you can square that circle with what has been reported.

There has been a degeneration of principles on the progressive left which has allowed this happen, and its been exposed to a generation of people, its been exposed to gamers, and whether you want to acknowledge it or not this will have knock on effects into the future.

For instance, there's this guy sampling the first 100 tweets about GamerGate everyday and putting it into pictures, here's the last one I checked: http://i.imgur.com/XLcvRva.jpg We also had this guy classifying GG tweets between ""anti"" and ""pro"", but he stopped after a while since the results were always 90%+ pro every single day.
