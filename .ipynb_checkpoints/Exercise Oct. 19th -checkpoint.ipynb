       "[\"The nice thing the real nice thing about that Nightline piece was that it was the first major mistake that Anita made and it exposed how weak they actually are in 2 ways 1. Anita Sarkessian doesn't have anywhere near the popular support she thought she did. Despite almost universal support from the mainline media and now a lot of spare cash 2. The fact that Anita doesn't have popular support like she thought she had means that anytime she steps out of the echo chamber she's going to get creamed. And the nice thing is that in order to win she HAS TO step out of the echo chamber I do have to point out that she does have a deep source of money from Intel that though only helps her and the AntiGGers to a limited extent. They don't have the numbers so in order to balance this out she'll have to bring in hired guns to bolster her support. Thing is that Sam Biddle already tried this a couple of months back and it didn't work then either and it didn't work because (and excuse the lists again 1. These hired guns don't have an emotional investment in the issue 2. They don't know the issue well at all and are easy to spot 3. They're going up against people that have been battle hardened by constant fights on 8chan, Twitter, YouTube, Facebook etc. Some of whom have been doing this via the MRM for a couple of years now. 4. Intel will DEMAND a return on their investment. So as badly as she got licked she HAS to come out and do it all again soon. This is far from over but be on the lookout for decoys and sock puppets from AntiGG and expect a lot more hackings. But the Nightline piece was a HUGE win for GamerGate. There were people ready to throw in the towel when Anita got all that money from Intel. Brianna Wu was even so arrogant as to declare victory, Feminists came out and openly wrote hit pieces that were not even remotely honest. But well we all know how that went Ultimately though we made Anita cry finally, she cannot win unless she controls all the factors and she cannot win unless she lets go. So in effect she's screwed herself over\"]"
