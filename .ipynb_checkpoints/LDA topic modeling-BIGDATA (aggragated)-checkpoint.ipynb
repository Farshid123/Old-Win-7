       " 'I always saw the sign along the highway but never stopped, thinking it was just another waterfall. When I finally stopped to see it I was amazed at how rugged and powerful it truly is. Don’t miss this glorious wonder of nature.',\n",
       " \"I very pleasant spot and one that doesn't require much effort to visit.\\nIf you are into photography you might want to time your visit to catch the best light, early morning will mean that you are shooting into the sun.\",\n",
       " \"Can't see much of the fall, and it's kind of small. Also, slipped on the ice and bruised my left elbow, so be careful. Viewpoint was limited.\",\n",
       " 'The Athabasca Falls are just breathtaking in winter!\\nThere is parking just a few hundred meters away so it is safe to go there even when it’s snowing.\\nSnow and ice just made it more pretty!',\n",
       " 'Visited here in late October. The canyon and waterfall were beautiful - a variety of colours, textures. And the surroundings were very quiet. I spent 1 hour walking through the area and enjoying the view.',\n",
       " 'The cliffs and the jagged edges were unbelievable. You good see layers of different times in the rocks. Wow a really good place to see.',\n",
       " 'Food for thought: Go early. We had the unfortunate luck of arriving at the same time as ALL the tour buses... Needless to say there was scarce room to breathe, let alone enjoy the scenery. Nothing against the site in itself, it was just too people-y for me.',\n",
       " 'Simply amazing!\\nPlease go and enjoy nature!\\nIs a must!!\\nBeautiful scenery!!\\nBreath taking.\\nBe ready to walk if you wanna see it all.',\n",
       " 'This falls is about 25 km from Jasper and is worth a visit. A spectacular geological history cab be observed from this area.',\n",
       " 'Absolutely breathtaking. Well worth the drive. Part of the Rockies at their best. Our second trip and would definitely go back again.',\n",
       " \"The Athabasca falls are about 1/2 an hour outside of Jasper - easy to find and not a bad drive to get there. Lots of parking available, trails are well marked, and points of interest clearly identified.Once there, you are immersed in the natural beauty of the area. The falls are surrounded by rock outcroppings that really make you recognize how long this area has existed. There are multiple short trails to follow, each leading to interesting findings at the end. The falls are very impressive, and fast moving. Take a couple of hours to visit this site - you won't be disappointed.\",\n",
       " 'This is a must to visit, great views and an easy drive either in your own car or on an organised tour from the local hotels.Long or short walks to see the views. Ok for fit oldies like my wife and I but could be hard work for some.Wheelchair access would be possible but not for every path, quite a lot of steps and tree roots etc. to negotiate.We took lots of pictures and spectacular scenery.Enjoy this exceptional place!Chris and Helen',\n",
       " 'Athabasca falls was an enjoyable experience. There is plenty of parking, washrooms, and information regarding the falls. The terrain is interesting and there are trails to get to and explore the different sections. The falls are located about 30 minutes or so south of Jasper, very easy to get to with good road signage. They are located just off the main highway. Overall, a fun, pleasant time.',\n",
       " 'The falls are stunning, noisy fast flowing water in beautiful surroundings. The path around the falls is really good as you get different views all around. There is also a path and steps to the bottom of the falls where the water is still and a beatiful green colour, lots of places to take in the scenery and capture photos.Like other places it was quite busy with bus tours when we visited but not over crowded to be able to enjoy the falls and the views.',\n",
       " \"The waterfall is about a 30 minute drive from the Jasper city centre. From the car park it is only a couple of minutes to walk to the waterfall. The trails are well laid out and a bridge takes you to the other side so you can take many photos from various angles. When you cross the bridge don't forget to take the trail to the right as well. This will take you down some stairs through the old Athabasca river and gives you a view of the out flow.\",\n",
       " \"A beautiful walk with amazing sights. A great place to stop and amble through the terrain taking one's time to enjoy great scenery and informative plaques.\",\n",
       " 'Easy to get to and enjoy the thunderous roar, take your time and walk all the way around. Colours are exceptional',\n",
       " 'Wonderful opportunity to go see the falls in the off season! Had an opportunity to go up to Jasper and highly recommend doing it in Oct/Nov when you pretty much have the place to yourself. Views of the Athabasca Falls and the mountains behind it were spectacular. All the mountain peaks were covered from the recent snow, but the ground down below was bare. Only a handful of people were at the falls so it was the perfect opportunity for taking pictures and enjoying the views. Being the off season, there was next to nothing for traffic coming down from Jasper on #93, so you could take your time driving to the Athabasca Falls and back. Really great destination to make for a day trip out of Edmonton and back like I did. Water was amazingly blue and the steps down to the pools below were really cool. Remember to respect the site and to pick up any garbage you bring with you. Keep it beautiful for everyone else to enjoy. :)',\n",
       " \"Hey!These Falls might not be the tallest you've ever seen,or the widest,or the most forceful,but when you tie them in with their location,their backdrop and their history,you must admit they are something special.A photographers dream,do not forget your camera,well worth the visit! Be wary,because they are something else,you,ll probably find yourself in a crowd.\",\n",
       " 'The waterfall is really beautiful and the place offers a really short hike so you can access the Athabasca river for nature photography. A really good idea to stop there on the way to Jasper. Very impressive to observe how the water makes its way through the rocks!',\n",
       " 'This is a beautiful little walk. The wonders of nature is incredible. The way the water has cut thru the rock over the centuries.',\n",
       " 'amazing waterfalls, however its very crowded during summer, on our way to Athabaska Falls, lots of fossils',\n",
       " 'Gorgeous, majestic, powerful. A wonderful stop along the Icefields Parkway - very well laid out so you get stunning views.',\n",
       " 'Only 2 min walk. You get there by the time you stretch your legs out of the car parking. Spectacular view of the falls as is all of the falls in the area. The plus is that there no hike involved.',\n",
       " 'High volume falls where the Athabasca River enters into a narrow canyon. Within a few hundred feet of large parking area near Icefields Parkway. There are several viewing platforms with great views of the falls. This is the best waterfall in Jasper National Park.',\n",
       " 'This place is amazing. The falls and the whole area is simply amazing. My sons uses a wheelchair and this place although they could have made it accessible on most places they did not so it was a bit hard to get around but the it was worth it. I recommend everyone to visit this place',\n",
       " 'Having checked out my list of stops to make on our two day visit to the Icefields Parkway, Athabaska Falls is difinitely at the top of my list. It is a powerful waterfall set on a gorgeous rock shelf. There is a trail and bridge that takes you to the far side of the river and gave even more great views. Not a long stop, but well worth your time.',\n",
       " 'Plenty of water rushing through during melt would but very good and noisy, very pretty around falls, nice gift shop',\n",
       " 'This is a must see! We did all the trails from the one that goes down to the beach below, to the one that leads up to the rapids of the falls. Spent a good 2 hours enjoying the views. An easy hike. Even for us whom arent the hiking type. Dog and family friendly.',\n",
       " 'Visited many waterfalls while I was in the Rockies and as like all the others Athabasca Falls did not disappoint us.Water flow was very high whilst on our visit which made the sound of the river and Falls even more spectacular make sure you visit when you are in the area. Plenty of parking and good walking trails are on offer for you.',\n",
       " 'Athabasca Falls was just one of our tours that our Travel agent organised for us when we visited canada, it was really interesting and lovely scenery well worth a visit',\n",
       " 'These falls are on the route from Banff to Jasper\\nThere are a few routes to take around these falls and you can explore down to the river level on the rocks. Plenty of free parking nearby making the area easily accessible.',\n",
       " 'Beautiful falls. I would recommend going early as the trails get extremely busy. It is definitely worth a stop if you are out this direction.',\n",
       " \"Travelled with Brewsters tours with driver Al.This is one of the best operators I've used. Informative but with plenty of time to explore this truly magnificent place it is one of the must see views.\",\n",
       " \"Unfortunately the falls are full of rude visitors of coaches. Although beautiful be prepared to be pushed and shoved to take a picture. My advice is to walk a bit further past the falls it's quieter and you can still get nice pics.\",\n",
       " 'Beautiful way to see how the whole area comes together from the glaciers to the falls to rivers. Pleasant walk along a safe walkway and great way to take amazing pictures',\n",
       " 'Undeniably the falls are impressive. Because it is usually in the dark it is difficult to take photos of. Also it is on the main tourist coach route, so overrun by tourists.',\n",
       " \"These were by far the most spectacular falls we stopped at whilst in the Rockies. You can't comprehend the amount of water flowing through & the noise is unbelievable. Really easy to wander round, so an easy walk for those less able. Would 100% recommend to anyone that they stop here! Make sure you walk all the way round to have a look from every angle though.\",\n",
       " 'We stopped here on our tour from Jasper to Banff. The falls are beautiful to lok at and the roar of the water is pretty loud. There were not many tourists about when we visited so we had plenty of time to look and take lots of photographs. There are quite a few vantage points located round about and information signs telling you about the falls.',\n",
       " 'What an amazing place to visit . we arrived very early in the morning and it was already packed with people and blooming selfie sticks .The breathtaking beauty made the walk in the cold and crowds worth it though.It always amazes me why people run to get to the front to take a picture ,it is almost as if the water was due to be turned off at 9.30 am :-D',\n",
       " 'Great parking; paths well prepared, and then the falls themselves are just superb, enhanced as everywhere by the emerald colour of the rock silt. Blown away.',\n",
       " 'A must see when you are in the Rockies absolutely stunning. Even my 20 year old nephew was amazed at its beauty',\n",
       " 'If you are in the area you have to stop here. While the photos are nice, being there is even more impressive.',\n",
       " \"Even in the Fall, the falls are amazing- the roar of the water through the narrow channels, turning turquoise green as it flows down river. This is a spiritual place for me.. I love it. Careful when walking- it's slippery, or icy - depending on the season!\",\n",
       " 'Visit Athabasca Falls on our way from Banff to Jasper. The view is amazing. A must visit place for everyone who visit Jasper. The blue colour water is really nice. They have a few view point area.',\n",
       " 'Only 20mins from town, well worth the drive out\\nWell maintained Easy walking trails for all ages\\nIt was beautuful',\n",
       " 'Pristine turquoise blue glacial waters flowing through a gorge cut out by glaciers...Many beautiful outlook points. Worth coming here!',\n",
       " \"Among such beautiful places to visit Athabasca Falls ranks as just nice. When along the way it is a nice stop but don't worry if you missed it.\",\n",
       " 'Wonderful Canadian Rockies and rivers along the Ice Fields Parkway. We were making our way to Lake Louise from Jasper and our friends had planned all our stops. They said we had to see Athabasca Falls. They were right. Quite a spectacular sight. I would highly recommend stopping here and taking your time taking pictures and enjoying another great spot in Canada. O Canada. You have a lot of beautiful country!']"
