      "INTRODUCTION.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Phaedrus is closely connected with the Symposium, and may be\r\n",
      "regarded either as introducing or following it. The two Dialogues\r\n",
      "together contain the whole philosophy of Plato on the nature of love,\r\n",
      "which in the Republic and in the later writings of Plato is only\r\n",
      "introduced playfully or as a figure of speech. But in the Phaedrus and\r\n",
      "Symposium love and philosophy join hands, and one is an aspect of the\r\n",
      "other. The spiritual and emotional part is elevated into the ideal, to\r\n",
      "which in the Symposium mankind are described as looking forward, and\r\n",
      "which in the Phaedrus, as well as in the Phaedo, they are seeking to\r\n",
      "recover from a former state of existence. Whether the subject of the\r\n",
      "Dialogue is love or rhetoric, or the union of the two, or the relation\r\n",
      "of philosophy to love and to art in general, and to the human soul, will\r\n",
      "be hereafter considered. And perhaps we may arrive at some conclusion\r\n",
      "such as the following--that the dialogue is not strictly confined to a\r\n",
      "single subject, but passes from one to another with the natural freedom\r\n",
      "of conversation.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Phaedrus has been spending the morning with Lysias, the celebrated\r\n",
      "rhetorician, and is going to refresh himself by taking a walk outside\r\n",
      "the wall, when he is met by Socrates, who professes that he will not\r\n",
      "leave him until he has delivered up the speech with which Lysias\r\n",
      "has regaled him, and which he is carrying about in his mind, or more\r\n",
      "probably in a book hidden under his cloak, and is intending to study\r\n",
      "as he walks. The imputation is not denied, and the two agree to direct\r\n",
      "their steps out of the public way along the stream of the Ilissus\r\n",
      "towards a plane-tree which is seen in the distance. There, lying down\r\n",
      "amidst pleasant sounds and scents, they will read the speech of Lysias.\r\n",
      "The country is a novelty to Socrates, who never goes out of the town;\r\n",
      "and hence he is full of admiration for the beauties of nature, which he\r\n",
      "seems to be drinking in for the first time.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As they are on their way, Phaedrus asks the opinion of Socrates\r\n",
      "respecting the local tradition of Boreas and Oreithyia. Socrates, after\r\n",
      "a satirical allusion to the 'rationalizers' of his day, replies that he\r\n",
      "has no time for these 'nice' interpretations of mythology, and he pities\r\n",
      "anyone who has. When you once begin there is no end of them, and they\r\n",
      "spring from an uncritical philosophy after all. 'The proper study of\r\n",
      "mankind is man;' and he is a far more complex and wonderful being than\r\n",
      "the serpent Typho. Socrates as yet does not know himself; and why should\r\n",
      "he care to know about unearthly monsters? Engaged in such conversation,\r\n",
      "they arrive at the plane-tree; when they have found a convenient\r\n",
      "resting-place, Phaedrus pulls out the speech and reads:--\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The speech consists of a foolish paradox which is to the effect that the\r\n",
      "non-lover ought to be accepted rather than the lover--because he is more\r\n",
      "rational, more agreeable, more enduring, less suspicious, less hurtful,\r\n",
      "less boastful, less engrossing, and because there are more of them, and\r\n",
      "for a great many other reasons which are equally unmeaning. Phaedrus is\r\n",
      "captivated with the beauty of the periods, and wants to make Socrates\r\n",
      "say that nothing was or ever could be written better. Socrates does not\r\n",
      "think much of the matter, but then he has only attended to the form, and\r\n",
      "in that he has detected several repetitions and other marks of haste. He\r\n",
      "cannot agree with Phaedrus in the extreme value which he sets upon this\r\n",
      "performance, because he is afraid of doing injustice to Anacreon and\r\n",
      "Sappho and other great writers, and is almost inclined to think that he\r\n",
      "himself, or rather some power residing within him, could make a speech\r\n",
      "better than that of Lysias on the same theme, and also different from\r\n",
      "his, if he may be allowed the use of a few commonplaces which all\r\n",
      "speakers must equally employ.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Phaedrus is delighted at the prospect of having another speech, and\r\n",
      "promises that he will set up a golden statue of Socrates at Delphi,\r\n",
      "if he keeps his word. Some raillery ensues, and at length Socrates,\r\n",
      "conquered by the threat that he shall never again hear a speech of\r\n",
      "Lysias unless he fulfils his promise, veils his face and begins.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "First, invoking the Muses and assuming ironically the person of the\r\n",
      "non-lover (who is a lover all the same), he will enquire into the nature\r\n",
      "and power of love. For this is a necessary preliminary to the other\r\n",
      "question--How is the non-lover to be distinguished from the lover? In\r\n",
      "all of us there are two principles--a better and a worse--reason and\r\n",
      "desire, which are generally at war with one another; and the victory\r\n",
      "of the rational is called temperance, and the victory of the irrational\r\n",
      "intemperance or excess. The latter takes many forms and has many bad\r\n",
      "names--gluttony, drunkenness, and the like. But of all the irrational\r\n",
      "desires or excesses the greatest is that which is led away by desires\r\n",
      "of a kindred nature to the enjoyment of personal beauty. And this is the\r\n",
      "master power of love.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Here Socrates fancies that he detects in himself an unusual flow\r\n",
      "of eloquence--this newly-found gift he can only attribute to the\r\n",
      "inspiration of the place, which appears to be dedicated to the nymphs.\r\n",
      "Starting again from the philosophical basis which has been laid down, he\r\n",
      "proceeds to show how many advantages the non-lover has over the lover.\r\n",
      "The one encourages softness and effeminacy and exclusiveness; he cannot\r\n",
      "endure any superiority in his beloved; he will train him in luxury, he\r\n",
      "will keep him out of society, he will deprive him of parents, friends,\r\n",
      "money, knowledge, and of every other good, that he may have him all to\r\n",
      "himself. Then again his ways are not ways of pleasantness; he is mighty\r\n",
      "disagreeable; 'crabbed age and youth cannot live together.' At every\r\n",
      "hour of the night and day he is intruding upon him; there is the\r\n",
      "same old withered face and the remainder to match--and he is always\r\n",
      "repeating, in season or out of season, the praises or dispraises of his\r\n",
      "beloved, which are bad enough when he is sober, and published all over\r\n",
      "the world when he is drunk. At length his love ceases; he is converted\r\n",
      "into an enemy, and the spectacle may be seen of the lover running away\r\n",
      "from the beloved, who pursues him with vain reproaches, and demands\r\n",
      "his reward which the other refuses to pay. Too late the beloved learns,\r\n",
      "after all his pains and disagreeables, that 'As wolves love lambs so\r\n",
      "lovers love their loves.' (Compare Char.) Here is the end; the 'other'\r\n",
      "or 'non-lover' part of the speech had better be understood, for if in\r\n",
      "the censure of the lover Socrates has broken out in verse, what will\r\n",
      "he not do in his praise of the non-lover? He has said his say and is\r\n",
      "preparing to go away.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Phaedrus begs him to remain, at any rate until the heat of noon has\r\n",
      "passed; he would like to have a little more conversation before they go.\r\n",
      "Socrates, who has risen, recognizes the oracular sign which forbids him\r\n",
      "to depart until he has done penance. His conscious has been awakened,\r\n",
      "and like Stesichorus when he had reviled the lovely Helen he will sing\r\n",
      "a palinode for having blasphemed the majesty of love. His palinode takes\r\n",
      "the form of a myth.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Socrates begins his tale with a glorification of madness, which he\r\n",
      "divides into four kinds: first, there is the art of divination or\r\n",
      "prophecy--this, in a vein similar to that pervading the Cratylus and\r\n",
      "Io, he connects with madness by an etymological explanation (mantike,\r\n",
      "manike--compare oionoistike, oionistike, ''tis all one reckoning, save\r\n",
      "the phrase is a little variations'); secondly, there is the art of\r\n",
      "purification by mysteries; thirdly, poetry or the inspiration of the\r\n",
      "Muses (compare Ion), without which no man can enter their temple. All\r\n",
      "this shows that madness is one of heaven's blessings, and may sometimes\r\n",
      "be a great deal better than sense. There is also a fourth kind of\r\n",
      "madness--that of love--which cannot be explained without enquiring into\r\n",
      "the nature of the soul.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "All soul is immortal, for she is the source of all motion both in\r\n",
      "herself and in others. Her form may be described in a figure as a\r\n",
      "composite nature made up of a charioteer and a pair of winged steeds.\r\n",
      "The steeds of the gods are immortal, but ours are one mortal and the\r\n",
      "other immortal. The immortal soul soars upwards into the heavens, but\r\n",
      "the mortal drops her plumes and settles upon the earth.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now the use of the wing is to rise and carry the downward element into\r\n",
      "the upper world--there to behold beauty, wisdom, goodness, and the other\r\n",
      "things of God by which the soul is nourished. On a certain day Zeus the\r\n",
      "lord of heaven goes forth in a winged chariot; and an array of gods\r\n",
      "and demi-gods and of human souls in their train, follows him. There are\r\n",
      "glorious and blessed sights in the interior of heaven, and he who will\r\n",
      "may freely behold them. The great vision of all is seen at the feast of\r\n",
      "the gods, when they ascend the heights of the empyrean--all but Hestia,\r\n",
      "who is left at home to keep house. The chariots of the gods glide\r\n",
      "readily upwards and stand upon the outside; the revolution of the\r\n",
      "spheres carries them round, and they have a vision of the world beyond.\r\n",
      "But the others labour in vain; for the mortal steed, if he has not been\r\n",
      "properly trained, keeps them down and sinks them towards the earth. Of\r\n",
      "the world which is beyond the heavens, who can tell? There is an essence\r\n",
      "formless, colourless, intangible, perceived by the mind only, dwelling\r\n",
      "in the region of true knowledge. The divine mind in her revolution\r\n",
      "enjoys this fair prospect, and beholds justice, temperance, and\r\n",
      "knowledge in their everlasting essence. When fulfilled with the sight\r\n",
      "of them she returns home, and the charioteer puts up the horses in their\r\n",
      "stable, and gives them ambrosia to eat and nectar to drink. This is the\r\n",
      "life of the gods; the human soul tries to reach the same heights, but\r\n",
      "hardly succeeds; and sometimes the head of the charioteer rises above,\r\n",
      "and sometimes sinks below, the fair vision, and he is at last obliged,\r\n",
      "after much contention, to turn away and leave the plain of truth. But if\r\n",
      "the soul has followed in the train of her god and once beheld truth she\r\n",
      "is preserved from harm, and is carried round in the next revolution of\r\n",
      "the spheres; and if always following, and always seeing the truth, is\r\n",
      "then for ever unharmed. If, however, she drops her wings and falls to\r\n",
      "the earth, then she takes the form of man, and the soul which has seen\r\n",
      "most of the truth passes into a philosopher or lover; that which has\r\n",
      "seen truth in the second degree, into a king or warrior; the third, into\r\n",
      "a householder or money-maker; the fourth, into a gymnast; the fifth,\r\n",
      "into a prophet or mystic; the sixth, into a poet or imitator; the\r\n",
      "seventh, into a husbandman or craftsman; the eighth, into a sophist or\r\n",
      "demagogue; the ninth, into a tyrant. All these are states of probation,\r\n",
      "wherein he who lives righteously is improved, and he who lives\r\n",
      "unrighteously deteriorates. After death comes the judgment; the bad\r\n",
      "depart to houses of correction under the earth, the good to places\r\n",
      "of joy in heaven. When a thousand years have elapsed the souls meet\r\n",
      "together and choose the lives which they will lead for another period of\r\n",
      "existence. The soul which three times in succession has chosen the life\r\n",
      "of a philosopher or of a lover who is not without philosophy receives\r\n",
      "her wings at the close of the third millennium; the remainder have to\r\n",
      "complete a cycle of ten thousand years before their wings are restored\r\n",
      "to them. Each time there is full liberty of choice. The soul of a man\r\n",
      "may descend into a beast, and return again into the form of man. But the\r\n",
      "form of man will only be taken by the soul which has once seen truth and\r\n",
      "acquired some conception of the universal:--this is the recollection of\r\n",
      "the knowledge which she attained when in the company of the Gods. And\r\n",
      "men in general recall only with difficulty the things of another world,\r\n",
      "but the mind of the philosopher has a better remembrance of them. For\r\n",
      "when he beholds the visible beauty of earth his enraptured soul passes\r\n",
      "in thought to those glorious sights of justice and wisdom and temperance\r\n",
      "and truth which she once gazed upon in heaven. Then she celebrated holy\r\n",
      "mysteries and beheld blessed apparitions shining in pure light, herself\r\n",
      "pure, and not as yet entombed in the body. And still, like a bird eager\r\n",
      "to quit its cage, she flutters and looks upwards, and is therefore\r\n",
      "deemed mad. Such a recollection of past days she receives through sight,\r\n",
      "the keenest of our senses, because beauty, alone of the ideas, has any\r\n",
      "representation on earth: wisdom is invisible to mortal eyes. But the\r\n",
      "corrupted nature, blindly excited by this vision of beauty, rushes on\r\n",
      "to enjoy, and would fain wallow like a brute beast in sensual pleasures.\r\n",
      "Whereas the true mystic, who has seen the many sights of bliss, when he\r\n",
      "beholds a god-like form or face is amazed with delight, and if he were\r\n",
      "not afraid of being thought mad he would fall down and worship. Then\r\n",
      "the stiffened wing begins to relax and grow again; desire which has\r\n",
      "been imprisoned pours over the soul of the lover; the germ of the wing\r\n",
      "unfolds, and stings, and pangs of birth, like the cutting of teeth, are\r\n",
      "everywhere felt. (Compare Symp.) Father and mother, and goods and laws\r\n",
      "and proprieties are nothing to him; his beloved is his physician, who\r\n",
      "can alone cure his pain. An apocryphal sacred writer says that the power\r\n",
      "which thus works in him is by mortals called love, but the immortals\r\n",
      "call him dove, or the winged one, in order to represent the force of\r\n",
      "his wings--such at any rate is his nature. Now the characters of lovers\r\n",
      "depend upon the god whom they followed in the other world; and they\r\n",
      "choose their loves in this world accordingly. The followers of Ares\r\n",
      "are fierce and violent; those of Zeus seek out some philosophical and\r\n",
      "imperial nature; the attendants of Here find a royal love; and in like\r\n",
      "manner the followers of every god seek a love who is like their god; and\r\n",
      "to him they communicate the nature which they have received from their\r\n",
      "god. The manner in which they take their love is as follows:--\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I told you about the charioteer and his two steeds, the one a noble\r\n",
      "animal who is guided by word and admonition only, the other an\r\n",
      "ill-looking villain who will hardly yield to blow or spur. Together all\r\n",
      "three, who are a figure of the soul, approach the vision of love. And\r\n",
      "now a fierce conflict begins. The ill-conditioned steed rushes on to\r\n",
      "enjoy, but the charioteer, who beholds the beloved with awe, falls back\r\n",
      "in adoration, and forces both the steeds on their haunches; again the\r\n",
      "evil steed rushes forwards and pulls shamelessly. The conflict grows\r\n",
      "more and more severe; and at last the charioteer, throwing himself\r\n",
      "backwards, forces the bit out of the clenched teeth of the brute, and\r\n",
      "pulling harder than ever at the reins, covers his tongue and jaws with\r\n",
      "blood, and forces him to rest his legs and haunches with pain upon the\r\n",
      "ground. When this has happened several times, the villain is tamed and\r\n",
      "humbled, and from that time forward the soul of the lover follows the\r\n",
      "beloved in modesty and holy fear. And now their bliss is consummated;\r\n",
      "the same image of love dwells in the breast of either, and if they have\r\n",
      "self-control, they pass their lives in the greatest happiness which is\r\n",
      "attainable by man--they continue masters of themselves, and conquer in\r\n",
      "one of the three heavenly victories. But if they choose the lower\r\n",
      "life of ambition they may still have a happy destiny, though inferior,\r\n",
      "because they have not the approval of the whole soul. At last they leave\r\n",
      "the body and proceed on their pilgrim's progress, and those who have\r\n",
      "once begun can never go back. When the time comes they receive their\r\n",
      "wings and fly away, and the lovers have the same wings.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Socrates concludes:--\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "These are the blessings of love, and thus have I made my recantation in\r\n",
      "finer language than before: I did so in order to please Phaedrus. If I\r\n",
      "said what was wrong at first, please to attribute my error to Lysias,\r\n",
      "who ought to study philosophy instead of rhetoric, and then he will not\r\n",
      "mislead his disciple Phaedrus.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Phaedrus is afraid that he will lose conceit of Lysias, and that Lysias\r\n",
      "will be out of conceit with himself, and leave off making speeches,\r\n",
      "for the politicians have been deriding him. Socrates is of opinion that\r\n",
      "there is small danger of this; the politicians are themselves the\r\n",
      "great rhetoricians of the age, who desire to attain immortality by the\r\n",
      "authorship of laws. And therefore there is nothing with which they can\r\n",
      "reproach Lysias in being a writer; but there may be disgrace in being a\r\n",
      "bad one.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And what is good or bad writing or speaking? While the sun is hot in the\r\n",
      "sky above us, let us ask that question: since by rational conversation\r\n",
      "man lives, and not by the indulgence of bodily pleasures. And the\r\n",
      "grasshoppers who are chirruping around may carry our words to the\r\n",
      "Muses, who are their patronesses; for the grasshoppers were human beings\r\n",
      "themselves in a world before the Muses, and when the Muses came they\r\n",
      "died of hunger for the love of song. And they carry to them in heaven\r\n",
      "the report of those who honour them on earth.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The first rule of good speaking is to know and speak the truth; as a\r\n",
      "Spartan proverb says, 'true art is truth'; whereas rhetoric is an art of\r\n",
      "enchantment, which makes things appear good and evil, like and unlike,\r\n",
      "as the speaker pleases. Its use is not confined, as people commonly\r\n",
      "suppose, to arguments in the law courts and speeches in the assembly;\r\n",
      "it is rather a part of the art of disputation, under which are included\r\n",
      "both the rules of Gorgias and the eristic of Zeno. But it is not wholly\r\n",
      "devoid of truth. Superior knowledge enables us to deceive another by the\r\n",
      "help of resemblances, and to escape from such a deception when employed\r\n",
      "against ourselves. We see therefore that even in rhetoric an element of\r\n",
      "truth is required. For if we do not know the truth, we can neither make\r\n",
      "the gradual departures from truth by which men are most easily deceived,\r\n",
      "nor guard ourselves against deception.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Socrates then proposes that they shall use the two speeches as\r\n",
      "illustrations of the art of rhetoric; first distinguishing between the\r\n",
      "debatable and undisputed class of subjects. In the debatable class there\r\n",
      "ought to be a definition of all disputed matters. But there was no such\r\n",
      "definition in the speech of Lysias; nor is there any order or connection\r\n",
      "in his words any more than in a nursery rhyme. With this he compares the\r\n",
      "regular divisions of the other speech, which was his own (and yet not\r\n",
      "his own, for the local deities must have inspired him). Although only a\r\n",
      "playful composition, it will be found to embody two principles: first,\r\n",
      "that of synthesis or the comprehension of parts in a whole; secondly,\r\n",
      "analysis, or the resolution of the whole into parts. These are the\r\n",
      "processes of division and generalization which are so dear to the\r\n",
      "dialectician, that king of men. They are effected by dialectic, and\r\n",
      "not by rhetoric, of which the remains are but scanty after order and\r\n",
      "arrangement have been subtracted. There is nothing left but a heap\r\n",
      "of 'ologies' and other technical terms invented by Polus, Theodorus,\r\n",
      "Evenus, Tisias, Gorgias, and others, who have rules for everything, and\r\n",
      "who teach how to be short or long at pleasure. Prodicus showed his good\r\n",
      "sense when he said that there was a better thing than either to be short\r\n",
      "or long, which was to be of convenient length.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Still, notwithstanding the absurdities of Polus and others, rhetoric has\r\n",
      "great power in public assemblies. This power, however, is not given by\r\n",
      "any technical rules, but is the gift of genius. The real art is always\r\n",
      "being confused by rhetoricians with the preliminaries of the art. The\r\n",
      "perfection of oratory is like the perfection of anything else; natural\r\n",
      "power must be aided by art. But the art is not that which is taught in\r\n",
      "the schools of rhetoric; it is nearer akin to philosophy. Pericles, for\r\n",
      "instance, who was the most accomplished of all speakers, derived his\r\n",
      "eloquence not from rhetoric but from the philosophy of nature which\r\n",
      "he learnt of Anaxagoras. True rhetoric is like medicine, and the\r\n",
      "rhetorician has to consider the natures of men's souls as the physician\r\n",
      "considers the natures of their bodies. Such and such persons are to be\r\n",
      "affected in this way, such and such others in that; and he must know the\r\n",
      "times and the seasons for saying this or that. This is not an easy task,\r\n",
      "and this, if there be such an art, is the art of rhetoric.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I know that there are some professors of the art who maintain\r\n",
      "probability to be stronger than truth. But we maintain that probability\r\n",
      "is engendered by likeness of the truth which can only be attained by\r\n",
      "the knowledge of it, and that the aim of the good man should not be to\r\n",
      "please or persuade his fellow-servants, but to please his good masters\r\n",
      "who are the gods. Rhetoric has a fair beginning in this.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Enough of the art of speaking; let us now proceed to consider the true\r\n",
      "use of writing. There is an old Egyptian tale of Theuth, the inventor of\r\n",
      "writing, showing his invention to the god Thamus, who told him that he\r\n",
      "would only spoil men's memories and take away their understandings. From\r\n",
      "this tale, of which young Athens will probably make fun, may be gathered\r\n",
      "the lesson that writing is inferior to speech. For it is like a picture,\r\n",
      "which can give no answer to a question, and has only a deceitful\r\n",
      "likeness of a living creature. It has no power of adaptation, but uses\r\n",
      "the same words for all. It is not a legitimate son of knowledge, but a\r\n",
      "bastard, and when an attack is made upon this bastard neither parent\r\n",
      "nor anyone else is there to defend it. The husbandman will not seriously\r\n",
      "incline to sow his seed in such a hot-bed or garden of Adonis; he will\r\n",
      "rather sow in the natural soil of the human soul which has depth of\r\n",
      "earth; and he will anticipate the inner growth of the mind, by writing\r\n",
      "only, if at all, as a remedy against old age. The natural process will\r\n",
      "be far nobler, and will bring forth fruit in the minds of others as well\r\n",
      "as in his own.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The conclusion of the whole matter is just this,--that until a man knows\r\n",
      "the truth, and the manner of adapting the truth to the natures of other\r\n",
      "men, he cannot be a good orator; also, that the living is better than\r\n",
      "the written word, and that the principles of justice and truth when\r\n",
      "delivered by word of mouth are the legitimate offspring of a man's own\r\n",
      "bosom, and their lawful descendants take up their abode in others.\r\n",
      "Such an orator as he is who is possessed of them, you and I would fain\r\n",
      "become. And to all composers in the world, poets, orators, legislators,\r\n",
      "we hereby announce that if their compositions are based upon these\r\n",
      "principles, then they are not only poets, orators, legislators, but\r\n",
      "philosophers. All others are mere flatterers and putters together of\r\n",
      "words. This is the message which Phaedrus undertakes to carry to Lysias\r\n",
      "from the local deities, and Socrates himself will carry a similar\r\n",
      "message to his favourite Isocrates, whose future distinction as a great\r\n",
      "rhetorician he prophesies. The heat of the day has passed, and after\r\n",
      "offering up a prayer to Pan and the nymphs, Socrates and Phaedrus\r\n",
      "depart.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There are two principal controversies which have been raised about the\r\n",
      "Phaedrus; the first relates to the subject, the second to the date of\r\n",
      "the Dialogue.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There seems to be a notion that the work of a great artist like Plato\r\n",
      "cannot fail in unity, and that the unity of a dialogue requires a single\r\n",
      "subject. But the conception of unity really applies in very different\r\n",
      "degrees and ways to different kinds of art; to a statue, for example,\r\n",
      "far more than to any kind of literary composition, and to some species\r\n",
      "of literature far more than to others. Nor does the dialogue appear\r\n",
      "to be a style of composition in which the requirement of unity is most\r\n",
      "stringent; nor should the idea of unity derived from one sort of art\r\n",
      "be hastily transferred to another. The double titles of several of the\r\n",
      "Platonic Dialogues are a further proof that the severer rule was not\r\n",
      "observed by Plato. The Republic is divided between the search after\r\n",
      "justice and the construction of the ideal state; the Parmenides between\r\n",
      "the criticism of the Platonic ideas and of the Eleatic one or being;\r\n",
      "the Gorgias between the art of speaking and the nature of the good;\r\n",
      "the Sophist between the detection of the Sophist and the correlation\r\n",
      "of ideas. The Theaetetus, the Politicus, and the Philebus have also\r\n",
      "digressions which are but remotely connected with the main subject.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Thus the comparison of Plato's other writings, as well as the reason of\r\n",
      "the thing, lead us to the conclusion that we must not expect to find one\r\n",
      "idea pervading a whole work, but one, two, or more, as the invention\r\n",
      "of the writer may suggest, or his fancy wander. If each dialogue were\r\n",
      "confined to the development of a single idea, this would appear on the\r\n",
      "face of the dialogue, nor could any controversy be raised as to whether\r\n",
      "the Phaedrus treated of love or rhetoric. But the truth is that Plato\r\n",
      "subjects himself to no rule of this sort. Like every great artist he\r\n",
      "gives unity of form to the different and apparently distracting topics\r\n",
      "which he brings together. He works freely and is not to be supposed to\r\n",
      "have arranged every part of the dialogue before he begins to write.\r\n",
      "He fastens or weaves together the frame of his discourse loosely and\r\n",
      "imperfectly, and which is the warp and which is the woof cannot always\r\n",
      "be determined.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The subjects of the Phaedrus (exclusive of the short introductory\r\n",
      "passage about mythology which is suggested by the local tradition) are\r\n",
      "first the false or conventional art of rhetoric; secondly, love or the\r\n",
      "inspiration of beauty and knowledge, which is described as madness;\r\n",
      "thirdly, dialectic or the art of composition and division; fourthly, the\r\n",
      "true rhetoric, which is based upon dialectic, and is neither the art of\r\n",
      "persuasion nor knowledge of the truth alone, but the art of persuasion\r\n",
      "founded on knowledge of truth and knowledge of character; fifthly, the\r\n",
      "superiority of the spoken over the written word. The continuous thread\r\n",
      "which appears and reappears throughout is rhetoric; this is the ground\r\n",
      "into which the rest of the Dialogue is worked, in parts embroidered with\r\n",
      "fine words which are not in Socrates' manner, as he says, 'in order to\r\n",
      "please Phaedrus.' The speech of Lysias which has thrown Phaedrus into an\r\n",
      "ecstacy is adduced as an example of the false rhetoric; the first speech\r\n",
      "of Socrates, though an improvement, partakes of the same character; his\r\n",
      "second speech, which is full of that higher element said to have been\r\n",
      "learned of Anaxagoras by Pericles, and which in the midst of poetry does\r\n",
      "not forget order, is an illustration of the higher or true rhetoric.\r\n",
      "This higher rhetoric is based upon dialectic, and dialectic is a sort\r\n",
      "of inspiration akin to love (compare Symp.); in these two aspects of\r\n",
      "philosophy the technicalities of rhetoric are absorbed. And so the\r\n",
      "example becomes also the deeper theme of discourse. The true knowledge\r\n",
      "of things in heaven and earth is based upon enthusiasm or love of\r\n",
      "the ideas going before us and ever present to us in this world and in\r\n",
      "another; and the true order of speech or writing proceeds accordingly.\r\n",
      "Love, again, has three degrees: first, of interested love corresponding\r\n",
      "to the conventionalities of rhetoric; secondly, of disinterested or\r\n",
      "mad love, fixed on objects of sense, and answering, perhaps, to poetry;\r\n",
      "thirdly, of disinterested love directed towards the unseen, answering\r\n",
      "to dialectic or the science of the ideas. Lastly, the art of rhetoric\r\n",
      "in the lower sense is found to rest on a knowledge of the natures and\r\n",
      "characters of men, which Socrates at the commencement of the Dialogue\r\n",
      "has described as his own peculiar study.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Thus amid discord a harmony begins to appear; there are many links of\r\n",
      "connection which are not visible at first sight. At the same time the\r\n",
      "Phaedrus, although one of the most beautiful of the Platonic Dialogues,\r\n",
      "is also more irregular than any other. For insight into the world, for\r\n",
      "sustained irony, for depth of thought, there is no Dialogue superior,\r\n",
      "or perhaps equal to it. Nevertheless the form of the work has tended to\r\n",
      "obscure some of Plato's higher aims.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The first speech is composed 'in that balanced style in which the wise\r\n",
      "love to talk' (Symp.). The characteristics of rhetoric are insipidity,\r\n",
      "mannerism, and monotonous parallelism of clauses. There is more rhythm\r\n",
      "than reason; the creative power of imagination is wanting.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "''Tis Greece, but living Greece no more.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Plato has seized by anticipation the spirit which hung over Greek\r\n",
      "literature for a thousand years afterwards. Yet doubtless there were\r\n",
      "some who, like Phaedrus, felt a delight in the harmonious cadence and\r\n",
      "the pedantic reasoning of the rhetoricians newly imported from Sicily,\r\n",
      "which had ceased to be awakened in them by really great works, such as\r\n",
      "the odes of Anacreon or Sappho or the orations of Pericles. That the\r\n",
      "first speech was really written by Lysias is improbable. Like the poem\r\n",
      "of Solon, or the story of Thamus and Theuth, or the funeral oration of\r\n",
      "Aspasia (if genuine), or the pretence of Socrates in the Cratylus that\r\n",
      "his knowledge of philology is derived from Euthyphro, the invention\r\n",
      "is really due to the imagination of Plato, and may be compared to the\r\n",
      "parodies of the Sophists in the Protagoras. Numerous fictions of this\r\n",
      "sort occur in the Dialogues, and the gravity of Plato has sometimes\r\n",
      "imposed upon his commentators. The introduction of a considerable\r\n",
      "writing of another would seem not to be in keeping with a great work of\r\n",
      "art, and has no parallel elsewhere.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In the second speech Socrates is exhibited as beating the rhetoricians\r\n",
      "at their own weapons; he 'an unpractised man and they masters of the\r\n",
      "art.' True to his character, he must, however, profess that the speech\r\n",
      "which he makes is not his own, for he knows nothing of himself. (Compare\r\n",
      "Symp.) Regarded as a rhetorical exercise, the superiority of his speech\r\n",
      "seems to consist chiefly in a better arrangement of the topics; he\r\n",
      "begins with a definition of love, and he gives weight to his words by\r\n",
      "going back to general maxims; a lesser merit is the greater liveliness\r\n",
      "of Socrates, which hurries him into verse and relieves the monotony of\r\n",
      "the style.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But Plato had doubtless a higher purpose than to exhibit Socrates as the\r\n",
      "rival or superior of the Athenian rhetoricians. Even in the speech of\r\n",
      "Lysias there is a germ of truth, and this is further developed in the\r\n",
      "parallel oration of Socrates. First, passionate love is overthrown by\r\n",
      "the sophistical or interested, and then both yield to that higher view\r\n",
      "of love which is afterwards revealed to us. The extreme of commonplace\r\n",
      "is contrasted with the most ideal and imaginative of speculations.\r\n",
      "Socrates, half in jest and to satisfy his own wild humour, takes the\r\n",
      "disguise of Lysias, but he is also in profound earnest and in a deeper\r\n",
      "vein of irony than usual. Having improvised his own speech, which is\r\n",
      "based upon the model of the preceding, he condemns them both. Yet the\r\n",
      "condemnation is not to be taken seriously, for he is evidently trying\r\n",
      "to express an aspect of the truth. To understand him, we must make\r\n",
      "abstraction of morality and of the Greek manner of regarding the\r\n",
      "relation of the sexes. In this, as in his other discussions about love,\r\n",
      "what Plato says of the loves of men must be transferred to the loves\r\n",
      "of women before we can attach any serious meaning to his words. Had he\r\n",
      "lived in our times he would have made the transposition himself. But\r\n",
      "seeing in his own age the impossibility of woman being the intellectual\r\n",
      "helpmate or friend of man (except in the rare instances of a Diotima\r\n",
      "or an Aspasia), seeing that, even as to personal beauty, her place was\r\n",
      "taken by young mankind instead of womankind, he tries to work out the\r\n",
      "problem of love without regard to the distinctions of nature. And full\r\n",
      "of the evils which he recognized as flowing from the spurious form of\r\n",
      "love, he proceeds with a deep meaning, though partly in joke, to show\r\n",
      "that the 'non-lover's' love is better than the 'lover's.'\r\n",

      "in his elevation of the reason over sense and passion, and perhaps in\r\n",
      "his doctrine of transmigration. Was he equally serious in the rest? For\r\n",
      "example, are we to attribute his tripartite division of the soul to the\r\n",
      "gods? Or is this merely assigned to them by way of parallelism with men?\r\n",

      "dualism, on the other hand, only carries out the figure of the chariot.\r\n",
      "Is he serious, again, in regarding love as 'a madness'? That seems to\r\n",
      "arise out of the antithesis to the former conception of love. At the\r\n",
      "same time he appears to intimate here, as in the Ion, Apology, Meno,\r\n",
      "and elsewhere, that there is a faculty in man, whether to be termed in\r\n",
      "modern language genius, or inspiration, or imagination, or idealism,\r\n",
      "or communion with God, which cannot be reduced to rule and measure.\r\n",
      "Perhaps, too, he is ironically repeating the common language of mankind\r\n",
      "about philosophy, and is turning their jest into a sort of earnest.\r\n",

      "the character of a god? He may have had no other account to give of\r\n",
      "the differences of human characters to which he afterwards refers. Or,\r\n",
      "again, in his absurd derivation of mantike and oionistike and imeros\r\n",
      "(compare Cratylus)? It is characteristic of the irony of Socrates to\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "As is often the case in the parables and prophecies of Scripture, the\r\n",
      "meaning is allowed to break through the figure, and the details are not\r\n",
      "always consistent. When the charioteers and their steeds stand upon the\r\n",
      "dome of heaven they behold the intangible invisible essences which\r\n",
      "are not objects of sight. This is because the force of language can\r\n",
      "no further go. Nor can we dwell much on the circumstance, that at the\r\n",
      "completion of ten thousand years all are to return to the place from\r\n",
      "whence they came; because he represents their return as dependent on\r\n",
      "their own good conduct in the successive stages of existence. Nor again\r\n",

      "to suppose this would be at variance with Plato himself and with Greek\r\n",
      "notions generally. He is much more serious in distinguishing men from\r\n",
      "animals by their recognition of the universal which they have known in\r\n",
      "a former state, and in denying that this gift of reason can ever be\r\n",
      "obliterated or lost. In the language of some modern theologians he might\r\n",

      "on their pilgrim's progress. Other intimations of a 'metaphysic' or\r\n",
      "'theology' of the future may also be discerned in him: (1) The moderate\r\n",
      "predestinarianism which here, as in the Republic, acknowledges the\r\n",
      "element of chance in human life, and yet asserts the freedom and\r\n",
      "responsibility of man; (2) The recognition of a moral as well as an\r\n",
      "intellectual principle in man under the image of an immortal steed; (3)\r\n",
      "The notion that the divine nature exists by the contemplation of\r\n",
      "ideas of virtue and justice--or, in other words, the assertion of the\r\n",
      "essentially moral nature of God; (4) Again, there is the hint that human\r\n",
      "life is a life of aspiration only, and that the true ideal is not to\r\n",
      "be found in art; (5) There occurs the first trace of the distinction\r\n",
      "between necessary and contingent matter; (6) The conception of the soul\r\n",
      "itself as the motive power and reason of the universe.\r\n",

      "in both of which the philosopher is regarded as a stranger and monster\r\n",
      "upon the earth. The whole myth, like the other myths of Plato, describes\r\n",
      "in a figure things which are beyond the range of human faculties, or\r\n",
      "inaccessible to the knowledge of the age. That philosophy should be\r\n",
      "represented as the inspiration of love is a conception that has already\r\n",
      "become familiar to us in the Symposium, and is the expression partly of\r\n",
      "Plato's enthusiasm for the idea, and is also an indication of the real\r\n",
      "power exercised by the passion of friendship over the mind of the Greek.\r\n",
      "The master in the art of love knew that there was a mystery in these\r\n",
      "feelings and their associations, and especially in the contrast of\r\n",
      "the sensible and permanent which is afforded by them; and he sought\r\n",
      "to explain this, as he explained universal ideas, by a reference to a\r\n",
      "former state of existence. The capriciousness of love is also derived\r\n",

      "remark that the beloved is more affected than the lover at the final\r\n",
      "consummation of their love, seems likewise to hint at a psychological\r\n",

      "It is difficult to exhaust the meanings of a work like the Phaedrus,\r\n",
      "which indicates so much more than it expresses; and is full of\r\n",
      "inconsistencies and ambiguities which were not perceived by Plato\r\n",
      "himself. For example, when he is speaking of the soul does he mean the\r\n",
      "human or the divine soul? and are they both equally self-moving and\r\n",
      "constructed on the same threefold principle? We should certainly be\r\n",
      "disposed to reply that the self-motive is to be attributed to God only;\r\n",
      "and on the other hand that the appetitive and passionate elements have\r\n",
      "no place in His nature. So we should infer from the reason of the thing,\r\n",
      "but there is no indication in Plato's own writings that this was his\r\n",
      "meaning. Or, again, when he explains the different characters of men\r\n",
      "by referring them back to the nature of the God whom they served in a\r\n",
      "former state of existence, we are inclined to ask whether he is serious:\r\n",
      "Is he not rather using a mythological figure, here as elsewhere, to draw\r\n",
      "a veil over things which are beyond the limits of mortal knowledge? Once\r\n",
      "more, in speaking of beauty is he really thinking of some external form\r\n",
      "such as might have been expressed in the works of Phidias or Praxiteles;\r\n",
      "and not rather of an imaginary beauty, of a sort which extinguishes\r\n",
      "rather than stimulates vulgar love,--a heavenly beauty like that which\r\n",
      "flashed from time to time before the eyes of Dante or Bunyan? Surely\r\n",
      "the latter. But it would be idle to reconcile all the details of the\r\n",
      "passage: it is a picture, not a system, and a picture which is for the\r\n",
      "greater part an allegory, and an allegory which allows the meaning to\r\n",

      "by side with the absolute forms of justice, temperance, and the like,\r\n",
      "which are abstract ideas only, and which are seen with the eye of the\r\n",
      "soul in her heavenly journey. The first impression of such a passage, in\r\n",

      "It is too often forgotten that the whole of the second discourse of\r\n",
      "Socrates is only an allegory, or figure of speech. For this reason, it\r\n",
      "is unnecessary to enquire whether the love of which Plato speaks is\r\n",
      "the love of men or of women. It is really a general idea which includes\r\n",
      "both, and in which the sensual element, though not wholly eradicated, is\r\n",
      "reduced to order and measure. We must not attribute a meaning to\r\n",
      "every fanciful detail. Nor is there any need to call up revolting\r\n",
      "associations, which as a matter of good taste should be banished, and\r\n",
      "which were far enough away from the mind of Plato. These and similar\r\n",
      "passages should be interpreted by the Laws. Nor is there anything in the\r\n",
      "Symposium, or in the Charmides, in reality inconsistent with the sterner\r\n",
      "rule which Plato lays down in the Laws. At the same time it is not to be\r\n",
      "denied that love and philosophy are described by Socrates in figures\r\n",
      "of speech which would not be used in Christian times; or that nameless\r\n",
      "vices were prevalent at Athens and in other Greek cities; or that\r\n",
      "friendships between men were a more sacred tie, and had a more important\r\n",
      "social and educational influence than among ourselves. (See note on\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "In the Phaedrus, as well as in the Symposium, there are two kinds of\r\n",
      "love, a lower and a higher, the one answering to the natural wants of\r\n",
      "the animal, the other rising above them and contemplating with religious\r\n",
      "awe the forms of justice, temperance, holiness, yet finding them\r\n",
      "also 'too dazzling bright for mortal eye,' and shrinking from them\r\n",
      "in amazement. The opposition between these two kinds of love may be\r\n",
      "compared to the opposition between the flesh and the spirit in the\r\n",
      "Epistles of St. Paul. It would be unmeaning to suppose that Plato, in\r\n",
      "describing the spiritual combat, in which the rational soul is\r\n",
      "finally victor and master of both the steeds, condescends to allow any\r\n",
      "indulgence of unnatural lusts.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Two other thoughts about love are suggested by this passage. First of\r\n",
      "all, love is represented here, as in the Symposium, as one of the great\r\n",
      "powers of nature, which takes many forms and two principal ones, having\r\n",
      "a predominant influence over the lives of men. And these two, though\r\n",
      "opposed, are not absolutely separated the one from the other. Plato,\r\n",
      "with his great knowledge of human nature, was well aware how easily\r\n",
      "one is transformed into the other, or how soon the noble but fleeting\r\n",
      "aspiration may return into the nature of the animal, while the\r\n",
      "lower instinct which is latent always remains. The intermediate\r\n",
      "sentimentalism, which has exercised so great an influence on the\r\n",
      "literature of modern Europe, had no place in the classical times of\r\n",
      "Hellas; the higher love, of which Plato speaks, is the subject, not of\r\n",
      "poetry or fiction, but of philosophy.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Secondly, there seems to be indicated a natural yearning of the human\r\n",
      "mind that the great ideas of justice, temperance, wisdom, should be\r\n",
      "expressed in some form of visible beauty, like the absolute purity and\r\n",
      "goodness which Christian art has sought to realize in the person of\r\n",
      "the Madonna. But although human nature has often attempted to represent\r\n",
      "outwardly what can be only 'spiritually discerned,' men feel that in\r\n",
      "pictures and images, whether painted or carved, or described in words\r\n",
      "only, we have not the substance but the shadow of the truth which is in\r\n",
      "heaven. There is no reason to suppose that in the fairest works of Greek\r\n",
      "art, Plato ever conceived himself to behold an image, however faint, of\r\n",
      "ideal truths. 'Not in that way was wisdom seen.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We may now pass on to the second part of the Dialogue, which is a\r\n",
      "criticism on the first. Rhetoric is assailed on various grounds: first,\r\n",
      "as desiring to persuade, without a knowledge of the truth; and secondly,\r\n",
      "as ignoring the distinction between certain and probable matter. The\r\n",
      "three speeches are then passed in review: the first of them has no\r\n",
      "definition of the nature of love, and no order in the topics (being in\r\n",
      "these respects far inferior to the second); while the third of them is\r\n",
      "found (though a fancy of the hour) to be framed upon real dialectical\r\n",
      "principles. But dialectic is not rhetoric; nothing on that subject is to\r\n",
      "be found in the endless treatises of rhetoric, however prolific in hard\r\n",
      "names. When Plato has sufficiently put them to the test of ridicule he\r\n",
      "touches, as with the point of a needle, the real error, which is the\r\n",
      "confusion of preliminary knowledge with creative power. No attainments\r\n",
      "will provide the speaker with genius; and the sort of attainments which\r\n",
      "can alone be of any value are the higher philosophy and the power of\r\n",
      "psychological analysis, which is given by dialectic, but not by the\r\n",
      "rules of the rhetoricians.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In this latter portion of the Dialogue there are many texts which may\r\n",
      "help us to speak and to think. The names dialectic and rhetoric are\r\n",
      "passing out of use; we hardly examine seriously into their nature and\r\n",
      "limits, and probably the arts both of speaking and of conversation have\r\n",
      "been unduly neglected by us. But the mind of Socrates pierces through\r\n",
      "the differences of times and countries into the essential nature of man;\r\n",
      "and his words apply equally to the modern world and to the Athenians of\r\n",
      "old. Would he not have asked of us, or rather is he not asking of us,\r\n",
      "Whether we have ceased to prefer appearances to reality? Let us take\r\n",
      "a survey of the professions to which he refers and try them by his\r\n",
      "standard. Is not all literature passing into criticism, just as Athenian\r\n",
      "literature in the age of Plato was degenerating into sophistry and\r\n",
      "rhetoric? We can discourse and write about poems and paintings, but we\r\n",
      "seem to have lost the gift of creating them. Can we wonder that few\r\n",
      "of them 'come sweetly from nature,' while ten thousand reviewers (mala\r\n",
      "murioi) are engaged in dissecting them? Young men, like Phaedrus, are\r\n",
      "enamoured of their own literary clique and have but a feeble sympathy\r\n",
      "with the master-minds of former ages. They recognize 'a POETICAL\r\n",
      "necessity in the writings of their favourite author, even when he boldly\r\n",
      "wrote off just what came in his head.' They are beginning to think that\r\n",
      "Art is enough, just at the time when Art is about to disappear from the\r\n",
      "world. And would not a great painter, such as Michael Angelo, or a great\r\n",
      "poet, such as Shakespeare, returning to earth, 'courteously rebuke'\r\n",
      "us--would he not say that we are putting 'in the place of Art the\r\n",
      "preliminaries of Art,' confusing Art the expression of mind and truth\r\n",
      "with Art the composition of colours and forms; and perhaps he might\r\n",
      "more severely chastise some of us for trying to invent 'a new shudder'\r\n",
      "instead of bringing to the birth living and healthy creations? These he\r\n",
      "would regard as the signs of an age wanting in original power.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Turning from literature and the arts to law and politics, again we fall\r\n",
      "under the lash of Socrates. For do we not often make 'the worse appear\r\n",
      "the better cause;' and do not 'both parties sometimes agree to tell\r\n",
      "lies'? Is not pleading 'an art of speaking unconnected with the truth'?\r\n",
      "There is another text of Socrates which must not be forgotten in\r\n",
      "relation to this subject. In the endless maze of English law is there\r\n",
      "any 'dividing the whole into parts or reuniting the parts into a\r\n",
      "whole'--any semblance of an organized being 'having hands and feet and\r\n",
      "other members'? Instead of a system there is the Chaos of Anaxagoras\r\n",
      "(omou panta chremata) and no Mind or Order. Then again in the noble\r\n",
      "art of politics, who thinks of first principles and of true ideas?\r\n",
      "We avowedly follow not the truth but the will of the many (compare\r\n",
      "Republic). Is not legislation too a sort of literary effort, and might\r\n",
      "not statesmanship be described as the 'art of enchanting' the house?\r\n",
      "While there are some politicians who have no knowledge of the truth, but\r\n",
      "only of what is likely to be approved by 'the many who sit in judgment,'\r\n",
      "there are others who can give no form to their ideal, neither having\r\n",
      "learned 'the art of persuasion,' nor having any insight into the\r\n",
      "'characters of men.' Once more, has not medical science become a\r\n",
      "professional routine, which many 'practise without being able to say\r\n",
      "who were their instructors'--the application of a few drugs taken from\r\n",
      "a book instead of a life-long study of the natures and constitutions of\r\n",
      "human beings? Do we see as clearly as Hippocrates 'that the nature of\r\n",
      "the body can only be understood as a whole'? (Compare Charm.) And are\r\n",
      "not they held to be the wisest physicians who have the greatest distrust\r\n",
      "of their art? What would Socrates think of our newspapers, of our\r\n",
      "theology? Perhaps he would be afraid to speak of them;--the one vox\r\n",
      "populi, the other vox Dei, he might hesitate to attack them; or he might\r\n",
      "trace a fanciful connexion between them, and ask doubtfully, whether\r\n",
      "they are not equally inspired? He would remark that we are always\r\n",
      "searching for a belief and deploring our unbelief, seeming to prefer\r\n",
      "popular opinions unverified and contradictory to unpopular truths which\r\n",
      "are assured to us by the most certain proofs: that our preachers are\r\n",
      "in the habit of praising God 'without regard to truth and falsehood,\r\n",
      "attributing to Him every species of greatness and glory, saying that He\r\n",
      "is all this and the cause of all that, in order that we may exhibit Him\r\n",
      "as the fairest and best of all' (Symp.) without any consideration of\r\n",
      "His real nature and character or of the laws by which He governs the\r\n",
      "world--seeking for a 'private judgment' and not for the truth or 'God's\r\n",
      "judgment.' What would he say of the Church, which we praise in like\r\n",
      "manner, 'meaning ourselves,' without regard to history or experience?\r\n",
      "Might he not ask, whether we 'care more for the truth of religion, or\r\n",
      "for the speaker and the country from which the truth comes'? or, whether\r\n",
      "the 'select wise' are not 'the many' after all? (Symp.) So we may fill\r\n",
      "up the sketch of Socrates, lest, as Phaedrus says, the argument should\r\n",
      "be too 'abstract and barren of illustrations.' (Compare Symp., Apol.,\r\n",
      "Euthyphro.)\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He next proceeds with enthusiasm to define the royal art of dialectic as\r\n",
      "the power of dividing a whole into parts, and of uniting the parts in a\r\n",
      "whole, and which may also be regarded (compare Soph.) as the process of\r\n",
      "the mind talking with herself. The latter view has probably led Plato\r\n",
      "to the paradox that speech is superior to writing, in which he may seem\r\n",
      "also to be doing an injustice to himself. For the two cannot be fairly\r\n",
      "compared in the manner which Plato suggests. The contrast of the living\r\n",
      "and dead word, and the example of Socrates, which he has represented\r\n",
      "in the form of the Dialogue, seem to have misled him. For speech and\r\n",
      "writing have really different functions; the one is more transitory,\r\n",
      "more diffuse, more elastic and capable of adaptation to moods and times;\r\n",
      "the other is more permanent, more concentrated, and is uttered not to\r\n",
      "this or that person or audience, but to all the world. In the Politicus\r\n",
      "the paradox is carried further; the mind or will of the king is\r\n",
      "preferred to the written law; he is supposed to be the Law personified,\r\n",
      "the ideal made Life.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Yet in both these statements there is also contained a truth; they may\r\n",
      "be compared with one another, and also with the other famous paradox,\r\n",
      "that 'knowledge cannot be taught.' Socrates means to say, that what is\r\n",
      "truly written is written in the soul, just as what is truly taught grows\r\n",
      "up in the soul from within and is not forced upon it from without. When\r\n",
      "planted in a congenial soil the little seed becomes a tree, and 'the\r\n",
      "birds of the air build their nests in the branches.' There is an echo\r\n",
      "of this in the prayer at the end of the Dialogue, 'Give me beauty in\r\n",
      "the inward soul, and may the inward and outward man be at one.' We may\r\n",
      "further compare the words of St. Paul, 'Written not on tables of stone,\r\n",
      "but on fleshly tables of the heart;' and again, 'Ye are my epistles\r\n",
      "known and read of all men.' There may be a use in writing as a\r\n",
      "preservative against the forgetfulness of old age, but to live is higher\r\n",
      "far, to be ourselves the book, or the epistle, the truth embodied in a\r\n",
      "person, the Word made flesh. Something like this we may believe to have\r\n",
      "passed before Plato's mind when he affirmed that speech was superior to\r\n",
      "writing. So in other ages, weary of literature and criticism, of making\r\n",
      "many books, of writing articles in reviews, some have desired to live\r\n",
      "more closely in communion with their fellow-men, to speak heart to\r\n",
      "heart, to speak and act only, and not to write, following the example of\r\n",
      "Socrates and of Christ...\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Some other touches of inimitable grace and art and of the deepest wisdom\r\n",
      "may be also noted; such as the prayer or 'collect' which has just been\r\n",
      "cited, 'Give me beauty,' etc.; or 'the great name which belongs to God\r\n",
      "alone;' or 'the saying of wiser men than ourselves that a man of sense\r\n",
      "should try to please not his fellow-servants, but his good and noble\r\n",
      "masters,' like St. Paul again; or the description of the 'heavenly\r\n",
      "originals'...\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The chief criteria for determining the date of the Dialogue are (1) the\r\n",
      "ages of Lysias and Isocrates; (2) the character of the work.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lysias was born in the year 458; Isocrates in the year 436, about seven\r\n",
      "years before the birth of Plato. The first of the two great rhetoricians\r\n",
      "is described as in the zenith of his fame; the second is still young and\r\n",
      "full of promise. Now it is argued that this must have been written in\r\n",
      "the youth of Isocrates, when the promise was not yet fulfilled. And thus\r\n",
      "we should have to assign the Dialogue to a year not later than 406,\r\n",
      "when Isocrates was thirty and Plato twenty-three years of age, and while\r\n",
      "Socrates himself was still alive.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Those who argue in this way seem not to reflect how easily Plato\r\n",
      "can 'invent Egyptians or anything else,' and how careless he is of\r\n",
      "historical truth or probability. Who would suspect that the wise\r\n",
      "Critias, the virtuous Charmides, had ended their lives among the\r\n",
      "thirty tyrants? Who would imagine that Lysias, who is here assailed\r\n",
      "by Socrates, is the son of his old friend Cephalus? Or that Isocrates\r\n",
      "himself is the enemy of Plato and his school? No arguments can be drawn\r\n",
      "from the appropriateness or inappropriateness of the characters of\r\n",
      "Plato. (Else, perhaps, it might be further argued that, judging from\r\n",
      "their extant remains, insipid rhetoric is far more characteristic of\r\n",
      "Isocrates than of Lysias.) But Plato makes use of names which have\r\n",
      "often hardly any connection with the historical characters to whom they\r\n",
      "belong. In this instance the comparative favour shown to Isocrates may\r\n",
      "possibly be accounted for by the circumstance of his belonging to the\r\n",
      "aristocratical, as Lysias to the democratical party.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Few persons will be inclined to suppose, in the superficial manner\r\n",
      "of some ancient critics, that a dialogue which treats of love must\r\n",
      "necessarily have been written in youth. As little weight can be attached\r\n",
      "to the argument that Plato must have visited Egypt before he wrote the\r\n",
      "story of Theuth and Thamus. For there is no real proof that he ever went\r\n",
      "to Egypt; and even if he did, he might have known or invented Egyptian\r\n",
      "traditions before he went there. The late date of the Phaedrus will have\r\n",
      "to be established by other arguments than these: the maturity of the\r\n",
      "thought, the perfection of the style, the insight, the relation to the\r\n",
      "other Platonic Dialogues, seem to contradict the notion that it could\r\n",
      "have been the work of a youth of twenty or twenty-three years of age.\r\n",
      "The cosmological notion of the mind as the primum mobile, and the\r\n",
      "admission of impulse into the immortal nature, also afford grounds for\r\n",
      "assigning a later date. (Compare Tim., Soph., Laws.) Add to this that\r\n",
      "the picture of Socrates, though in some lesser particulars,--e.g. his\r\n",
      "going without sandals, his habit of remaining within the walls,\r\n",
      "his emphatic declaration that his study is human nature,--an exact\r\n",
      "resemblance, is in the main the Platonic and not the real Socrates. Can\r\n",
      "we suppose 'the young man to have told such lies' about his master\r\n",
      "while he was still alive? Moreover, when two Dialogues are so closely\r\n",
      "connected as the Phaedrus and Symposium, there is great improbability in\r\n",
      "supposing that one of them was written at least twenty years after the\r\n",
      "other. The conclusion seems to be, that the Dialogue was written at\r\n",
      "some comparatively late but unknown period of Plato's life, after he had\r\n",
      "deserted the purely Socratic point of view, but before he had entered\r\n",
      "on the more abstract speculations of the Sophist or the Philebus. Taking\r\n",
      "into account the divisions of the soul, the doctrine of transmigration,\r\n",
      "the contemplative nature of the philosophic life, and the character\r\n",
      "of the style, we shall not be far wrong in placing the Phaedrus in the\r\n",
      "neighbourhood of the Republic; remarking only that allowance must be\r\n",
      "made for the poetical element in the Phaedrus, which, while falling\r\n",
      "short of the Republic in definite philosophic results, seems to have\r\n",
      "glimpses of a truth beyond.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Two short passages, which are unconnected with the main subject of the\r\n",
      "Dialogue, may seem to merit a more particular notice: (1) the locus\r\n",
      "classicus about mythology; (2) the tale of the grasshoppers.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The first passage is remarkable as showing that Plato was entirely\r\n",
      "free from what may be termed the Euhemerism of his age. For there were\r\n",
      "Euhemerists in Hellas long before Euhemerus. Early philosophers, like\r\n",
      "Anaxagoras and Metrodorus, had found in Homer and mythology hidden\r\n",
      "meanings. Plato, with a truer instinct, rejects these attractive\r\n",
      "interpretations; he regards the inventor of them as 'unfortunate;' and\r\n",
      "they draw a man off from the knowledge of himself. There is a latent\r\n",
      "criticism, and also a poetical sense in Plato, which enable him to\r\n",
      "discard them, and yet in another way to make use of poetry and mythology\r\n",
      "as a vehicle of thought and feeling. What would he have said of the\r\n",
      "discovery of Christian doctrines in these old Greek legends? While\r\n",
      "acknowledging that such interpretations are 'very nice,' would he not\r\n",
      "have remarked that they are found in all sacred literatures? They cannot\r\n",
      "be tested by any criterion of truth, or used to establish any truth;\r\n",
      "they add nothing to the sum of human knowledge; they are--what we\r\n",
      "please, and if employed as 'peacemakers' between the new and old are\r\n",
      "liable to serious misconstruction, as he elsewhere remarks (Republic).\r\n",
      "And therefore he would have 'bid Farewell to them; the study of them\r\n",
      "would take up too much of his time; and he has not as yet learned the\r\n",
      "true nature of religion.' The 'sophistical' interest of Phaedrus, the\r\n",
      "little touch about the two versions of the story, the ironical manner in\r\n",
      "which these explanations are set aside--'the common opinion about them\r\n",
      "is enough for me'--the allusion to the serpent Typho may be noted in\r\n",
      "passing; also the general agreement between the tone of this speech and\r\n",

      "poor one.'\r\n",

      "inform the Muses in heaven about those who honour them on earth, Plato\r\n",
      "intends to represent an Athenian audience (tettigessin eoikotes). The\r\n",

      "Rhetoric, or rather the Professors of Rhetoric who swarmed at Athens in\r\n",
      "the fourth century before Christ. As in the opening of the Dialogue he\r\n",
      "ridicules the interpreters of mythology; as in the Protagoras he mocks\r\n",
      "at the Sophists; as in the Euthydemus he makes fun of the word-splitting\r\n",
      "Eristics; as in the Cratylus he ridicules the fancies of Etymologers;\r\n",
      "as in the Meno and Gorgias and some other dialogues he makes reflections\r\n",
      "and casts sly imputation upon the higher classes at Athens; so in\r\n",
      "the Phaedrus, chiefly in the latter part, he aims his shafts at the\r\n",
      "rhetoricians. The profession of rhetoric was the greatest and most\r\n",
      "popular in Athens, necessary 'to a man's salvation,' or at any rate to\r\n",
      "his attainment of wealth or power; but Plato finds nothing wholesome\r\n",
      "or genuine in the purpose of it. It is a veritable 'sham,' having no\r\n",
      "relation to fact, or to truth of any kind. It is antipathetic to him not\r\n",
      "only as a philosopher, but also as a great writer. He cannot abide the\r\n",
      "tricks of the rhetoricians, or the pedantries and mannerisms which they\r\n",
      "introduce into speech and writing. He sees clearly how far removed they\r\n",
      "are from the ways of simplicity and truth, and how ignorant of the very\r\n",
      "elements of the art which they are professing to teach. The thing which\r\n",
      "is most necessary of all, the knowledge of human nature, is hardly if\r\n",

      "very few, are not to be found in their voluminous systems. Their\r\n",
      "pretentiousness, their omniscience, their large fortunes, their\r\n",
      "impatience of argument, their indifference to first principles, their\r\n",
      "stupidity, their progresses through Hellas accompanied by a troop\r\n",
      "of their disciples--these things were very distasteful to Plato, who\r\n",
      "esteemed genius far above art, and was quite sensible of the interval\r\n",

      "was so hopelessly below the ancient standard of classical Greek art and\r\n",
      "literature that it had no power of understanding or of valuing them. It\r\n",
      "is doubtful whether any Greek author was justly appreciated in antiquity\r\n",
      "except by his own contemporaries; and this neglect of the great authors\r\n",
      "of the past led to the disappearance of the larger part of them, while\r\n",

      "no conception of his author as a whole, and very little of the context\r\n",
      "of any passage which he was explaining. The least things were preferred\r\n",

      "countries less dried up or worn out than our own. They seem to see the\r\n",
      "withering effect of criticism on original genius. No one can doubt that\r\n",
      "such a decay or decline of literature and of art seriously affects\r\n",
      "the manners and character of a nation. It takes away half the joys and\r\n",
      "refinements of life; it increases its dulness and grossness. Hence it\r\n",
      "becomes a matter of great interest to consider how, if at all, such a\r\n",
      "degeneracy may be averted. Is there any elixir which can restore life\r\n",

      "combinations of thought and language. But, as yet, experience does\r\n",
      "not favour the realization of such a hope or promise. It may be truly\r\n",
      "answered that at present the training of teachers and the methods of\r\n",
      "education are very imperfect, and therefore that we cannot judge of the\r\n",
      "future by the present. When more of our youth are trained in the best\r\n",
      "literatures, and in the best parts of them, their minds may be expected\r\n",
      "to have a larger growth. They will have more interests, more thoughts,\r\n",
      "more material for conversation; they will have a higher standard and\r\n",
      "begin to think for themselves. The number of persons who will have the\r\n",
      "opportunity of receiving the highest education through the cheap press,\r\n",
      "and by the help of high schools and colleges, may increase tenfold. It\r\n",
      "is likely that in every thousand persons there is at least one who is\r\n",
      "far above the average in natural capacity, but the seed which is in him\r\n",
      "dies for want of cultivation. It has never had any stimulus to grow,\r\n",
      "or any field in which to blossom and produce fruit. Here is a great\r\n",
      "reservoir or treasure-house of human intelligence out of which new\r\n",
      "waters may flow and cover the earth. If at any time the great men of\r\n",
      "the world should die out, and originality or genius appear to suffer\r\n",
      "a partial eclipse, there is a boundless hope in the multitude of\r\n",
      "intelligences for future generations. They may bring gifts to men such\r\n",
      "as the world has never received before. They may begin at a higher point\r\n",
      "and yet take with them all the results of the past. The co-operation of\r\n",
      "many may have effects not less striking, though different in character\r\n",
      "from those which the creative genius of a single man, such as Bacon or\r\n",
      "Newton, formerly produced. There is also great hope to be derived, not\r\n",
      "merely from the extension of education over a wider area, but from the\r\n",
      "continuance of it during many generations. Educated parents will have\r\n",
      "children fit to receive education; and these again will grow up under\r\n",

      "which have hitherto existed in our own or in former ages.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Even if we were to suppose no more men of genius to be produced, the\r\n",
      "great writers of ancient or of modern times will remain to furnish\r\n",
      "abundant materials of education to the coming generation. Now that\r\n",
      "every nation holds communication with every other, we may truly say in\r\n",
      "a fuller sense than formerly that 'the thoughts of men are widened\r\n",
      "with the process of the suns.' They will not be 'cribbed, cabined, and\r\n",
      "confined' within a province or an island. The East will provide elements\r\n",
      "of culture to the West as well as the West to the East. The religions\r\n",
      "and literatures of the world will be open books, which he who wills may\r\n",
      "read. The human race may not be always ground down by bodily toil, but\r\n",
      "may have greater leisure for the improvement of the mind. The increasing\r\n",
      "sense of the greatness and infinity of nature will tend to awaken in men\r\n",
      "larger and more liberal thoughts. The love of mankind may be the source\r\n",
      "of a greater development of literature than nationality has ever been.\r\n",
      "There may be a greater freedom from prejudice and party; we may better\r\n",
      "understand the whereabouts of truth, and therefore there may be more\r\n",
      "success and fewer failures in the search for it. Lastly, in the coming\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "SOCRATES: I believe that the spot is not exactly here, but about a\r\n",
      "quarter of a mile lower down, where you cross to the temple of Artemis,\r\n",
      "and there is, I think, some sort of an altar of Boreas at the place.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "SOCRATES: The wise are doubtful, and I should not be singular if, like\r\n",
      "them, I too doubted. I might have a rational explanation that Orithyia\r\n",
      "was playing with Pharmacia, when a northern gust carried her over the\r\n",
      "neighbouring rocks; and this being the manner of her death, she was said\r\n",
      "to have been carried away by Boreas. There is a discrepancy, however,\r\n",
      "about the locality; according to another version of the story she was\r\n",
      "taken from Areopagus, and not from this place. Now I quite acknowledge\r\n",
      "that these allegories are very nice, but he is not to be envied who has\r\n",
      "to invent them; much labour and ingenuity will be required of him; and\r\n",
      "when he has once begun, he must go on and rehabilitate Hippocentaurs and\r\n",
      "chimeras dire. Gorgons and winged steeds flow in apace, and numberless\r\n",
      "other inconceivable and portentous natures. And if he is sceptical\r\n",
      "about them, and would fain reduce them one after another to the rules of\r\n",
      "probability, this sort of crude philosophy will take up a great deal of\r\n",

      "gentler and simpler sort, to whom Nature has given a diviner and lowlier\r\n",

      "SOCRATES: By Here, a fair resting-place, full of summer sounds and\r\n",
      "scents. Here is this lofty and spreading plane-tree, and the agnus\r\n",
      "castus high and clustering, in the fullest blossom and the greatest\r\n",
      "fragrance; and the stream which flows beneath the plane-tree is\r\n",
      "deliciously cold to the feet. Judging from the ornaments and images,\r\n",
      "this must be a spot sacred to Achelous and the Nymphs. How delightful is\r\n",
      "the breeze:--so very sweet; and there is a sound in the air shrill and\r\n",
      "summerlike which makes answer to the chorus of the cicadae. But the\r\n",
      "greatest charm of all is the grass, like a pillow gently sloping to the\r\n",

      "PHAEDRUS: What an incomprehensible being you are, Socrates: when you are\r\n",
      "in the country, as you say, you really are like some stranger who is led\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "SOCRATES: Very true, my good friend; and I hope that you will excuse me\r\n",
      "when you hear the reason, which is, that I am a lover of knowledge, and\r\n",
      "the men who dwell in the city are my teachers, and not the trees or the\r\n",
      "country. Though I do indeed believe that you have found a spell with\r\n",
      "which to draw me out of the city into the country, like a hungry cow\r\n",
      "before whom a bough or a bunch of fruit is waved. For only hold up\r\n",
      "before me in like manner a book, and you may lead me all round Attica,\r\n",
      "and over the wide world. And now having arrived, I intend to lie down,\r\n",
      "and do you choose any posture in which you can read best. Begin.\r\n",

      "PHAEDRUS: Listen. You know how matters stand with me; and how, as I\r\n",
      "conceive, this affair may be arranged for the advantage of both of us.\r\n",
      "And I maintain that I ought not to fail in my suit, because I am not\r\n",
      "your lover: for lovers repent of the kindnesses which they have shown\r\n",
      "when their passion ceases, but to the non-lovers who are free and not\r\n",
      "under any compulsion, no time of repentance ever comes; for they confer\r\n",
      "their benefits according to the measure of their ability, in the way\r\n",
      "which is most conducive to their own interest. Then again, lovers\r\n",
      "consider how by reason of their love they have neglected their own\r\n",
      "concerns and rendered service to others: and when to these benefits\r\n",
      "conferred they add on the troubles which they have endured, they think\r\n",
      "that they have long ago made to the beloved a very ample return. But the\r\n",
      "non-lover has no such tormenting recollections; he has never neglected\r\n",
      "his affairs or quarrelled with his relations; he has no troubles to\r\n",
      "add up or excuses to invent; and being well rid of all these evils, why\r\n",
      "should he not freely do what will gratify the beloved? If you say that\r\n",
      "the lover is more to be esteemed, because his love is thought to be\r\n",
      "greater; for he is willing to say and do what is hateful to other men,\r\n",
      "in order to please his beloved;--that, if true, is only a proof that he\r\n",
      "will prefer any future love to his present, and will injure his old\r\n",
      "love at the pleasure of the new. And how, in a matter of such infinite\r\n",
      "importance, can a man be right in trusting himself to one who is\r\n",
      "afflicted with a malady which no experienced person would attempt to\r\n",
      "cure, for the patient himself admits that he is not in his right mind,\r\n",
      "and acknowledges that he is wrong in his mind, but says that he is\r\n",
      "unable to control himself? And if he came to his right mind, would he\r\n",
      "ever imagine that the desires were good which he conceived when in his\r\n",
      "wrong mind? Once more, there are many more non-lovers than lovers; and\r\n",
      "if you choose the best of the lovers, you will not have many to choose\r\n",
      "from; but if from the non-lovers, the choice will be larger, and you\r\n",
      "will be far more likely to find among them a person who is worthy of\r\n",
      "your friendship. If public opinion be your dread, and you would avoid\r\n",
      "reproach, in all probability the lover, who is always thinking that\r\n",
      "other men are as emulous of him as he is of them, will boast to some\r\n",
      "one of his successes, and make a show of them openly in the pride of his\r\n",
      "heart;--he wants others to know that his labour has not been lost; but\r\n",
      "the non-lover is more his own master, and is desirous of solid good, and\r\n",
      "not of the opinion of mankind. Again, the lover may be generally noted\r\n",
      "or seen following the beloved (this is his regular occupation), and\r\n",
      "whenever they are observed to exchange two words they are supposed to\r\n",
      "meet about some affair of love either past or in contemplation; but when\r\n",
      "non-lovers meet, no one asks the reason why, because people know that\r\n",
      "talking to another is natural, whether friendship or mere pleasure\r\n",
      "be the motive. Once more, if you fear the fickleness of friendship,\r\n",
      "consider that in any other case a quarrel might be a mutual calamity;\r\n",
      "but now, when you have given up what is most precious to you, you will\r\n",
      "be the greater loser, and therefore, you will have more reason in\r\n",
      "being afraid of the lover, for his vexations are many, and he is always\r\n",
      "fancying that every one is leagued against him. Wherefore also he\r\n",
      "debars his beloved from society; he will not have you intimate with\r\n",
      "the wealthy, lest they should exceed him in wealth, or with men of\r\n",
      "education, lest they should be his superiors in understanding; and he is\r\n",
      "equally afraid of anybody's influence who has any other advantage over\r\n",
      "himself. If he can persuade you to break with them, you are left without\r\n",
      "a friend in the world; or if, out of a regard to your own interest, you\r\n",
      "have more sense than to comply with his desire, you will have to quarrel\r\n",
      "with him. But those who are non-lovers, and whose success in love is the\r\n",
      "reward of their merit, will not be jealous of the companions of their\r\n",
      "beloved, and will rather hate those who refuse to be his associates,\r\n",
      "thinking that their favourite is slighted by the latter and benefited by\r\n",
      "the former; for more love than hatred may be expected to come to him out\r\n",
      "of his friendship with others. Many lovers too have loved the person of\r\n",
      "a youth before they knew his character or his belongings; so that when\r\n",
      "their passion has passed away, there is no knowing whether they will\r\n",
      "continue to be his friends; whereas, in the case of non-lovers who were\r\n",
      "always friends, the friendship is not lessened by the favours granted;\r\n",
      "but the recollection of these remains with them, and is an earnest of\r\n",
      "good things to come.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Further, I say that you are likely to be improved by me, whereas the\r\n",
      "lover will spoil you. For they praise your words and actions in a wrong\r\n",
      "way; partly, because they are afraid of offending you, and also, their\r\n",
      "judgment is weakened by passion. Such are the feats which love exhibits;\r\n",
      "he makes things painful to the disappointed which give no pain to\r\n",
      "others; he compels the successful lover to praise what ought not to\r\n",
      "give him pleasure, and therefore the beloved is to be pitied rather\r\n",
      "than envied. But if you listen to me, in the first place, I, in my\r\n",
      "intercourse with you, shall not merely regard present enjoyment, but\r\n",
      "also future advantage, being not mastered by love, but my own master;\r\n",
      "nor for small causes taking violent dislikes, but even when the cause\r\n",
      "is great, slowly laying up little wrath--unintentional offences I shall\r\n",
      "forgive, and intentional ones I shall try to prevent; and these are the\r\n",
      "marks of a friendship which will last.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Do you think that a lover only can be a firm friend? reflect:--if this\r\n",
      "were true, we should set small value on sons, or fathers, or mothers;\r\n",
      "nor should we ever have loyal friends, for our love of them arises\r\n",
      "not from passion, but from other associations. Further, if we ought\r\n",
      "to shower favours on those who are the most eager suitors,--on that\r\n",
      "principle, we ought always to do good, not to the most virtuous, but to\r\n",
      "the most needy; for they are the persons who will be most relieved,\r\n",
      "and will therefore be the most grateful; and when you make a feast you\r\n",
      "should invite not your friend, but the beggar and the empty soul; for\r\n",
      "they will love you, and attend you, and come about your doors, and\r\n",
      "will be the best pleased, and the most grateful, and will invoke many a\r\n",
      "blessing on your head. Yet surely you ought not to be granting favours\r\n",
      "to those who besiege you with prayer, but to those who are best able to\r\n",
      "reward you; nor to the lover only, but to those who are worthy of love;\r\n",
      "nor to those who will enjoy the bloom of your youth, but to those who\r\n",
      "will share their possessions with you in age; nor to those who, having\r\n",
      "succeeded, will glory in their success to others, but to those who\r\n",
      "will be modest and tell no tales; nor to those who care about you for a\r\n",
      "moment only, but to those who will continue your friends through life;\r\n",
      "nor to those who, when their passion is over, will pick a quarrel with\r\n",
      "you, but rather to those who, when the charm of youth has left you, will\r\n",
      "show their own virtue. Remember what I have said; and consider yet this\r\n",
      "further point: friends admonish the lover under the idea that his way of\r\n",
      "life is bad, but no one of his kindred ever yet censured the non-lover,\r\n",
      "or thought that he was ill-advised about his own interests.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Perhaps you will ask me whether I propose that you should indulge every\r\n",
      "non-lover. To which I reply that not even the lover would advise you to\r\n",
      "indulge all lovers, for the indiscriminate favour is less esteemed by\r\n",
      "the rational recipient, and less easily hidden by him who would escape\r\n",
      "the censure of the world. Now love ought to be for the advantage of both\r\n",
      "parties, and for the injury of neither.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I believe that I have said enough; but if there is anything more which\r\n",

      "especially in the matter of the language?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "SOCRATES: Yes, quite admirable; the effect on me was ravishing. And this\r\n",

      "madness to be a disgrace or dishonour;--they must have thought that\r\n",
      "there was an inspired madness which was a noble thing; for the two\r\n",
      "words, mantike and manike, are really the same, and the letter tau is\r\n",
      "only a modern and tasteless insertion. And this is confirmed by the\r\n",
      "name which was given by them to the rational investigation of futurity,\r\n",
      "whether made by the help of birds or of other signs--this, for as much\r\n",
      "as it is an art which supplies from the reasoning faculty mind (nous)\r\n",
      "and information (istoria) to human thought (oiesis) they originally\r\n",
      "termed oionoistike, but the word has been lately altered and made\r\n",
      "sonorous by the modern introduction of the letter Omega (oionoistike and\r\n",
      "oionistike), and in proportion as prophecy (mantike) is more perfect and\r\n",
      "august than augury, both in name and fact, in the same proportion, as\r\n",
      "the ancients testify, is madness superior to a sane mind (sophrosune)\r\n",
      "for the one is only of human, but the other of divine origin. Again,\r\n",
      "where plagues and mightiest woes have bred in certain families, owing\r\n",
      "to some ancient blood-guiltiness, there madness has entered with holy\r\n",
      "prayers and rites, and by inspired utterances found a way of deliverance\r\n",
      "for those who are in need; and he who has part in this gift, and is\r\n",
      "truly possessed and duly out of his mind, is by the use of purifications\r\n",
      "and mysteries made whole and exempt from evil, future as well as\r\n",
      "present, and has a release from the calamity which was afflicting him.\r\n",
      "The third kind is the madness of those who are possessed by the Muses;\r\n",
      "which taking hold of a delicate and virgin soul, and there inspiring\r\n",
      "frenzy, awakens lyrical and all other numbers; with these adorning the\r\n",
      "myriad actions of ancient heroes for the instruction of posterity. But\r\n",
      "he who, having no touch of the Muses' madness in his soul, comes to the\r\n",
      "door and thinks that he will get into the temple by the help of art--he,\r\n",
      "I say, and his poetry are not admitted; the sane man disappears and is\r\n",
      "nowhere when he enters into rivalry with the madman.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I might tell of many other noble deeds which have sprung from inspired\r\n",
      "madness. And therefore, let no one frighten or flutter us by saying that\r\n",
      "the temperate friend is to be chosen rather than the inspired, but let\r\n",
      "him further show that love is not sent by the gods for any good to lover\r\n",
      "or beloved; if he can do so we will allow him to carry off the palm. And\r\n",
      "we, on our part, will prove in answer to him that the madness of love is\r\n",
      "the greatest of heaven's blessings, and the proof shall be one which the\r\n",
      "wise will receive, and the witling disbelieve. But first of all, let us\r\n",
      "view the affections and actions of the soul divine and human, and try\r\n",
      "to ascertain the truth about them. The beginning of our proof is as\r\n",
      "follows:--\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "(Translated by Cic. Tus. Quaest.) The soul through all her being is\r\n",
      "immortal, for that which is ever in motion is immortal; but that which\r\n",
      "moves another and is moved by another, in ceasing to move ceases also to\r\n",
      "live. Only the self-moving, never leaving self, never ceases to move,\r\n",
      "and is the fountain and beginning of motion to all that moves besides.\r\n",
      "Now, the beginning is unbegotten, for that which is begotten has a\r\n",
      "beginning; but the beginning is begotten of nothing, for if it were\r\n",
      "begotten of something, then the begotten would not come from a\r\n",
      "beginning. But if unbegotten, it must also be indestructible; for if\r\n",
      "beginning were destroyed, there could be no beginning out of anything,\r\n",
      "nor anything out of a beginning; and all things must have a beginning.\r\n",
      "And therefore the self-moving is the beginning of motion; and this can\r\n",
      "neither be destroyed nor begotten, else the whole heavens and all\r\n",
      "creation would collapse and stand still, and never again have motion or\r\n",
      "birth. But if the self-moving is proved to be immortal, he who affirms\r\n",
      "that self-motion is the very idea and essence of the soul will not be\r\n",
      "put to confusion. For the body which is moved from without is soulless;\r\n",
      "but that which is moved from within has a soul, for such is the nature\r\n",
      "of the soul. But if this be true, must not the soul be the self-moving,\r\n",
      "and therefore of necessity unbegotten and immortal? Enough of the soul's\r\n",
      "immortality.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Of the nature of the soul, though her true form be ever a theme of large\r\n",
      "and more than mortal discourse, let me speak briefly, and in a\r\n",
      "figure. And let the figure be composite--a pair of winged horses and a\r\n",
      "charioteer. Now the winged horses and the charioteers of the gods are\r\n",
      "all of them noble and of noble descent, but those of other races are\r\n",
      "mixed; the human charioteer drives his in a pair; and one of them is\r\n",
      "noble and of noble breed, and the other is ignoble and of ignoble breed;\r\n",
      "and the driving of them of necessity gives a great deal of trouble to\r\n",
      "him. I will endeavour to explain to you in what way the mortal differs\r\n",
      "from the immortal creature. The soul in her totality has the care of\r\n",
      "inanimate being everywhere, and traverses the whole heaven in divers\r\n",
      "forms appearing--when perfect and fully winged she soars upward, and\r\n",
      "orders the whole world; whereas the imperfect soul, losing her wings\r\n",
      "and drooping in her flight at last settles on the solid ground--there,\r\n",
      "finding a home, she receives an earthly frame which appears to be\r\n",
      "self-moved, but is really moved by her power; and this composition of\r\n",
      "soul and body is called a living and mortal creature. For immortal no\r\n",
      "such union can be reasonably believed to be; although fancy, not\r\n",
      "having seen nor surely known the nature of God, may imagine an immortal\r\n",
      "creature having both a body and also a soul which are united throughout\r\n",
      "all time. Let that, however, be as God wills, and be spoken of\r\n",
      "acceptably to him. And now let us ask the reason why the soul loses her\r\n",
      "wings!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The wing is the corporeal element which is most akin to the divine,\r\n",
      "and which by nature tends to soar aloft and carry that which gravitates\r\n",
      "downwards into the upper region, which is the habitation of the gods.\r\n",
      "The divine is beauty, wisdom, goodness, and the like; and by these the\r\n",
      "wing of the soul is nourished, and grows apace; but when fed upon evil\r\n",
      "and foulness and the opposite of good, wastes and falls away. Zeus, the\r\n",
      "mighty lord, holding the reins of a winged chariot, leads the way in\r\n",
      "heaven, ordering all and taking care of all; and there follows him the\r\n",
      "array of gods and demi-gods, marshalled in eleven bands; Hestia alone\r\n",
      "abides at home in the house of heaven; of the rest they who are reckoned\r\n",
      "among the princely twelve march in their appointed order. They see many\r\n",
      "blessed sights in the inner heaven, and there are many ways to and fro,\r\n",
      "along which the blessed gods are passing, every one doing his own\r\n",
      "work; he may follow who will and can, for jealousy has no place in the\r\n",
      "celestial choir. But when they go to banquet and festival, then they\r\n",
      "move up the steep to the top of the vault of heaven. The chariots of\r\n",
      "the gods in even poise, obeying the rein, glide rapidly; but the others\r\n",
      "labour, for the vicious steed goes heavily, weighing down the charioteer\r\n",
      "to the earth when his steed has not been thoroughly trained:--and\r\n",
      "this is the hour of agony and extremest conflict for the soul. For the\r\n",
      "immortals, when they are at the end of their course, go forth and stand\r\n",
      "upon the outside of heaven, and the revolution of the spheres carries\r\n",
      "them round, and they behold the things beyond. But of the heaven which\r\n",
      "is above the heavens, what earthly poet ever did or ever will sing\r\n",
      "worthily? It is such as I will describe; for I must dare to speak the\r\n",
      "truth, when truth is my theme. There abides the very being with which\r\n",
      "true knowledge is concerned; the colourless, formless, intangible\r\n",
      "essence, visible only to mind, the pilot of the soul. The divine\r\n",
      "intelligence, being nurtured upon mind and pure knowledge, and the\r\n",
      "intelligence of every soul which is capable of receiving the food proper\r\n",
      "to it, rejoices at beholding reality, and once more gazing upon truth,\r\n",
      "is replenished and made glad, until the revolution of the worlds\r\n",
      "brings her round again to the same place. In the revolution she beholds\r\n",
      "justice, and temperance, and knowledge absolute, not in the form of\r\n",
      "generation or of relation, which men call existence, but knowledge\r\n",
      "absolute in existence absolute; and beholding the other true existences\r\n",
      "in like manner, and feasting upon them, she passes down into the\r\n",
      "interior of the heavens and returns home; and there the charioteer\r\n",
      "putting up his horses at the stall, gives them ambrosia to eat and\r\n",
      "nectar to drink.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Such is the life of the gods; but of other souls, that which follows\r\n",
      "God best and is likest to him lifts the head of the charioteer into the\r\n",
      "outer world, and is carried round in the revolution, troubled indeed by\r\n",
      "the steeds, and with difficulty beholding true being; while another\r\n",
      "only rises and falls, and sees, and again fails to see by reason of the\r\n",
      "unruliness of the steeds. The rest of the souls are also longing after\r\n",
      "the upper world and they all follow, but not being strong enough they\r\n",
      "are carried round below the surface, plunging, treading on one another,\r\n",
      "each striving to be first; and there is confusion and perspiration and\r\n",
      "the extremity of effort; and many of them are lamed or have their wings\r\n",
      "broken through the ill-driving of the charioteers; and all of them after\r\n",
      "a fruitless toil, not having attained to the mysteries of true being,\r\n",
      "go away, and feed upon opinion. The reason why the souls exhibit this\r\n",
      "exceeding eagerness to behold the plain of truth is that pasturage is\r\n",
      "found there, which is suited to the highest part of the soul; and the\r\n",
      "wing on which the soul soars is nourished with this. And there is a law\r\n",
      "of Destiny, that the soul which attains any vision of truth in company\r\n",
      "with a god is preserved from harm until the next period, and if\r\n",
      "attaining always is always unharmed. But when she is unable to follow,\r\n",
      "and fails to behold the truth, and through some ill-hap sinks beneath\r\n",
      "the double load of forgetfulness and vice, and her wings fall from her\r\n",
      "and she drops to the ground, then the law ordains that this soul shall\r\n",
      "at her first birth pass, not into any other animal, but only into man;\r\n",
      "and the soul which has seen most of truth shall come to the birth as a\r\n",
      "philosopher, or artist, or some musical and loving nature; that which\r\n",
      "has seen truth in the second degree shall be some righteous king\r\n",
      "or warrior chief; the soul which is of the third class shall be a\r\n",
      "politician, or economist, or trader; the fourth shall be a lover of\r\n",
      "gymnastic toils, or a physician; the fifth shall lead the life of a\r\n",
      "prophet or hierophant; to the sixth the character of poet or some other\r\n",
      "imitative artist will be assigned; to the seventh the life of an artisan\r\n",
      "or husbandman; to the eighth that of a sophist or demagogue; to the\r\n",
      "ninth that of a tyrant--all these are states of probation, in which\r\n",
      "he who does righteously improves, and he who does unrighteously,\r\n",
      "deteriorates his lot.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Ten thousand years must elapse before the soul of each one can return to\r\n",
      "the place from whence she came, for she cannot grow her wings in less;\r\n",
      "only the soul of a philosopher, guileless and true, or the soul of a\r\n",
      "lover, who is not devoid of philosophy, may acquire wings in the third\r\n",
      "of the recurring periods of a thousand years; he is distinguished from\r\n",
      "the ordinary good man who gains wings in three thousand years:--and they\r\n",
      "who choose this life three times in succession have wings given them,\r\n",
      "and go away at the end of three thousand years. But the others (The\r\n",
      "philosopher alone is not subject to judgment (krisis), for he has never\r\n",
      "lost the vision of truth.) receive judgment when they have completed\r\n",
      "their first life, and after the judgment they go, some of them to the\r\n",
      "houses of correction which are under the earth, and are punished; others\r\n",
      "to some place in heaven whither they are lightly borne by justice, and\r\n",
      "there they live in a manner worthy of the life which they led here when\r\n",
      "in the form of men. And at the end of the first thousand years the good\r\n",
      "souls and also the evil souls both come to draw lots and choose their\r\n",
      "second life, and they may take any which they please. The soul of a man\r\n",
      "may pass into the life of a beast, or from the beast return again into\r\n",
      "the man. But the soul which has never seen the truth will not pass into\r\n",
      "the human form. For a man must have intelligence of universals, and be\r\n",
      "able to proceed from the many particulars of sense to one conception of\r\n",
      "reason;--this is the recollection of those things which our soul once\r\n",
      "saw while following God--when regardless of that which we now call being\r\n",
      "she raised her head up towards the true being. And therefore the mind\r\n",
      "of the philosopher alone has wings; and this is just, for he is always,\r\n",
      "according to the measure of his abilities, clinging in recollection to\r\n",
      "those things in which God abides, and in beholding which He is what He\r\n",
      "is. And he who employs aright these memories is ever being initiated\r\n",
      "into perfect mysteries and alone becomes truly perfect. But, as he\r\n",
      "forgets earthly interests and is rapt in the divine, the vulgar deem him\r\n",
      "mad, and rebuke him; they do not see that he is inspired.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Thus far I have been speaking of the fourth and last kind of madness,\r\n",
      "which is imputed to him who, when he sees the beauty of earth, is\r\n",
      "transported with the recollection of the true beauty; he would like to\r\n",
      "fly away, but he cannot; he is like a bird fluttering and looking upward\r\n",
      "and careless of the world below; and he is therefore thought to be mad.\r\n",
      "And I have shown this of all inspirations to be the noblest and highest\r\n",
      "and the offspring of the highest to him who has or shares in it, and\r\n",
      "that he who loves the beautiful is called a lover because he partakes of\r\n",
      "it. For, as has been already said, every soul of man has in the way of\r\n",
      "nature beheld true being; this was the condition of her passing into the\r\n",
      "form of man. But all souls do not easily recall the things of the other\r\n",
      "world; they may have seen them for a short time only, or they may have\r\n",
      "been unfortunate in their earthly lot, and, having had their hearts\r\n",
      "turned to unrighteousness through some corrupting influence, they may\r\n",
      "have lost the memory of the holy things which once they saw. Few only\r\n",
      "retain an adequate remembrance of them; and they, when they behold\r\n",
      "here any image of that other world, are rapt in amazement; but they\r\n",
      "are ignorant of what this rapture means, because they do not clearly\r\n",
      "perceive. For there is no light of justice or temperance or any of the\r\n",
      "higher ideas which are precious to souls in the earthly copies of them:\r\n",
      "they are seen through a glass dimly; and there are few who, going to the\r\n",
      "images, behold in them the realities, and these only with difficulty.\r\n",
      "There was a time when with the rest of the happy band they saw beauty\r\n",
      "shining in brightness,--we philosophers following in the train of Zeus,\r\n",
      "others in company with other gods; and then we beheld the beatific\r\n",
      "vision and were initiated into a mystery which may be truly called most\r\n",
      "blessed, celebrated by us in our state of innocence, before we had\r\n",
      "any experience of evils to come, when we were admitted to the sight\r\n",
      "of apparitions innocent and simple and calm and happy, which we beheld\r\n",
      "shining in pure light, pure ourselves and not yet enshrined in that\r\n",
      "living tomb which we carry about, now that we are imprisoned in the\r\n",
      "body, like an oyster in his shell. Let me linger over the memory of\r\n",
      "scenes which have passed away.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But of beauty, I repeat again that we saw her there shining in company\r\n",
      "with the celestial forms; and coming to earth we find her here too,\r\n",
      "shining in clearness through the clearest aperture of sense. For sight\r\n",
      "is the most piercing of our bodily senses; though not by that is wisdom\r\n",
      "seen; her loveliness would have been transporting if there had been\r\n",
      "a visible image of her, and the other ideas, if they had visible\r\n",
      "counterparts, would be equally lovely. But this is the privilege of\r\n",
      "beauty, that being the loveliest she is also the most palpable to sight.\r\n",
      "Now he who is not newly initiated or who has become corrupted, does not\r\n",
      "easily rise out of this world to the sight of true beauty in the other;\r\n",
      "he looks only at her earthly namesake, and instead of being awed at the\r\n",
      "sight of her, he is given over to pleasure, and like a brutish beast he\r\n",
      "rushes on to enjoy and beget; he consorts with wantonness, and is not\r\n",
      "afraid or ashamed of pursuing pleasure in violation of nature. But\r\n",
      "he whose initiation is recent, and who has been the spectator of many\r\n",
      "glories in the other world, is amazed when he sees any one having a\r\n",
      "godlike face or form, which is the expression of divine beauty; and at\r\n",
      "first a shudder runs through him, and again the old awe steals over him;\r\n",
      "then looking upon the face of his beloved as of a god he reverences him,\r\n",
      "and if he were not afraid of being thought a downright madman, he would\r\n",
      "sacrifice to his beloved as to the image of a god; then while he gazes\r\n",
      "on him there is a sort of reaction, and the shudder passes into an\r\n",
      "unusual heat and perspiration; for, as he receives the effluence of\r\n",
      "beauty through the eyes, the wing moistens and he warms. And as he\r\n",
      "warms, the parts out of which the wing grew, and which had been hitherto\r\n",
      "closed and rigid, and had prevented the wing from shooting forth, are\r\n",
      "melted, and as nourishment streams upon him, the lower end of the wing\r\n",
      "begins to swell and grow from the root upwards; and the growth extends\r\n",
      "under the whole soul--for once the whole was winged. During this process\r\n",
      "the whole soul is all in a state of ebullition and effervescence,--which\r\n",
      "may be compared to the irritation and uneasiness in the gums at the\r\n",
      "time of cutting teeth,--bubbles up, and has a feeling of uneasiness and\r\n",
      "tickling; but when in like manner the soul is beginning to grow wings,\r\n",
      "the beauty of the beloved meets her eye and she receives the sensible\r\n",
      "warm motion of particles which flow towards her, therefore called\r\n",
      "emotion (imeros), and is refreshed and warmed by them, and then she\r\n",
      "ceases from her pain with joy. But when she is parted from her beloved\r\n",
      "and her moisture fails, then the orifices of the passage out of which\r\n",
      "the wing shoots dry up and close, and intercept the germ of the wing;\r\n",
      "which, being shut up with the emotion, throbbing as with the pulsations\r\n",
      "of an artery, pricks the aperture which is nearest, until at length the\r\n",
      "entire soul is pierced and maddened and pained, and at the recollection\r\n",
      "of beauty is again delighted. And from both of them together the soul is\r\n",
      "oppressed at the strangeness of her condition, and is in a great strait\r\n",
      "and excitement, and in her madness can neither sleep by night nor abide\r\n",
      "in her place by day. And wherever she thinks that she will behold the\r\n",
      "beautiful one, thither in her desire she runs. And when she has seen\r\n",
      "him, and bathed herself in the waters of beauty, her constraint is\r\n",
      "loosened, and she is refreshed, and has no more pangs and pains; and\r\n",
      "this is the sweetest of all pleasures at the time, and is the reason\r\n",
      "why the soul of the lover will never forsake his beautiful one, whom he\r\n",
      "esteems above all; he has forgotten mother and brethren and companions,\r\n",
      "and he thinks nothing of the neglect and loss of his property; the rules\r\n",
      "and proprieties of life, on which he formerly prided himself, he now\r\n",
      "despises, and is ready to sleep like a servant, wherever he is allowed,\r\n",
      "as near as he can to his desired one, who is the object of his worship,\r\n",
      "and the physician who can alone assuage the greatness of his pain. And\r\n",
      "this state, my dear imaginary youth to whom I am talking, is by men\r\n",
      "called love, and among the gods has a name at which you, in your\r\n",
      "simplicity, may be inclined to mock; there are two lines in the\r\n",
      "apocryphal writings of Homer in which the name occurs. One of them is\r\n",
      "rather outrageous, and not altogether metrical. They are as follows:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Mortals call him fluttering love, But the immortals call him winged\r\n",
      "one, Because the growing of wings (Or, reading pterothoiton, 'the\r\n",
      "movement of wings.') is a necessity to him.'\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Now the lover who is taken to be the attendant of Zeus is better able to\r\n",

      "and companions of Ares, when under the influence of love, if they fancy\r\n",
      "that they have been at all wronged, are ready to kill and put an end\r\n",

      "imitates him, as far as he is able; and after the manner of his God he\r\n",
      "behaves in his intercourse with his beloved and with the rest of the\r\n",
      "world during the first period of his earthly existence. Every one\r\n",
      "chooses his love from the ranks of beauty according to his character,\r\n",
      "and this he makes his god, and fashions and adorns as a sort of image\r\n",
      "which he is to fall down and worship. The followers of Zeus desire that\r\n",
      "their beloved should have a soul like him; and therefore they seek out\r\n",
      "some one of a philosophical and imperial nature, and when they have\r\n",
      "found him and loved him, they do all they can to confirm such a nature\r\n",
      "in him, and if they have no experience of such a disposition hitherto,\r\n",
      "they learn of any one who can teach them, and themselves follow in the\r\n",
      "same way. And they have the less difficulty in finding the nature of\r\n",
      "their own god in themselves, because they have been compelled to gaze\r\n",
      "intensely on him; their recollection clings to him, and they become\r\n",
      "possessed of him, and receive from him their character and disposition,\r\n",
      "so far as man can participate in God. The qualities of their god they\r\n",
      "attribute to the beloved, wherefore they love him all the more, and if,\r\n",
      "like the Bacchic Nymphs, they draw inspiration from Zeus, they pour out\r\n",
      "their own fountain upon him, wanting to make him as like as possible\r\n",
      "to their own god. But those who are the followers of Here seek a royal\r\n",
      "love, and when they have found him they do just the same with him; and\r\n",
      "in like manner the followers of Apollo, and of every other god walking\r\n",
      "in the ways of their god, seek a love who is to be made like him whom\r\n",
      "they serve, and when they have found him, they themselves imitate their\r\n",
      "god, and persuade their love to do the same, and educate him into the\r\n",
      "manner and nature of the god as far as they each can; for no feelings of\r\n",
      "envy or jealousy are entertained by them towards their beloved, but they\r\n",
      "do their utmost to create in him the greatest likeness of themselves and\r\n",
      "of the god whom they honour. Thus fair and blissful to the beloved is\r\n",
      "the desire of the inspired lover, and the initiation of which I speak\r\n",
      "into the mysteries of true love, if he be captured by the lover and\r\n",
      "their purpose is effected. Now the beloved is taken captive in the\r\n",
      "following manner:--\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As I said at the beginning of this tale, I divided each soul into\r\n",
      "three--two horses and a charioteer; and one of the horses was good and\r\n",
      "the other bad: the division may remain, but I have not yet explained in\r\n",
      "what the goodness or badness of either consists, and to that I will\r\n",
      "now proceed. The right-hand horse is upright and cleanly made; he has a\r\n",
      "lofty neck and an aquiline nose; his colour is white, and his eyes dark;\r\n",
      "he is a lover of honour and modesty and temperance, and the follower\r\n",
      "of true glory; he needs no touch of the whip, but is guided by word and\r\n",
      "admonition only. The other is a crooked lumbering animal, put together\r\n",
      "anyhow; he has a short thick neck; he is flat-faced and of a dark\r\n",
      "colour, with grey eyes and blood-red complexion (Or with grey and\r\n",
      "blood-shot eyes.); the mate of insolence and pride, shag-eared and deaf,\r\n",
      "hardly yielding to whip and spur. Now when the charioteer beholds the\r\n",
      "vision of love, and has his whole soul warmed through sense, and is full\r\n",
      "of the prickings and ticklings of desire, the obedient steed, then\r\n",
      "as always under the government of shame, refrains from leaping on the\r\n",
      "beloved; but the other, heedless of the pricks and of the blows of\r\n",
      "the whip, plunges and runs away, giving all manner of trouble to his\r\n",
      "companion and the charioteer, whom he forces to approach the beloved and\r\n",
      "to remember the joys of love. They at first indignantly oppose him and\r\n",
      "will not be urged on to do terrible and unlawful deeds; but at last,\r\n",
      "when he persists in plaguing them, they yield and agree to do as he bids\r\n",
      "them. And now they are at the spot and behold the flashing beauty of the\r\n",
      "beloved; which when the charioteer sees, his memory is carried to the\r\n",
      "true beauty, whom he beholds in company with Modesty like an image\r\n",
      "placed upon a holy pedestal. He sees her, but he is afraid and falls\r\n",
      "backwards in adoration, and by his fall is compelled to pull back the\r\n",
      "reins with such violence as to bring both the steeds on their haunches,\r\n",
      "the one willing and unresisting, the unruly one very unwilling; and when\r\n",
      "they have gone back a little, the one is overcome with shame and wonder,\r\n",
      "and his whole soul is bathed in perspiration; the other, when the\r\n",
      "pain is over which the bridle and the fall had given him, having with\r\n",
      "difficulty taken breath, is full of wrath and reproaches, which he\r\n",
      "heaps upon the charioteer and his fellow-steed, for want of courage\r\n",
      "and manhood, declaring that they have been false to their agreement and\r\n",
      "guilty of desertion. Again they refuse, and again he urges them on, and\r\n",
      "will scarce yield to their prayer that he would wait until another time.\r\n",
      "When the appointed hour comes, they make as if they had forgotten, and\r\n",
      "he reminds them, fighting and neighing and dragging them on, until at\r\n",
      "length he on the same thoughts intent, forces them to draw near again.\r\n",
      "And when they are near he stoops his head and puts up his tail, and\r\n",
      "takes the bit in his teeth and pulls shamelessly. Then the charioteer is\r\n",
      "worse off than ever; he falls back like a racer at the barrier, and with\r\n",
      "a still more violent wrench drags the bit out of the teeth of the wild\r\n",
      "steed and covers his abusive tongue and jaws with blood, and forces his\r\n",
      "legs and haunches to the ground and punishes him sorely. And when this\r\n",
      "has happened several times and the villain has ceased from his wanton\r\n",
      "way, he is tamed and humbled, and follows the will of the charioteer,\r\n",
      "and when he sees the beautiful one he is ready to die of fear. And from\r\n",
      "that time forward the soul of the lover follows the beloved in modesty\r\n",
      "and holy fear.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And so the beloved who, like a god, has received every true and loyal\r\n",
      "service from his lover, not in pretence but in reality, being also\r\n",
      "himself of a nature friendly to his admirer, if in former days he\r\n",
      "has blushed to own his passion and turned away his lover, because his\r\n",
      "youthful companions or others slanderously told him that he would be\r\n",
      "disgraced, now as years advance, at the appointed age and time, is led\r\n",
      "to receive him into communion. For fate which has ordained that there\r\n",
      "shall be no friendship among the evil has also ordained that there shall\r\n",
      "ever be friendship among the good. And the beloved when he has received\r\n",
      "him into communion and intimacy, is quite amazed at the good-will of the\r\n",
      "lover; he recognises that the inspired friend is worth all other\r\n",
      "friends or kinsmen; they have nothing of friendship in them worthy to be\r\n",
      "compared with his. And when this feeling continues and he is nearer\r\n",
      "to him and embraces him, in gymnastic exercises and at other times of\r\n",
      "meeting, then the fountain of that stream, which Zeus when he was in\r\n",
      "love with Ganymede named Desire, overflows upon the lover, and some\r\n",
      "enters into his soul, and some when he is filled flows out again; and as\r\n",
      "a breeze or an echo rebounds from the smooth rocks and returns whence it\r\n",
      "came, so does the stream of beauty, passing through the eyes which are\r\n",
      "the windows of the soul, come back to the beautiful one; there arriving\r\n",
      "and quickening the passages of the wings, watering them and inclining\r\n",
      "them to grow, and filling the soul of the beloved also with love. And\r\n",
      "thus he loves, but he knows not what; he does not understand and cannot\r\n",
      "explain his own state; he appears to have caught the infection of\r\n",
      "blindness from another; the lover is his mirror in whom he is beholding\r\n",
      "himself, but he is not aware of this. When he is with the lover, both\r\n",
      "cease from their pain, but when he is away then he longs as he is\r\n",
      "longed for, and has love's image, love for love (Anteros) lodging in his\r\n",
      "breast, which he calls and believes to be not love but friendship only,\r\n",
      "and his desire is as the desire of the other, but weaker; he wants\r\n",
      "to see him, touch him, kiss him, embrace him, and probably not long\r\n",
      "afterwards his desire is accomplished. When they meet, the wanton steed\r\n",
      "of the lover has a word to say to the charioteer; he would like to have\r\n",
      "a little pleasure in return for many pains, but the wanton steed of\r\n",
      "the beloved says not a word, for he is bursting with passion which he\r\n",
      "understands not;--he throws his arms round the lover and embraces him\r\n",
      "as his dearest friend; and, when they are side by side, he is not in a\r\n",
      "state in which he can refuse the lover anything, if he ask him; although\r\n",
      "his fellow-steed and the charioteer oppose him with the arguments\r\n",
      "of shame and reason. After this their happiness depends upon their\r\n",
      "self-control; if the better elements of the mind which lead to order\r\n",
      "and philosophy prevail, then they pass their life here in happiness and\r\n",
      "harmony--masters of themselves and orderly--enslaving the vicious and\r\n",
      "emancipating the virtuous elements of the soul; and when the end comes,\r\n",
      "they are light and winged for flight, having conquered in one of the\r\n",
      "three heavenly or truly Olympian victories; nor can human discipline or\r\n",
      "divine inspiration confer any greater blessing on man than this. If,\r\n",
      "on the other hand, they leave philosophy and lead the lower life of\r\n",
      "ambition, then probably, after wine or in some other careless hour, the\r\n",
      "two wanton animals take the two souls when off their guard and bring\r\n",
      "them together, and they accomplish that desire of their hearts which to\r\n",
      "the many is bliss; and this having once enjoyed they continue to enjoy,\r\n",
      "yet rarely because they have not the approval of the whole soul. They\r\n",
      "too are dear, but not so dear to one another as the others, either at\r\n",
      "the time of their love or afterwards. They consider that they have given\r\n",
      "and taken from each other the most sacred pledges, and they may not\r\n",
      "break them and fall into enmity. At last they pass out of the body,\r\n",
      "unwinged, but eager to soar, and thus obtain no mean reward of love and\r\n",
      "madness. For those who have once begun the heavenward pilgrimage may not\r\n",
      "go down again to darkness and the journey beneath the earth, but they\r\n",
      "live in light always; happy companions in their pilgrimage, and when the\r\n",
      "time comes at which they receive their wings they have the same plumage\r\n",
      "because of their love.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Thus great are the heavenly blessings which the friendship of a lover\r\n",
      "will confer upon you, my youth. Whereas the attachment of the non-lover,\r\n",
      "which is alloyed with a worldly prudence and has worldly and niggardly\r\n",
      "ways of doling out benefits, will breed in your soul those vulgar\r\n",
      "qualities which the populace applaud, will send you bowling round the\r\n",

      "SOCRATES: My dear Phaedrus, whence come you, and whither are you going?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "PHAEDRUS: I come from Lysias the son of Cephalus, and I am going to\r\n",
      "take a walk outside the wall, for I have been sitting with him the whole\r\n",
      "morning; and our common friend Acumenus tells me that it is much more\r\n",
      "refreshing to walk in the open air than to be shut up in a cloister.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "SOCRATES: There he is right. Lysias then, I suppose, was in the town?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "PHAEDRUS: Yes, he was staying with Epicrates, here at the house of\r\n",
      "Morychus; that house which is near the temple of Olympian Zeus.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "SOCRATES: And how did he entertain you? Can I be wrong in supposing that\r\n",
      "Lysias gave you a feast of discourse?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "PHAEDRUS: You shall hear, if you can spare time to accompany me.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "SOCRATES: And should I not deem the conversation of you and Lysias 'a\r\n",
      "thing of higher import,' as I may say in the words of Pindar, 'than any\r\n",
      "business'?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "PHAEDRUS: Will you go on?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "SOCRATES: And will you go on with the narration?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "PHAEDRUS: My tale, Socrates, is one of your sort, for love was the theme\r\n",
      "which occupied us--love after a fashion: Lysias has been writing about\r\n",
      "a fair youth who was being tempted, but not by a lover; and this was\r\n",
      "the point: he ingeniously proved that the non-lover should be accepted\r\n",
      "rather than the lover.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "SOCRATES: O that is noble of him! I wish that he would say the poor man\r\n",
      "rather than the rich, and the old man rather than the young one;--then\r\n",
      "he would meet the case of me and of many a man; his words would be quite\r\n",
      "refreshing, and he would be a public benefactor. For my part, I do so\r\n",
      "long to hear his speech, that if you walk all the way to Megara, and\r\n",
      "when you have reached the wall come back, as Herodicus recommends,\r\n",
      "without going in, I will keep you company.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "PHAEDRUS: What do you mean, my good Socrates? How can you imagine that\r\n",
      "my unpractised memory can do justice to an elaborate work, which the\r\n",
      "greatest rhetorician of the age spent a long time in composing. Indeed,\r\n",
      "I cannot; I would give a great deal if I could.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "SOCRATES: I believe that I know Phaedrus about as well as I know myself,\r\n",
      "and I am very sure that the speech of Lysias was repeated to him, not\r\n",
      "once only, but again and again;--he insisted on hearing it many times\r\n",
      "over and Lysias was very willing to gratify him; at last, when nothing\r\n",
      "else would do, he got hold of the book, and looked at what he most\r\n",
      "wanted to see,--this occupied him during the whole morning;--and then\r\n",
      "when he was tired with sitting, he went out to take a walk, not until,\r\n",
      "by the dog, as I believe, he had simply learned by heart the entire\r\n",
      "discourse, unless it was unusually long, and he went to a place outside\r\n",
      "the wall that he might practise his lesson. There he saw a certain\r\n",
      "lover of discourse who had a similar weakness;--he saw and rejoiced; now\r\n",
      "thought he, 'I shall have a partner in my revels.' And he invited him to\r\n",
      "come and walk with him. But when the lover of discourse begged that he\r\n",
      "would repeat the tale, he gave himself airs and said, 'No I cannot,'\r\n",
      "as if he were indisposed; although, if the hearer had refused, he would\r\n",
      "sooner or later have been compelled by him to listen whether he would or\r\n",
      "no. Therefore, Phaedrus, bid him do at once what he will soon do whether\r\n",
      "bidden or not.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "PHAEDRUS: I see that you will not let me off until I speak in some\r\n",
      "fashion or other; verily therefore my best plan is to speak as I best\r\n",
      "can.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "SOCRATES: A very true remark, that of yours.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "PHAEDRUS: I will do as I say; but believe me, Socrates, I did not learn\r\n",
      "the very words--O no; nevertheless I have a general notion of what\r\n",
      "he said, and will give you a summary of the points in which the lover\r\n",
      "differed from the non-lover. Let me begin at the beginning.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "SOCRATES: Yes, my sweet one; but you must first of all show what you\r\n",
      "have in your left hand under your cloak, for that roll, as I suspect,\r\n",
      "is the actual discourse. Now, much as I love you, I would not have you\r\n",
      "suppose that I am going to have your memory exercised at my expense, if\r\n",
      "you have Lysias himself here.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "PHAEDRUS: Enough; I see that I have no hope of practising my art upon\r\n",
      "you. But if I am to read, where would you please to sit?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "SOCRATES: Let us turn aside and go by the Ilissus; we will sit down at\r\n",
      "some quiet spot.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "PHAEDRUS: I am fortunate in not having my sandals, and as you never have\r\n",
      "any, I think that we may go along the brook and cool our feet in the\r\n",
      "water; this will be the easiest way, and at midday and in the summer is\r\n",
      "far from being unpleasant.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "SOCRATES: Lead on, and look out for a place in which we can sit down.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "PHAEDRUS: Do you see the tallest plane-tree in the distance?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "SOCRATES: Yes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "PHAEDRUS: There are shade and gentle breezes, and grass on which we may\r\n",
      "either sit or lie down.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "SOCRATES: Move forward.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "PHAEDRUS: I should like to know, Socrates, whether the place is not\r\n",
      "somewhere here at which Boreas is said to have carried off Orithyia from\r\n",
      "the banks of the Ilissus?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "SOCRATES: Such is the tradition.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "PHAEDRUS: And is this the exact spot? The little stream is delightfully\r\n",
      "clear and bright; I can fancy that there might be maidens playing near.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "SOCRATES: I believe that the spot is not exactly here, but about a\r\n",
      "quarter of a mile lower down, where you cross to the temple of Artemis,\r\n",
      "and there is, I think, some sort of an altar of Boreas at the place.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "PHAEDRUS: I have never noticed it; but I beseech you to tell me,\r\n",
      "Socrates, do you believe this tale?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "SOCRATES: The wise are doubtful, and I should not be singular if, like\r\n",
      "them, I too doubted. I might have a rational explanation that Orithyia\r\n",
      "was playing with Pharmacia, when a northern gust carried her over the\r\n",
      "neighbouring rocks; and this being the manner of her death, she was said\r\n",
      "to have been carried away by Boreas. There is a discrepancy, however,\r\n",
      "about the locality; according to another version of the story she was\r\n",
      "taken from Areopagus, and not from this place. Now I quite acknowledge\r\n",
      "that these allegories are very nice, but he is not to be envied who has\r\n",
      "to invent them; much labour and ingenuity will be required of him; and\r\n",
      "when he has once begun, he must go on and rehabilitate Hippocentaurs and\r\n",
      "chimeras dire. Gorgons and winged steeds flow in apace, and numberless\r\n",
      "other inconceivable and portentous natures. And if he is sceptical\r\n",
      "about them, and would fain reduce them one after another to the rules of\r\n",
      "probability, this sort of crude philosophy will take up a great deal of\r\n",
      "time. Now I have no leisure for such enquiries; shall I tell you why? I\r\n",
      "must first know myself, as the Delphian inscription says; to be curious\r\n",
      "about that which is not my concern, while I am still in ignorance of my\r\n",
      "own self, would be ridiculous. And therefore I bid farewell to all this;\r\n",
      "the common opinion is enough for me. For, as I was saying, I want to\r\n",
      "know not about this, but about myself: am I a monster more complicated\r\n",
      "and swollen with passion than the serpent Typho, or a creature of a\r\n",
      "gentler and simpler sort, to whom Nature has given a diviner and lowlier\r\n",
      "destiny? But let me ask you, friend: have we not reached the plane-tree\r\n",
      "to which you were conducting us?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "PHAEDRUS: Yes, this is the tree.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "SOCRATES: By Here, a fair resting-place, full of summer sounds and\r\n",
      "scents. Here is this lofty and spreading plane-tree, and the agnus\r\n",
      "castus high and clustering, in the fullest blossom and the greatest\r\n",
      "fragrance; and the stream which flows beneath the plane-tree is\r\n",
      "deliciously cold to the feet. Judging from the ornaments and images,\r\n",
      "this must be a spot sacred to Achelous and the Nymphs. How delightful is\r\n",
      "the breeze:--so very sweet; and there is a sound in the air shrill and\r\n",
      "summerlike which makes answer to the chorus of the cicadae. But the\r\n",
      "greatest charm of all is the grass, like a pillow gently sloping to the\r\n",
      "head. My dear Phaedrus, you have been an admirable guide.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "PHAEDRUS: What an incomprehensible being you are, Socrates: when you are\r\n",
      "in the country, as you say, you really are like some stranger who is led\r\n",
      "about by a guide. Do you ever cross the border? I rather think that you\r\n",
      "never venture even outside the gates.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "SOCRATES: Very true, my good friend; and I hope that you will excuse me\r\n",
      "when you hear the reason, which is, that I am a lover of knowledge, and\r\n",
      "the men who dwell in the city are my teachers, and not the trees or the\r\n",
      "country. Though I do indeed believe that you have found a spell with\r\n",
      "which to draw me out of the city into the country, like a hungry cow\r\n",
      "before whom a bough or a bunch of fruit is waved. For only hold up\r\n",
      "before me in like manner a book, and you may lead me all round Attica,\r\n",
      "and over the wide world. And now having arrived, I intend to lie down,\r\n",
      "and do you choose any posture in which you can read best. Begin.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "PHAEDRUS: Listen. You know how matters stand with me; and how, as I\r\n",
      "conceive, this affair may be arranged for the advantage of both of us.\r\n",
      "And I maintain that I ought not to fail in my suit, because I am not\r\n",
      "your lover: for lovers repent of the kindnesses which they have shown\r\n",
      "when their passion ceases, but to the non-lovers who are free and not\r\n",
      "under any compulsion, no time of repentance ever comes; for they confer\r\n",
      "their benefits according to the measure of their ability, in the way\r\n",
      "which is most conducive to their own interest. Then again, lovers\r\n",
      "consider how by reason of their love they have neglected their own\r\n",
      "concerns and rendered service to others: and when to these benefits\r\n",
      "conferred they add on the troubles which they have endured, they think\r\n",
      "that they have long ago made to the beloved a very ample return. But the\r\n",
      "non-lover has no such tormenting recollections; he has never neglected\r\n",
      "his affairs or quarrelled with his relations; he has no troubles to\r\n",
      "add up or excuses to invent; and being well rid of all these evils, why\r\n",
      "should he not freely do what will gratify the beloved? If you say that\r\n",
      "the lover is more to be esteemed, because his love is thought to be\r\n",
      "greater; for he is willing to say and do what is hateful to other men,\r\n",
      "in order to please his beloved;--that, if true, is only a proof that he\r\n",
      "will prefer any future love to his present, and will injure his old\r\n",
      "love at the pleasure of the new. And how, in a matter of such infinite\r\n",
      "importance, can a man be right in trusting himself to one who is\r\n",
      "afflicted with a malady which no experienced person would attempt to\r\n",
      "cure, for the patient himself admits that he is not in his right mind,\r\n",
      "and acknowledges that he is wrong in his mind, but says that he is\r\n",
      "unable to control himself? And if he came to his right mind, would he\r\n",
      "ever imagine that the desires were good which he conceived when in his\r\n",
      "wrong mind? Once more, there are many more non-lovers than lovers; and\r\n",
      "if you choose the best of the lovers, you will not have many to choose\r\n",
      "from; but if from the non-lovers, the choice will be larger, and you\r\n",
      "will be far more likely to find among them a person who is worthy of\r\n",
      "your friendship. If public opinion be your dread, and you would avoid\r\n",
      "reproach, in all probability the lover, who is always thinking that\r\n",
      "other men are as emulous of him as he is of them, will boast to some\r\n",
      "one of his successes, and make a show of them openly in the pride of his\r\n",
      "heart;--he wants others to know that his labour has not been lost; but\r\n",
      "the non-lover is more his own master, and is desirous of solid good, and\r\n",
      "not of the opinion of mankind. Again, the lover may be generally noted\r\n",
      "or seen following the beloved (this is his regular occupation), and\r\n",
      "whenever they are observed to exchange two words they are supposed to\r\n",
      "meet about some affair of love either past or in contemplation; but when\r\n",
      "non-lovers meet, no one asks the reason why, because people know that\r\n",
      "talking to another is natural, whether friendship or mere pleasure\r\n",
      "be the motive. Once more, if you fear the fickleness of friendship,\r\n",
      "consider that in any other case a quarrel might be a mutual calamity;\r\n",
      "but now, when you have given up what is most precious to you, you will\r\n",
      "be the greater loser, and therefore, you will have more reason in\r\n",
      "being afraid of the lover, for his vexations are many, and he is always\r\n",
      "fancying that every one is leagued against him. Wherefore also he\r\n",
      "debars his beloved from society; he will not have you intimate with\r\n",
      "the wealthy, lest they should exceed him in wealth, or with men of\r\n",
      "education, lest they should be his superiors in understanding; and he is\r\n",
      "equally afraid of anybody's influence who has any other advantage over\r\n",
      "himself. If he can persuade you to break with them, you are left without\r\n",
      "a friend in the world; or if, out of a regard to your own interest, you\r\n",
      "have more sense than to comply with his desire, you will have to quarrel\r\n",
      "with him. But those who are non-lovers, and whose success in love is the\r\n",
      "reward of their merit, will not be jealous of the companions of their\r\n",
      "beloved, and will rather hate those who refuse to be his associates,\r\n",
      "thinking that their favourite is slighted by the latter and benefited by\r\n",
      "the former; for more love than hatred may be expected to come to him out\r\n",
      "of his friendship with others. Many lovers too have loved the person of\r\n",
      "a youth before they knew his character or his belongings; so that when\r\n",
      "their passion has passed away, there is no knowing whether they will\r\n",
      "continue to be his friends; whereas, in the case of non-lovers who were\r\n",
      "always friends, the friendship is not lessened by the favours granted;\r\n",
      "but the recollection of these remains with them, and is an earnest of\r\n",
      "good things to come.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Further, I say that you are likely to be improved by me, whereas the\r\n",
      "lover will spoil you. For they praise your words and actions in a wrong\r\n",
      "way; partly, because they are afraid of offending you, and also, their\r\n",
      "judgment is weakened by passion. Such are the feats which love exhibits;\r\n",
      "he makes things painful to the disappointed which give no pain to\r\n",
      "others; he compels the successful lover to praise what ought not to\r\n",
      "give him pleasure, and therefore the beloved is to be pitied rather\r\n",
      "than envied. But if you listen to me, in the first place, I, in my\r\n",
      "intercourse with you, shall not merely regard present enjoyment, but\r\n",
      "also future advantage, being not mastered by love, but my own master;\r\n",
      "nor for small causes taking violent dislikes, but even when the cause\r\n",
      "is great, slowly laying up little wrath--unintentional offences I shall\r\n",
      "forgive, and intentional ones I shall try to prevent; and these are the\r\n",
      "marks of a friendship which will last.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Do you think that a lover only can be a firm friend? reflect:--if this\r\n",
      "were true, we should set small value on sons, or fathers, or mothers;\r\n",
      "nor should we ever have loyal friends, for our love of them arises\r\n",
      "not from passion, but from other associations. Further, if we ought\r\n",
      "to shower favours on those who are the most eager suitors,--on that\r\n",
      "principle, we ought always to do good, not to the most virtuous, but to\r\n",
      "the most needy; for they are the persons who will be most relieved,\r\n",
      "and will therefore be the most grateful; and when you make a feast you\r\n",
      "should invite not your friend, but the beggar and the empty soul; for\r\n",
      "they will love you, and attend you, and come about your doors, and\r\n",
      "will be the best pleased, and the most grateful, and will invoke many a\r\n",
      "blessing on your head. Yet surely you ought not to be granting favours\r\n",
      "to those who besiege you with prayer, but to those who are best able to\r\n",
      "reward you; nor to the lover only, but to those who are worthy of love;\r\n",
      "nor to those who will enjoy the bloom of your youth, but to those who\r\n",
      "will share their possessions with you in age; nor to those who, having\r\n",
      "succeeded, will glory in their success to others, but to those who\r\n",
      "will be modest and tell no tales; nor to those who care about you for a\r\n",
      "moment only, but to those who will continue your friends through life;\r\n",
      "nor to those who, when their passion is over, will pick a quarrel with\r\n",
      "you, but rather to those who, when the charm of youth has left you, will\r\n",
      "show their own virtue. Remember what I have said; and consider yet this\r\n",
      "further point: friends admonish the lover under the idea that his way of\r\n",
      "life is bad, but no one of his kindred ever yet censured the non-lover,\r\n",
      "or thought that he was ill-advised about his own interests.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Perhaps you will ask me whether I propose that you should indulge every\r\n",
      "non-lover. To which I reply that not even the lover would advise you to\r\n",
      "indulge all lovers, for the indiscriminate favour is less esteemed by\r\n",
      "the rational recipient, and less easily hidden by him who would escape\r\n",
      "the censure of the world. Now love ought to be for the advantage of both\r\n",
      "parties, and for the injury of neither.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I believe that I have said enough; but if there is anything more which\r\n",
      "you desire or which in your opinion needs to be supplied, ask and I will\r\n",
      "answer.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now, Socrates, what do you think? Is not the discourse excellent, more\r\n",
      "especially in the matter of the language?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "SOCRATES: Yes, quite admirable; the effect on me was ravishing. And this\r\n",
      "I owe to you, Phaedrus, for I observed you while reading to be in an\r\n",
      "ecstasy, and thinking that you are more experienced in these matters\r\n",
      "than I am, I followed your example, and, like you, my divine darling, I\r\n",
      "became inspired with a phrenzy.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "PHAEDRUS: Indeed, you are pleased to be merry.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "SOCRATES: Do you mean that I am not in earnest?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "PHAEDRUS: Now don't talk in that way, Socrates, but let me have your\r\n",
      "real opinion; I adjure you, by Zeus, the god of friendship, to tell me\r\n",
      "whether you think that any Hellene could have said more or spoken better\r\n",
      "on the same subject.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "SOCRATES: Well, but are you and I expected to praise the sentiments\r\n",
      "of the author, or only the clearness, and roundness, and finish, and\r\n",
      "tournure of the language? As to the first I willingly submit to your\r\n",
      "better judgment, for I am not worthy to form an opinion, having only\r\n",
      "attended to the rhetorical manner; and I was doubting whether this could\r\n",
      "have been defended even by Lysias himself; I thought, though I speak\r\n",
      "under correction, that he repeated himself two or three times, either\r\n",
      "from want of words or from want of pains; and also, he appeared to me\r\n",
      "ostentatiously to exult in showing how well he could say the same thing\r\n",

      "name which was given by them to the rational investigation of futurity,\r\n",
      "whether made by the help of birds or of other signs--this, for as much\r\n",
      "as it is an art which supplies from the reasoning faculty mind (nous)\r\n",

      "august than augury, both in name and fact, in the same proportion, as\r\n",
      "the ancients testify, is madness superior to a sane mind (sophrosune)\r\n",
      "for the one is only of human, but the other of divine origin. Again,\r\n",
      "where plagues and mightiest woes have bred in certain families, owing\r\n",
      "to some ancient blood-guiltiness, there madness has entered with holy\r\n",
      "prayers and rites, and by inspired utterances found a way of deliverance\r\n",
      "for those who are in need; and he who has part in this gift, and is\r\n",
      "truly possessed and duly out of his mind, is by the use of purifications\r\n",
      "and mysteries made whole and exempt from evil, future as well as\r\n",
      "present, and has a release from the calamity which was afflicting him.\r\n",
      "The third kind is the madness of those who are possessed by the Muses;\r\n",
      "which taking hold of a delicate and virgin soul, and there inspiring\r\n",
      "frenzy, awakens lyrical and all other numbers; with these adorning the\r\n",
      "myriad actions of ancient heroes for the instruction of posterity. But\r\n",

      "I might tell of many other noble deeds which have sprung from inspired\r\n",
      "madness. And therefore, let no one frighten or flutter us by saying that\r\n",
      "the temperate friend is to be chosen rather than the inspired, but let\r\n",
      "him further show that love is not sent by the gods for any good to lover\r\n",
      "or beloved; if he can do so we will allow him to carry off the palm. And\r\n",
      "we, on our part, will prove in answer to him that the madness of love is\r\n",
      "the greatest of heaven's blessings, and the proof shall be one which the\r\n",
      "wise will receive, and the witling disbelieve. But first of all, let us\r\n",
      "view the affections and actions of the soul divine and human, and try\r\n",
      "to ascertain the truth about them. The beginning of our proof is as\r\n",
      "follows:--\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "(Translated by Cic. Tus. Quaest.) The soul through all her being is\r\n",
      "immortal, for that which is ever in motion is immortal; but that which\r\n",
      "moves another and is moved by another, in ceasing to move ceases also to\r\n",
      "live. Only the self-moving, never leaving self, never ceases to move,\r\n",
      "and is the fountain and beginning of motion to all that moves besides.\r\n",
      "Now, the beginning is unbegotten, for that which is begotten has a\r\n",
      "beginning; but the beginning is begotten of nothing, for if it were\r\n",
      "begotten of something, then the begotten would not come from a\r\n",
      "beginning. But if unbegotten, it must also be indestructible; for if\r\n",
      "beginning were destroyed, there could be no beginning out of anything,\r\n",
      "nor anything out of a beginning; and all things must have a beginning.\r\n",
      "And therefore the self-moving is the beginning of motion; and this can\r\n",
      "neither be destroyed nor begotten, else the whole heavens and all\r\n",
      "creation would collapse and stand still, and never again have motion or\r\n",
      "birth. But if the self-moving is proved to be immortal, he who affirms\r\n",
      "that self-motion is the very idea and essence of the soul will not be\r\n",
      "put to confusion. For the body which is moved from without is soulless;\r\n",
      "but that which is moved from within has a soul, for such is the nature\r\n",
      "of the soul. But if this be true, must not the soul be the self-moving,\r\n",
      "and therefore of necessity unbegotten and immortal? Enough of the soul's\r\n",
      "immortality.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Of the nature of the soul, though her true form be ever a theme of large\r\n",
      "and more than mortal discourse, let me speak briefly, and in a\r\n",
      "figure. And let the figure be composite--a pair of winged horses and a\r\n",
      "charioteer. Now the winged horses and the charioteers of the gods are\r\n",
      "all of them noble and of noble descent, but those of other races are\r\n",
      "mixed; the human charioteer drives his in a pair; and one of them is\r\n",
      "noble and of noble breed, and the other is ignoble and of ignoble breed;\r\n",
      "and the driving of them of necessity gives a great deal of trouble to\r\n",
      "him. I will endeavour to explain to you in what way the mortal differs\r\n",
      "from the immortal creature. The soul in her totality has the care of\r\n",
      "inanimate being everywhere, and traverses the whole heaven in divers\r\n",
      "forms appearing--when perfect and fully winged she soars upward, and\r\n",
      "orders the whole world; whereas the imperfect soul, losing her wings\r\n",
      "and drooping in her flight at last settles on the solid ground--there,\r\n",
      "finding a home, she receives an earthly frame which appears to be\r\n",
      "self-moved, but is really moved by her power; and this composition of\r\n",
      "soul and body is called a living and mortal creature. For immortal no\r\n",
      "such union can be reasonably believed to be; although fancy, not\r\n",
      "having seen nor surely known the nature of God, may imagine an immortal\r\n",
      "creature having both a body and also a soul which are united throughout\r\n",
      "all time. Let that, however, be as God wills, and be spoken of\r\n",
      "acceptably to him. And now let us ask the reason why the soul loses her\r\n",
      "wings!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The wing is the corporeal element which is most akin to the divine,\r\n",
      "and which by nature tends to soar aloft and carry that which gravitates\r\n",
      "downwards into the upper region, which is the habitation of the gods.\r\n",
      "The divine is beauty, wisdom, goodness, and the like; and by these the\r\n",
      "wing of the soul is nourished, and grows apace; but when fed upon evil\r\n",
      "and foulness and the opposite of good, wastes and falls away. Zeus, the\r\n",
      "mighty lord, holding the reins of a winged chariot, leads the way in\r\n",
      "heaven, ordering all and taking care of all; and there follows him the\r\n",
      "array of gods and demi-gods, marshalled in eleven bands; Hestia alone\r\n",
      "abides at home in the house of heaven; of the rest they who are reckoned\r\n",
      "among the princely twelve march in their appointed order. They see many\r\n",
      "blessed sights in the inner heaven, and there are many ways to and fro,\r\n",
      "along which the blessed gods are passing, every one doing his own\r\n",
      "work; he may follow who will and can, for jealousy has no place in the\r\n",
      "celestial choir. But when they go to banquet and festival, then they\r\n",
      "move up the steep to the top of the vault of heaven. The chariots of\r\n",
      "the gods in even poise, obeying the rein, glide rapidly; but the others\r\n",
      "labour, for the vicious steed goes heavily, weighing down the charioteer\r\n",
      "to the earth when his steed has not been thoroughly trained:--and\r\n",
      "this is the hour of agony and extremest conflict for the soul. For the\r\n",
      "immortals, when they are at the end of their course, go forth and stand\r\n",
      "upon the outside of heaven, and the revolution of the spheres carries\r\n",
      "them round, and they behold the things beyond. But of the heaven which\r\n",
      "is above the heavens, what earthly poet ever did or ever will sing\r\n",
      "worthily? It is such as I will describe; for I must dare to speak the\r\n",
      "truth, when truth is my theme. There abides the very being with which\r\n",
      "true knowledge is concerned; the colourless, formless, intangible\r\n",
      "essence, visible only to mind, the pilot of the soul. The divine\r\n",
      "intelligence, being nurtured upon mind and pure knowledge, and the\r\n",
      "intelligence of every soul which is capable of receiving the food proper\r\n",
      "to it, rejoices at beholding reality, and once more gazing upon truth,\r\n",
      "is replenished and made glad, until the revolution of the worlds\r\n",
      "brings her round again to the same place. In the revolution she beholds\r\n",
      "justice, and temperance, and knowledge absolute, not in the form of\r\n",
      "generation or of relation, which men call existence, but knowledge\r\n",
      "absolute in existence absolute; and beholding the other true existences\r\n",
      "in like manner, and feasting upon them, she passes down into the\r\n",
      "interior of the heavens and returns home; and there the charioteer\r\n",
      "putting up his horses at the stall, gives them ambrosia to eat and\r\n",
      "nectar to drink.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Such is the life of the gods; but of other souls, that which follows\r\n",
      "God best and is likest to him lifts the head of the charioteer into the\r\n",
      "outer world, and is carried round in the revolution, troubled indeed by\r\n",
      "the steeds, and with difficulty beholding true being; while another\r\n",
      "only rises and falls, and sees, and again fails to see by reason of the\r\n",
      "unruliness of the steeds. The rest of the souls are also longing after\r\n",
      "the upper world and they all follow, but not being strong enough they\r\n",
      "are carried round below the surface, plunging, treading on one another,\r\n",
      "each striving to be first; and there is confusion and perspiration and\r\n",
      "the extremity of effort; and many of them are lamed or have their wings\r\n",
      "broken through the ill-driving of the charioteers; and all of them after\r\n",
      "a fruitless toil, not having attained to the mysteries of true being,\r\n",
      "go away, and feed upon opinion. The reason why the souls exhibit this\r\n",
      "exceeding eagerness to behold the plain of truth is that pasturage is\r\n",
      "found there, which is suited to the highest part of the soul; and the\r\n",
      "wing on which the soul soars is nourished with this. And there is a law\r\n",
      "of Destiny, that the soul which attains any vision of truth in company\r\n",
      "with a god is preserved from harm until the next period, and if\r\n",
      "attaining always is always unharmed. But when she is unable to follow,\r\n",
      "and fails to behold the truth, and through some ill-hap sinks beneath\r\n",
      "the double load of forgetfulness and vice, and her wings fall from her\r\n",
      "and she drops to the ground, then the law ordains that this soul shall\r\n",
      "at her first birth pass, not into any other animal, but only into man;\r\n",
      "and the soul which has seen most of truth shall come to the birth as a\r\n",
      "philosopher, or artist, or some musical and loving nature; that which\r\n",
      "has seen truth in the second degree shall be some righteous king\r\n",
      "or warrior chief; the soul which is of the third class shall be a\r\n",
      "politician, or economist, or trader; the fourth shall be a lover of\r\n",
      "gymnastic toils, or a physician; the fifth shall lead the life of a\r\n",
      "prophet or hierophant; to the sixth the character of poet or some other\r\n",
      "imitative artist will be assigned; to the seventh the life of an artisan\r\n",
      "or husbandman; to the eighth that of a sophist or demagogue; to the\r\n",
      "ninth that of a tyrant--all these are states of probation, in which\r\n",
      "he who does righteously improves, and he who does unrighteously,\r\n",
      "deteriorates his lot.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Ten thousand years must elapse before the soul of each one can return to\r\n",
      "the place from whence she came, for she cannot grow her wings in less;\r\n",
      "only the soul of a philosopher, guileless and true, or the soul of a\r\n",
      "lover, who is not devoid of philosophy, may acquire wings in the third\r\n",
      "of the recurring periods of a thousand years; he is distinguished from\r\n",
      "the ordinary good man who gains wings in three thousand years:--and they\r\n",
      "who choose this life three times in succession have wings given them,\r\n",
      "and go away at the end of three thousand years. But the others (The\r\n",
      "philosopher alone is not subject to judgment (krisis), for he has never\r\n",
      "lost the vision of truth.) receive judgment when they have completed\r\n",
      "their first life, and after the judgment they go, some of them to the\r\n",
      "houses of correction which are under the earth, and are punished; others\r\n",
      "to some place in heaven whither they are lightly borne by justice, and\r\n",
      "there they live in a manner worthy of the life which they led here when\r\n",
      "in the form of men. And at the end of the first thousand years the good\r\n",
      "souls and also the evil souls both come to draw lots and choose their\r\n",
      "second life, and they may take any which they please. The soul of a man\r\n",
      "may pass into the life of a beast, or from the beast return again into\r\n",
      "the man. But the soul which has never seen the truth will not pass into\r\n",
      "the human form. For a man must have intelligence of universals, and be\r\n",
      "able to proceed from the many particulars of sense to one conception of\r\n",
      "reason;--this is the recollection of those things which our soul once\r\n",
      "saw while following God--when regardless of that which we now call being\r\n",
      "she raised her head up towards the true being. And therefore the mind\r\n",
      "of the philosopher alone has wings; and this is just, for he is always,\r\n",
      "according to the measure of his abilities, clinging in recollection to\r\n",
      "those things in which God abides, and in beholding which He is what He\r\n",
      "is. And he who employs aright these memories is ever being initiated\r\n",
      "into perfect mysteries and alone becomes truly perfect. But, as he\r\n",
      "forgets earthly interests and is rapt in the divine, the vulgar deem him\r\n",
      "mad, and rebuke him; they do not see that he is inspired.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Thus far I have been speaking of the fourth and last kind of madness,\r\n",
      "which is imputed to him who, when he sees the beauty of earth, is\r\n",
      "transported with the recollection of the true beauty; he would like to\r\n",
      "fly away, but he cannot; he is like a bird fluttering and looking upward\r\n",
      "and careless of the world below; and he is therefore thought to be mad.\r\n",
      "And I have shown this of all inspirations to be the noblest and highest\r\n",
      "and the offspring of the highest to him who has or shares in it, and\r\n",
      "that he who loves the beautiful is called a lover because he partakes of\r\n",
      "it. For, as has been already said, every soul of man has in the way of\r\n",
      "nature beheld true being; this was the condition of her passing into the\r\n",
      "form of man. But all souls do not easily recall the things of the other\r\n",
      "world; they may have seen them for a short time only, or they may have\r\n",
      "been unfortunate in their earthly lot, and, having had their hearts\r\n",
      "turned to unrighteousness through some corrupting influence, they may\r\n",
      "have lost the memory of the holy things which once they saw. Few only\r\n",
      "retain an adequate remembrance of them; and they, when they behold\r\n",
      "here any image of that other world, are rapt in amazement; but they\r\n",
      "are ignorant of what this rapture means, because they do not clearly\r\n",
      "perceive. For there is no light of justice or temperance or any of the\r\n",
      "higher ideas which are precious to souls in the earthly copies of them:\r\n",
      "they are seen through a glass dimly; and there are few who, going to the\r\n",
      "images, behold in them the realities, and these only with difficulty.\r\n",
      "There was a time when with the rest of the happy band they saw beauty\r\n",
      "shining in brightness,--we philosophers following in the train of Zeus,\r\n",
      "others in company with other gods; and then we beheld the beatific\r\n",
      "vision and were initiated into a mystery which may be truly called most\r\n",
      "blessed, celebrated by us in our state of innocence, before we had\r\n",
      "any experience of evils to come, when we were admitted to the sight\r\n",
      "of apparitions innocent and simple and calm and happy, which we beheld\r\n",
      "shining in pure light, pure ourselves and not yet enshrined in that\r\n",
      "living tomb which we carry about, now that we are imprisoned in the\r\n",
      "body, like an oyster in his shell. Let me linger over the memory of\r\n",
      "scenes which have passed away.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But of beauty, I repeat again that we saw her there shining in company\r\n",
      "with the celestial forms; and coming to earth we find her here too,\r\n",
      "shining in clearness through the clearest aperture of sense. For sight\r\n",
      "is the most piercing of our bodily senses; though not by that is wisdom\r\n",
      "seen; her loveliness would have been transporting if there had been\r\n",
      "a visible image of her, and the other ideas, if they had visible\r\n",
      "counterparts, would be equally lovely. But this is the privilege of\r\n",
      "beauty, that being the loveliest she is also the most palpable to sight.\r\n",
      "Now he who is not newly initiated or who has become corrupted, does not\r\n",
      "easily rise out of this world to the sight of true beauty in the other;\r\n",
      "he looks only at her earthly namesake, and instead of being awed at the\r\n",
      "sight of her, he is given over to pleasure, and like a brutish beast he\r\n",
      "rushes on to enjoy and beget; he consorts with wantonness, and is not\r\n",
      "afraid or ashamed of pursuing pleasure in violation of nature. But\r\n",
      "he whose initiation is recent, and who has been the spectator of many\r\n",
      "glories in the other world, is amazed when he sees any one having a\r\n",
      "godlike face or form, which is the expression of divine beauty; and at\r\n",
      "first a shudder runs through him, and again the old awe steals over him;\r\n",
      "then looking upon the face of his beloved as of a god he reverences him,\r\n",
      "and if he were not afraid of being thought a downright madman, he would\r\n",
      "sacrifice to his beloved as to the image of a god; then while he gazes\r\n",
      "on him there is a sort of reaction, and the shudder passes into an\r\n",
      "unusual heat and perspiration; for, as he receives the effluence of\r\n",
      "beauty through the eyes, the wing moistens and he warms. And as he\r\n",
      "warms, the parts out of which the wing grew, and which had been hitherto\r\n",
      "closed and rigid, and had prevented the wing from shooting forth, are\r\n",
      "melted, and as nourishment streams upon him, the lower end of the wing\r\n",
      "begins to swell and grow from the root upwards; and the growth extends\r\n",
      "under the whole soul--for once the whole was winged. During this process\r\n",
      "the whole soul is all in a state of ebullition and effervescence,--which\r\n",
      "may be compared to the irritation and uneasiness in the gums at the\r\n",
      "time of cutting teeth,--bubbles up, and has a feeling of uneasiness and\r\n",
      "tickling; but when in like manner the soul is beginning to grow wings,\r\n",
      "the beauty of the beloved meets her eye and she receives the sensible\r\n",
      "warm motion of particles which flow towards her, therefore called\r\n",
      "emotion (imeros), and is refreshed and warmed by them, and then she\r\n",
      "ceases from her pain with joy. But when she is parted from her beloved\r\n",
      "and her moisture fails, then the orifices of the passage out of which\r\n",
      "the wing shoots dry up and close, and intercept the germ of the wing;\r\n",
      "which, being shut up with the emotion, throbbing as with the pulsations\r\n",
      "of an artery, pricks the aperture which is nearest, until at length the\r\n",
      "entire soul is pierced and maddened and pained, and at the recollection\r\n",
      "of beauty is again delighted. And from both of them together the soul is\r\n",
      "oppressed at the strangeness of her condition, and is in a great strait\r\n",
      "and excitement, and in her madness can neither sleep by night nor abide\r\n",
      "in her place by day. And wherever she thinks that she will behold the\r\n",
      "beautiful one, thither in her desire she runs. And when she has seen\r\n",
      "him, and bathed herself in the waters of beauty, her constraint is\r\n",
      "loosened, and she is refreshed, and has no more pangs and pains; and\r\n",
      "this is the sweetest of all pleasures at the time, and is the reason\r\n",
      "why the soul of the lover will never forsake his beautiful one, whom he\r\n",
      "esteems above all; he has forgotten mother and brethren and companions,\r\n",
      "and he thinks nothing of the neglect and loss of his property; the rules\r\n",
      "and proprieties of life, on which he formerly prided himself, he now\r\n",
      "despises, and is ready to sleep like a servant, wherever he is allowed,\r\n",
      "as near as he can to his desired one, who is the object of his worship,\r\n",
      "and the physician who can alone assuage the greatness of his pain. And\r\n",
      "this state, my dear imaginary youth to whom I am talking, is by men\r\n",
      "called love, and among the gods has a name at which you, in your\r\n",
      "simplicity, may be inclined to mock; there are two lines in the\r\n",
      "apocryphal writings of Homer in which the name occurs. One of them is\r\n",
      "rather outrageous, and not altogether metrical. They are as follows:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Mortals call him fluttering love, But the immortals call him winged\r\n",
      "one, Because the growing of wings (Or, reading pterothoiton, 'the\r\n",
      "movement of wings.') is a necessity to him.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "You may believe this, but not unless you like. At any rate the loves of\r\n",
      "lovers and their causes are such as I have described.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now the lover who is taken to be the attendant of Zeus is better able to\r\n",
      "bear the winged god, and can endure a heavier burden; but the attendants\r\n",
      "and companions of Ares, when under the influence of love, if they fancy\r\n",
      "that they have been at all wronged, are ready to kill and put an end\r\n",
      "to themselves and their beloved. And he who follows in the train of any\r\n",
      "other god, while he is unspoiled and the impression lasts, honours and\r\n",
      "imitates him, as far as he is able; and after the manner of his God he\r\n",
      "behaves in his intercourse with his beloved and with the rest of the\r\n",
      "world during the first period of his earthly existence. Every one\r\n",
      "chooses his love from the ranks of beauty according to his character,\r\n",
      "and this he makes his god, and fashions and adorns as a sort of image\r\n",
      "which he is to fall down and worship. The followers of Zeus desire that\r\n",
      "their beloved should have a soul like him; and therefore they seek out\r\n",
      "some one of a philosophical and imperial nature, and when they have\r\n",
      "found him and loved him, they do all they can to confirm such a nature\r\n",
      "in him, and if they have no experience of such a disposition hitherto,\r\n",
      "they learn of any one who can teach them, and themselves follow in the\r\n",
      "same way. And they have the less difficulty in finding the nature of\r\n",
      "their own god in themselves, because they have been compelled to gaze\r\n",
      "intensely on him; their recollection clings to him, and they become\r\n",
      "possessed of him, and receive from him their character and disposition,\r\n",
      "so far as man can participate in God. The qualities of their god they\r\n",
      "attribute to the beloved, wherefore they love him all the more, and if,\r\n",
      "like the Bacchic Nymphs, they draw inspiration from Zeus, they pour out\r\n",
      "their own fountain upon him, wanting to make him as like as possible\r\n",
      "to their own god. But those who are the followers of Here seek a royal\r\n",
      "love, and when they have found him they do just the same with him; and\r\n",
      "in like manner the followers of Apollo, and of every other god walking\r\n",
      "in the ways of their god, seek a love who is to be made like him whom\r\n",
      "they serve, and when they have found him, they themselves imitate their\r\n",
      "god, and persuade their love to do the same, and educate him into the\r\n",
      "manner and nature of the god as far as they each can; for no feelings of\r\n",
      "envy or jealousy are entertained by them towards their beloved, but they\r\n",
      "do their utmost to create in him the greatest likeness of themselves and\r\n",
      "of the god whom they honour. Thus fair and blissful to the beloved is\r\n",
      "the desire of the inspired lover, and the initiation of which I speak\r\n",
      "into the mysteries of true love, if he be captured by the lover and\r\n",
      "their purpose is effected. Now the beloved is taken captive in the\r\n",
      "following manner:--\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As I said at the beginning of this tale, I divided each soul into\r\n",
      "three--two horses and a charioteer; and one of the horses was good and\r\n",
      "the other bad: the division may remain, but I have not yet explained in\r\n",
      "what the goodness or badness of either consists, and to that I will\r\n",
      "now proceed. The right-hand horse is upright and cleanly made; he has a\r\n",
      "lofty neck and an aquiline nose; his colour is white, and his eyes dark;\r\n",
      "he is a lover of honour and modesty and temperance, and the follower\r\n",
      "of true glory; he needs no touch of the whip, but is guided by word and\r\n",
      "admonition only. The other is a crooked lumbering animal, put together\r\n",
      "anyhow; he has a short thick neck; he is flat-faced and of a dark\r\n",
      "colour, with grey eyes and blood-red complexion (Or with grey and\r\n",
      "blood-shot eyes.); the mate of insolence and pride, shag-eared and deaf,\r\n",
      "hardly yielding to whip and spur. Now when the charioteer beholds the\r\n",
      "vision of love, and has his whole soul warmed through sense, and is full\r\n",
      "of the prickings and ticklings of desire, the obedient steed, then\r\n",
      "as always under the government of shame, refrains from leaping on the\r\n",
      "beloved; but the other, heedless of the pricks and of the blows of\r\n",
      "the whip, plunges and runs away, giving all manner of trouble to his\r\n",
      "companion and the charioteer, whom he forces to approach the beloved and\r\n",
      "to remember the joys of love. They at first indignantly oppose him and\r\n",
      "will not be urged on to do terrible and unlawful deeds; but at last,\r\n",
      "when he persists in plaguing them, they yield and agree to do as he bids\r\n",
      "them. And now they are at the spot and behold the flashing beauty of the\r\n",
      "beloved; which when the charioteer sees, his memory is carried to the\r\n",
      "true beauty, whom he beholds in company with Modesty like an image\r\n",
      "placed upon a holy pedestal. He sees her, but he is afraid and falls\r\n",
      "backwards in adoration, and by his fall is compelled to pull back the\r\n",
      "reins with such violence as to bring both the steeds on their haunches,\r\n",
      "the one willing and unresisting, the unruly one very unwilling; and when\r\n",
      "they have gone back a little, the one is overcome with shame and wonder,\r\n",
      "and his whole soul is bathed in perspiration; the other, when the\r\n",
      "pain is over which the bridle and the fall had given him, having with\r\n",
      "difficulty taken breath, is full of wrath and reproaches, which he\r\n",
      "heaps upon the charioteer and his fellow-steed, for want of courage\r\n",
      "and manhood, declaring that they have been false to their agreement and\r\n",
      "guilty of desertion. Again they refuse, and again he urges them on, and\r\n",
      "will scarce yield to their prayer that he would wait until another time.\r\n",
      "When the appointed hour comes, they make as if they had forgotten, and\r\n",
      "he reminds them, fighting and neighing and dragging them on, until at\r\n",
      "length he on the same thoughts intent, forces them to draw near again.\r\n",
      "And when they are near he stoops his head and puts up his tail, and\r\n",
      "takes the bit in his teeth and pulls shamelessly. Then the charioteer is\r\n",
      "worse off than ever; he falls back like a racer at the barrier, and with\r\n",
      "a still more violent wrench drags the bit out of the teeth of the wild\r\n",
      "steed and covers his abusive tongue and jaws with blood, and forces his\r\n",
      "legs and haunches to the ground and punishes him sorely. And when this\r\n",
      "has happened several times and the villain has ceased from his wanton\r\n",
      "way, he is tamed and humbled, and follows the will of the charioteer,\r\n",
      "and when he sees the beautiful one he is ready to die of fear. And from\r\n",
      "that time forward the soul of the lover follows the beloved in modesty\r\n",
      "and holy fear.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And so the beloved who, like a god, has received every true and loyal\r\n",
      "service from his lover, not in pretence but in reality, being also\r\n",
      "himself of a nature friendly to his admirer, if in former days he\r\n",
      "has blushed to own his passion and turned away his lover, because his\r\n",
      "youthful companions or others slanderously told him that he would be\r\n",
      "disgraced, now as years advance, at the appointed age and time, is led\r\n",
      "to receive him into communion. For fate which has ordained that there\r\n",
      "shall be no friendship among the evil has also ordained that there shall\r\n",
      "ever be friendship among the good. And the beloved when he has received\r\n",
      "him into communion and intimacy, is quite amazed at the good-will of the\r\n",
      "lover; he recognises that the inspired friend is worth all other\r\n",
      "friends or kinsmen; they have nothing of friendship in them worthy to be\r\n",
      "compared with his. And when this feeling continues and he is nearer\r\n",
      "to him and embraces him, in gymnastic exercises and at other times of\r\n",
      "meeting, then the fountain of that stream, which Zeus when he was in\r\n",
      "love with Ganymede named Desire, overflows upon the lover, and some\r\n",
      "enters into his soul, and some when he is filled flows out again; and as\r\n",
      "a breeze or an echo rebounds from the smooth rocks and returns whence it\r\n",
      "came, so does the stream of beauty, passing through the eyes which are\r\n",
      "the windows of the soul, come back to the beautiful one; there arriving\r\n",
      "and quickening the passages of the wings, watering them and inclining\r\n",
      "them to grow, and filling the soul of the beloved also with love. And\r\n",
      "thus he loves, but he knows not what; he does not understand and cannot\r\n",
      "explain his own state; he appears to have caught the infection of\r\n",
      "blindness from another; the lover is his mirror in whom he is beholding\r\n",
      "himself, but he is not aware of this. When he is with the lover, both\r\n",
      "cease from their pain, but when he is away then he longs as he is\r\n",
      "longed for, and has love's image, love for love (Anteros) lodging in his\r\n",
      "breast, which he calls and believes to be not love but friendship only,\r\n",
      "and his desire is as the desire of the other, but weaker; he wants\r\n",
      "to see him, touch him, kiss him, embrace him, and probably not long\r\n",
      "afterwards his desire is accomplished. When they meet, the wanton steed\r\n",
      "of the lover has a word to say to the charioteer; he would like to have\r\n",
      "a little pleasure in return for many pains, but the wanton steed of\r\n",
      "the beloved says not a word, for he is bursting with passion which he\r\n",
      "understands not;--he throws his arms round the lover and embraces him\r\n",
      "as his dearest friend; and, when they are side by side, he is not in a\r\n",
      "state in which he can refuse the lover anything, if he ask him; although\r\n",
      "his fellow-steed and the charioteer oppose him with the arguments\r\n",
      "of shame and reason. After this their happiness depends upon their\r\n",
      "self-control; if the better elements of the mind which lead to order\r\n",
      "and philosophy prevail, then they pass their life here in happiness and\r\n",
      "harmony--masters of themselves and orderly--enslaving the vicious and\r\n",
      "emancipating the virtuous elements of the soul; and when the end comes,\r\n",
      "they are light and winged for flight, having conquered in one of the\r\n",
      "three heavenly or truly Olympian victories; nor can human discipline or\r\n",
      "divine inspiration confer any greater blessing on man than this. If,\r\n",
      "on the other hand, they leave philosophy and lead the lower life of\r\n",
      "ambition, then probably, after wine or in some other careless hour, the\r\n",
      "two wanton animals take the two souls when off their guard and bring\r\n",
      "them together, and they accomplish that desire of their hearts which to\r\n",
      "the many is bliss; and this having once enjoyed they continue to enjoy,\r\n",
      "yet rarely because they have not the approval of the whole soul. They\r\n",
      "too are dear, but not so dear to one another as the others, either at\r\n",
      "the time of their love or afterwards. They consider that they have given\r\n",
      "and taken from each other the most sacred pledges, and they may not\r\n",
      "break them and fall into enmity. At last they pass out of the body,\r\n",
      "unwinged, but eager to soar, and thus obtain no mean reward of love and\r\n",
      "madness. For those who have once begun the heavenward pilgrimage may not\r\n",
      "go down again to darkness and the journey beneath the earth, but they\r\n",
      "live in light always; happy companions in their pilgrimage, and when the\r\n",
      "time comes at which they receive their wings they have the same plumage\r\n",
      "because of their love.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Thus great are the heavenly blessings which the friendship of a lover\r\n",
      "will confer upon you, my youth. Whereas the attachment of the non-lover,\r\n",
      "which is alloyed with a worldly prudence and has worldly and niggardly\r\n",
      "ways of doling out benefits, will breed in your soul those vulgar\r\n",
      "qualities which the populace applaud, will send you bowling round the\r\n",
      "earth during a period of nine thousand years, and leave you a fool in\r\n",

      "And thus, dear Eros, I have made and paid my recantation, as well and as\r\n",
      "fairly as I could; more especially in the matter of the poetical figures\r\n",
      "which I was compelled to use, because Phaedrus would have them. And now\r\n",

      "of the brat, and let us have no more of his progeny; bid him study\r\n",

      "the benefit of them; he enumerated them, and Thamus enquired about\r\n",
      "their several uses, and praised some of them and censured others, as he\r\n",
      "approved or disapproved of them. It would take a long time to repeat all\r\n",
