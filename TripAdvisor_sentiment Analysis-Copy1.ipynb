      "['I always saw the sign along the highway but never stopped, thinking it was just another waterfall. When I finally stopped to see it I was amazed at how rugged and powerful it truly is. Don’t miss this glorious wonder of nature.', \"I very pleasant spot and one that doesn't require much effort to visit.\\nIf you are into photography you might want to time your visit to catch the best light, early morning will mean that you are shooting into the sun.\", \"Can't see much of the fall, and it's kind of small. Also, slipped on the ice and bruised my left elbow, so be careful. Viewpoint was limited.\", 'The Athabasca Falls are just breathtaking in winter!\\nThere is parking just a few hundred meters away so it is safe to go there even when it’s snowing.\\nSnow and ice just made it more pretty!', 'Visited here in late October. The canyon and waterfall were beautiful - a variety of colours, textures. And the surroundings were very quiet. I spent 1 hour walking through the area and enjoying the view.', 'The cliffs and the jagged edges were unbelievable. You good see layers of different times in the rocks. Wow a really good place to see.', 'Food for thought: Go early. We had the unfortunate luck of arriving at the same time as ALL the tour buses... Needless to say there was scarce room to breathe, let alone enjoy the scenery. Nothing against the site in itself, it was just too people-y for me.', 'Simply amazing!\\nPlease go and enjoy nature!\\nIs a must!!\\nBeautiful scenery!!\\nBreath taking.\\nBe ready to walk if you wanna see it all.', 'This falls is about 25 km from Jasper and is worth a visit. A spectacular geological history cab be observed from this area.', 'Absolutely breathtaking. Well worth the drive. Part of the Rockies at their best. Our second trip and would definitely go back again.', \"The Athabasca falls are about 1/2 an hour outside of Jasper - easy to find and not a bad drive to get there. Lots of parking available, trails are well marked, and points of interest clearly identified.Once there, you are immersed in the natural beauty of the area. The falls are surrounded by rock outcroppings that really make you recognize how long this area has existed. There are multiple short trails to follow, each leading to interesting findings at the end. The falls are very impressive, and fast moving. Take a couple of hours to visit this site - you won't be disappointed.\", 'This is a must to visit, great views and an easy drive either in your own car or on an organised tour from the local hotels.Long or short walks to see the views. Ok for fit oldies like my wife and I but could be hard work for some.Wheelchair access would be possible but not for every path, quite a lot of steps and tree roots etc. to negotiate.We took lots of pictures and spectacular scenery.Enjoy this exceptional place!Chris and Helen', 'Athabasca falls was an enjoyable experience. There is plenty of parking, washrooms, and information regarding the falls. The terrain is interesting and there are trails to get to and explore the different sections. The falls are located about 30 minutes or so south of Jasper, very easy to get to with good road signage. They are located just off the main highway. Overall, a fun, pleasant time.', 'The falls are stunning, noisy fast flowing water in beautiful surroundings. The path around the falls is really good as you get different views all around. There is also a path and steps to the bottom of the falls where the water is still and a beatiful green colour, lots of places to take in the scenery and capture photos.Like other places it was quite busy with bus tours when we visited but not over crowded to be able to enjoy the falls and the views.', \"The waterfall is about a 30 minute drive from the Jasper city centre. From the car park it is only a couple of minutes to walk to the waterfall. The trails are well laid out and a bridge takes you to the other side so you can take many photos from various angles. When you cross the bridge don't forget to take the trail to the right as well. This will take you down some stairs through the old Athabasca river and gives you a view of the out flow.\", \"A beautiful walk with amazing sights. A great place to stop and amble through the terrain taking one's time to enjoy great scenery and informative plaques.\", 'Easy to get to and enjoy the thunderous roar, take your time and walk all the way around. Colours are exceptional', 'Wonderful opportunity to go see the falls in the off season! Had an opportunity to go up to Jasper and highly recommend doing it in Oct/Nov when you pretty much have the place to yourself. Views of the Athabasca Falls and the mountains behind it were spectacular. All the mountain peaks were covered from the recent snow, but the ground down below was bare. Only a handful of people were at the falls so it was the perfect opportunity for taking pictures and enjoying the views. Being the off season, there was next to nothing for traffic coming down from Jasper on #93, so you could take your time driving to the Athabasca Falls and back. Really great destination to make for a day trip out of Edmonton and back like I did. Water was amazingly blue and the steps down to the pools below were really cool. Remember to respect the site and to pick up any garbage you bring with you. Keep it beautiful for everyone else to enjoy. :)', \"Hey!These Falls might not be the tallest you've ever seen,or the widest,or the most forceful,but when you tie them in with their location,their backdrop and their history,you must admit they are something special.A photographers dream,do not forget your camera,well worth the visit! Be wary,because they are something else,you,ll probably find yourself in a crowd.\", 'The waterfall is really beautiful and the place offers a really short hike so you can access the Athabasca river for nature photography.

Spectacular view of the falls as is all of the falls in the area. The plus is that there no hike involved.', 'High volume falls where the Athabasca River enters into a narrow canyon. Within a few hundred feet of large parking area near Icefields Parkway. There are several viewing platforms with great views of the falls. This is the best waterfall in Jasper National Park.', 'This place is amazing. The falls and the whole area is simply amazing. My sons uses a wheelchair and this place although they could have made it accessible on most places they did not so it was a bit hard to get around but the it was worth it. I recommend everyone to visit this place', 'Having checked out my list of stops to make on our two day visit to the Icefields Parkway, Athabaska Falls is difinitely at the top of my list. It is a powerful waterfall set on a gorgeous rock shelf. There is a trail and bridge that takes you to the far side of the river and gave even more great views. Not a long stop, but well worth your time.', 'Plenty of water rushing through during melt would but very good and noisy, very pretty around falls, nice gift shop', 'This is a must see! We did all the trails from the one that goes down to the beach below, to the one that leads up to the rapids of the falls. Spent a good 2 hours enjoying the views. An easy hike. Even for us whom arent the hiking type. Dog and family friendly.', 'Visited many waterfalls while I was in the Rockies and as like all the others Athabasca Falls did not disappoint us.Water flow was very high whilst on our visit which made the sound of the river and Falls even more spectacular make sure you visit when you are in the area. Plenty of parking and good walking trails are on offer for you.', 'Athabasca Falls was just one of our tours that our Travel agent organised for us when we visited canada, it was really interesting and lovely scenery well worth a visit', 'These falls are on the route from Banff to Jasper\\nThere are a few routes to take around these falls and you can explore down to the river level on the rocks.

It is definitely worth a stop if you are out this direction.', \"Travelled with Brewsters tours with driver Al.This is one of the best operators I've used. Informative but with plenty of time to explore this truly magnificent place it is one of the must see views.\", \"Unfortunately the falls are full of rude visitors of coaches. Although beautiful be prepared to be pushed and shoved to take a picture. My advice is to walk a bit further past the falls it's quieter and you can still get nice pics.\", 'Beautiful way to see how the whole area comes together from the glaciers to the falls to rivers. Pleasant walk along a safe walkway and great way to take amazing pictures', 'Undeniably the falls are impressive. Because it is usually in the dark it is difficult to take photos of. Also it is on the main tourist coach route, so overrun by tourists.', \"These were by far the most spectacular falls we stopped at whilst in the Rockies. You can't comprehend the amount of water flowing through & the noise is unbelievable. Really easy to wander round, so an easy walk for those less able. Would 100% recommend to anyone that they stop here! Make sure you walk all the way round to have a look from every angle though.\", 'We stopped here on our tour from Jasper to Banff. The falls are beautiful to lok at and the roar of the water is pretty loud. There were not many tourists about when we visited so we had plenty of time to look and take lots of photographs. There are quite a few vantage points located round about and information signs telling you about the falls.', 'What an amazing place to visit . we arrived very early in the morning and it was already packed with people and blooming selfie sticks .The breathtaking beauty made the walk in the cold and crowds worth it though.It always amazes me why people run to get to the front to take a picture ,it is almost as if the water was due to be turned off at 9.30 am :-D', 'Great parking; paths well prepared, and then the falls themselves are just superb, enhanced as everywhere by the emerald colour of the rock silt. Blown away.', 'A must see when you are in the Rockies absolutely stunning. Even my 20 year old nephew was amazed at its beauty', 'If you are in the area you have to stop here. While the photos are nice, being there is even more impressive.', \"Even in the Fall, the falls are amazing- the roar of the water through the narrow channels, turning turquoise green as it flows down river. This is a spiritual place for me.. I love it. Careful when walking- it's slippery, or icy - depending on the season!\", 'Visit Athabasca Falls on our way from Banff to Jasper. The view is amazing.

We were making our way to Lake Louise from Jasper and our friends had planned all our stops. They said we had to see Athabasca Falls. They were right. Quite a spectacular sight.

You have a lot of beautiful country!', 'Nice views with beautiful pristine water. It was well worth the trip. We are glad that we had the chance to enjoy this place', \"A really pretty area. The falls are beautiful but if you want a picture of the falls without all the people who can't read the 'dangerous - do not climb over this fence' signs, you may have to wait a while.\", 'Experience the power of water over time! The glacial water is so beautiful and the rock formations formed over time are beautiful. Definitely worth the stop!', \"I have been there many of times but this time I brought my parents and daughter. It's such a beautiful spot of cysts green/blue water. It's a must stop on your way by and really only takes a good half an hour if you wanna be quick and just look at the main viewing points.\", 'A popular spot for sightseers but they tend to arrive by the coach load.

Allow lots of time here for a good stroll & many different viewing locations & photo ops.', 'Beautiful falls easy to reach from the parking area , fascinating rock structures, amazing blue water', 'Like all waterfalls it was awesome to watch the water cascade down the falls at a point in the year when most of the high up snow has melted can only make you want to visit again in the springtime when the water must go over the falls in torrents. Great to see', \"Well worth the stop and exploring this famous site. The power of the water needs to be seen ( and heard) to be believed. And this was not the falls at full flow. It's been a dry summer. What it must be like at other times of the year.\", 'A visit to the Athabasca Falls is a must see. The barriers make it safe to walk through and the rushing of the water and thunderous noise of the falls makes one feel very close to nature. Not to be missed', 'One of my favourite spots to visit Been there before and quite enjoyed it as last visit one you should visit', 'Beautiful scenery witnessing powerful waterfalls. Great place for picture taking. Good parking area. Can be crowded so beware of times to visit - early morning or late afternoon is probably best, like most places around Jasper.', 'The falls are stunning & really interesting, in the way they are spread around. Very different from other waterfalls we went to. The canyon that the water goes into & through, before emerging into the lake is worth the visit alone.', 'Well worth the short trip from Jasper to see these falls. Enjoy a short hike around the area. It is only 30K (20 miles) from Jasper.', 'As we approach the spot, the mountains and forest welcome us in quietude with swirling water flowing on the plain level. Gradually, as we descend, new dynamics gets revealed between water and rocks. The water cuts through the rocks and falls down in great speed with thunderous noise. With sun on the blue sky, rainbows appear on the spreading particles of bluish white water. The walls of rocks take amazing shapes and colours.

They are loud and awe inspiring. Plenty of different views giving different pictures. The power of the water is amazing in some areas and in others it is flat and peaceful. You can spend a good 30mins just looking at the falls but there are trails to do too. Where the water is still it is a lovely blue/green colour.The walk up to the top of the falls is not flat but with a good pair of shoes and good health you will be fine- it is a proper path.', 'These falls are a must. Very impressive. You can get very close to the top of the falls. You can also take a path to go down to the lower river level. The drive from Jasper along the icefields parkway to the falls is amazing and probably has the most amazing scenery anywhere in the rockies', \"A must see, breathtaking. It's just a short drive from Jasper. The signs are very helpful and it's not that far from the road.\", 'This hike gives you a chance to view the falls from all angles, before walking down the canyon to see where it all empties out into the Athabasca River. Beautiful in any weather. Sturdy footwear is required. Our UK visitors loved this place.', 'If you are looking to see some rushing falls, this is the place to come. The hike is a bit steep, but well worth it. We enjoyed walking the trail to see gully views as well as the falls. You are warned to stay on the path!', \"just an hour's drive from Jasper, Athabasca Falls was a stunning treat. The new parking area at the waterfall made it very accessible and the walk paths were excellent, allowing views next-to and above the falls.

Beautiful falls and you won't forget this one!\", 'Beautiful beautiful beautiful\\nI loved it so much and I think everyone should go and enjoy these falls', 'The falls are only a couple of meters off the main road, so make sure to stop by. The falls themselves are quite impressive, even when rather low on water like now. There are no hiking trails around from what we could tell, so it was a rather short stop for us, 30 minutes tops', 'The Athabasca Falls are between Jasper - Lake Louise on Icefield Parkway and is just a quick stop on the way.The falls are gorgeous and the landscape and scenery around is beautiful.We were lucky to get to see it during a full moon and the landscape was mesmerizing in the moonlight.Worth a stop and spending time here.', 'Free parking, tourists and groomed paths. This stop is your typical waterfall stop but has been well-developed by the park and is very tourist friendly. The wide paths allow for safe and easy walking, railings for safety and occasional seating. User friendly for everyone with a beautiful scenic view of the falls.', \"Turn onto Highway 93A and take in Athabasca Falls - they are gorgeous. Here, the river's milky blue waters funnel into a chasm and break into a creamy plume of white water with Mount Kerkeslin as a backdrop. Usually crowded, but with beauty in nature like this, who cares? Take time to enjoy the nature & go to & view Athabasca Falls.\", 'So many palaces to stop on the Parkway that hard to choose - would definitely include this one if you can. Spectacular!', \"If you are driving south on the Icefields Parkway from Jasper, Athabasca Falls will likely be your first stop, as it is close to the town. It's a pretty but short waterfall.

Clear crystal waters - you get a sense of power', 'Nice stop on the drive to Jasper NP. Gorgeous waterfall, easy access from parking lot, and several viewpoints.

A must-do on any visit to Jasper!', 'Athabasca Falls is located approximately 30 minutes south of the town of Jasper along the scenic Icefields Parkway. It is a place definitely worth stopping and exploring. There were a network of paved pathways leading to various areas overlooking the waterfalls and viewpoints of the deep and narrow canyon. Athabasca Falls was powerful and gorgeous waterfall with a stunning backdrop of forests, mountains and the river flowing through as huge volumes of water rushed down into the canyon. There were a few lookout points offering different views of the falls along the trails. I visited on a sunny afternoon and the area was quite crowded with some of the lookout areas being very small, so I had to wait my turn in order to get up front and take photos. The pathways were interesting to explore and one of them led through a narrow section between two walls of the canyon with stairs carved into the rocks. There were some great vantage points overlooking the river and the canyon to see where the water had eroded the rock to create caves and unique rock formations over many years. Athabasca Falls was a wonderful area to discover, admire the natural beauty and take plenty of photos. The parking lot was large and could accommodate quite a few vehicles. It would probably be best to visit in the morning during the summer season before the crowds of people show up. If you’re driving the Icefields Parkway, definitely stop here.', 'On the way from Banff to Jasper, we stop over at this place for around 30 minutes~ the view is not supreme but worth to a relax short walk during long drive.', \"I give this 4 stars only for the sheer beauty of this place. I'm sure you've all seen famous shots of the falls with a kayaker below (photo credit to Chris Burkard for that one!). The water is dazzling and the short walk down the falls to the river area is picturesque with all the little rock cairns and green forest amidst blue water. However, you are literally elbow to elbow with hundreds of tourists standing in line to get the same photo from one small spot so it felt crowded and overdone. This is NOT a hike-this is a short jaunt along mostly concrete walkways. Although there are some trails that seem to lead to nowhere along the river shore down below. There are some cool stairs carved out of the old river canyon that make a great picture if you get lucky enough that no one is coming up or down it. We had to wait for that moment for about 10 minutes. We were lucky to get some beautiful pictures but were glad to get out of that crowded place and continue on to some less trafficked hikes.\", 'This place only takes about 30 mins to get to from jasper and is so lovely. The waterfall is so powerful at the top and the stream so beautiful at the bottom. Easy and free to park and only a five min walk from the car park', 'If driving the Icefield Parkway you must stop at the Athabaska Falls it should not be missed. The gorge and colour af the water is stunning.h', \"A lovely spot to stop along the highway. There are several fairly short paths that take you to different views. There were a lot of other people there, but it wasn't excessively crowded.\", 'We were so taking by the breath taking views of the Falls itself. How much power the water has. Even a rainbow was sighted for a great photo opportunity. We ate our own picnic lunch therevandvit was quite busy with tourists but we did manage .', 'Athabasca Falls is one of many sights to be taken in on the Icefield Parkway between Lake Louise and Jasper, Alberta, Canada. The blue green silted rivers, the glaciers, the wildlife and the gorgeous views are well worth your time. There are enough stops to keep your kids occupied and enough awe for everyone. A ride well taken.', 'This is a beautiful spot to stop and stretch your legs. Beautiful area, and each step along the pathway provides a unique view.', 'The whole area and not just the falls is beautiful. The water colour is mind blowing and add the curvy shape of the walls from the old water flow will blow your mind. Read the description panels and you will understand.', 'These falls are definitely worth a stopover of 15-30 minutes. You can view them from several angles, and witness the force of the water in the small canyon below.', 'Unlike some waterfalls we stopped at, this one offered a few things you could walk around and see how the water had shaped the rocks around it', 'Athabasca Falls are a lovely attraction, but not very accessible for people with mobility ptoblems as there are stairs and no ramps.', 'There is a large parking lot and the falls are not too far from the parking lot.

Definitely worth the time to take the short hike to see the falls.', 'Definitely a place to visit if you are staying in Jasper. Also within reasonable driving distance from Banff.

There are lots of points from which to take photographs. It is worth stopping here if you are driving from jasper to lake Louise.', 'This was one of many stops on our trip through the Rockies and what a stop it was, we went early in the morning not hoping to see many people but there was already 3 bus loads there, fantastic falls and the sound s were terrific a must when in the area,', \"Athabasca and Sunwapta fall are along the same road fairly close to each other and are must sees. The beautiful blue water cuts through solid rock making for a unique experience.\\nThese are much more developed than the little know Todd's falls.\", 'This is a stop well worth taking on the highway between jasper and the Columbia ice fields . Ample parking and well maintained paths lead you to an amazing waterfall and river walk.', 'Pretty waterfall, pushy visitors. My fellow tourists made this place annoying instead of a place of beauty--packed with people and hard to see!', 'This Falls is amazing and a must see if in the area. Walk all around for different views and photo opps. Glad we stopped to see this; just another amazing sight in the Pacific North West!', \"This stop was worth seeing as we drove the ice fields parkway. We didn't spend too much time here but enough to see the falls and the walk down to the river.\", 'The Banff and Jasper area is filled with canyons like this with water carving deeper and deeper into the rock. I think Johnston and Maligne get more attention but to me, this one was the most beautiful, with the blueness of the water and the colorful canyon walls.', 'Great example of power of water ln sculpting out the landscape well worth a visit on way down from Columbia icefield', 'We almost drove right past but did a u-turn to see what all the fuss is about. So glad we did. This waterfall is absolutely stunning!!!! There is no long hike to get there, it is completely accessible and so worth the stop. You are free to walk along the trail to get different vantage points but the view from the main point is the best. Do not miss this on your way through.', 'Breathtaking. Take a short walk around to see where the falls begin, where they fall into a well, and then speed through narrow canyon walls. Absolutely beautiful.', 'Lovely Water falls to see and hear that roaring water noise , nice natural scenery with canyons. nothing much else to do but must visit', 'Trail was easy and scenic and every step. Many, many vantage points for great photos. Able to see much in a short period of time.', 'Beautiful area. Be sure to walk over the bridge and on the the other side.

Don't drive through Jasper without stopping.\", 'This place was one of our highlights of our trip. We visited them twice on our trip. Beautiful pictures can be taken everwhere. Parking can be iffy as it gets buys even in September. The kids loved watching the water falls.', 'The waterfalls was beautiful, but it was not as impressive as other falls in the area. You had to walk down to the falls to see the pool below the falls or you could view the falls from a bridge a short distance away. I spent a small amount of time viewing and then I was ready to move on to another site.', 'always wanted to visit these falls, to see the view of the falls and the mountain behind them, feel the power of the falling water', \"Thundering falls have carved out an intricate and beautiful canyon.

It was a pity we weren't there in spring when the water levels are more fierce.\", 'Super easy access. Without much walk, you can see the magnificent falls from different angles including up close right by it. One hour is sufficient.', 'Beautiful, the path is well maintained and worth going to see - you can get so close to the falls and the noise is so loud - the water is so blue', \"We had a lot of snow the first I. September and our glacier trip was cancelled due to the length of delayed trips waiting to go, so we went up to the falls, we weren't disappointed they were beautiful.

There were plenty of places to view it and also enjoyed the canyon hike. Be sure to have comfortable hiking shoes on. We thoroughly enjoyed the beauty and power of the falls and took plenty of pictures and some video.', \"Wonderful falls that are awesome to see. We allowed an hour for this stop, on the Icefields Parkway, and used every minute walking all around this fantastic spot. There are warnings about climbing over the barriers, and sad stories of people who have died when they ignored these warnings, so we were stunned to see a guy in his 20's struggling to clamber back over the barrier in a particularly dangerous spot. No photo could be worth this risk!!!!\", 'Very few tourists when we visited. Well maintained steps and paths and plenty of viewing platforms. Powerful falls and canyons worth seeing but not overwhelming if you have seen huka falls in n.z.', \"It was getting near the end of the drive and we were getting a little tired I'm not sure if we wanted to stop. So glad we did as it far exceeded our expectations of the waterfalls. There are easy walks around it and is very picturesque. Tired or not is well worth stopping to see. If you're coming from the north make sure you do it.\", \"One of the most beautiful spots I've seen in this beautiful country of mine!

The force was quite amazing.', 'These falls are awesome and there is a good walking circuit to view these falls from many perspectives.', 'Great area to see, good short walk to the area from the parking area. There is also a restaurant and bathrooms, did not use them but convient. Nice views and places to take pictures, remember your camera or cell phone and it is free.', 'Like almost everything in Jasper/Banff, this natural wonder is breathtaking and amazing, but it extremely overcrowded. Everyone in my party loved the view of this beautiful falls and was frustrated by the excessive amount of tourists, especially those with poor etiquette of which there are many. Steel yourself and go see it.', 'Only 32 min and less than half and hour south of Jasper, Athabasca Falls is a really impressive and photogenic sight. Although the drop of the falls at 23 metres is not particularly impressive, what hits you is the expanse of the river rushing through a small gap at the falls itself. The sound of the water is deafening. The falls is only a short walk from the car park which is just off the Icefields Parkway. There a number of viewing platforms where you can get interesting different views of the massive flow of water. You can also walk down to the bottom of the falls on a good path and view the numerous potholes that have been carved out of the rock by the flow of water.', '“Beautiful, but it can be deadly” The height of the falls isn’t that spectacular, but what draws you to this falls is its sure power. Loud thundering tumbling crushing cascades of water. Carving its way through hard quartzite and softer limestone, you can trace where the water changed courses leaving dry gorges and smooth potholes. This can be a dangerous place. Several people have fallen to their deaths. Do not stray from the paths.', 'These falls are just beautiful and easily accessed. The naturally carved \"stairways\" which the rushing water created over millions of years are now very accessible via a lovely hiking trail and new bridges. There are nice rest room facilities and plentiful free parking as well. You cannot get the full experience and views from the highway or your car. But its also not a difficult walk or trek to see the falls and the eroded rock. We visit Athabaska Falls every time we come to Jasper.', 'Visited Athabasca Falls during our visit to BC.

It has to be seen to appreciate beauty.', 'what a beautiful area and nice walking path to see many different views of the falls. It is worth taking the time to see the entire area.', 'To say that this waterfall is picturesque is an overstatement, but you will be awed by the amount of water from the river upstream gushing though the relatively narrow openings in the rocks. There is so much water that if you can too close to the nearest observation platform, you will be splashed by the fine mist whipped up by the falling water, not to mention the puddle of water collected on the floor usually mixed with mud. Nonetheless, the waterfall is interesting and is worth a visit, but other travellers consider this a must see attraction as well and the place is kind of crowded even when I visited in September.', \"Nice falls. Probably my fave across banff and jasper. Very powerful! Beautiful colours. If you haven't got time for a hike you can just do a fifteen minute walk to see the falls.\", 'This is the way great waterfalls should look. Over the years water has carved a path through solid rock to a great depth.', 'Worth it even if you only have ten minutes to spare but you could spend a lot longer. Pretty crowded though.', 'Falls and rock formations were superb and seen from a path that goes up, down and all over so you get many vistas. Great for photos! If you are into it, you go down to the very bottom as well which is fun, but not really necessary for the spectacularness that the falls are...a MUST SEE.', 'These falls are well worth the stop. The scenery is spectacular. Excellent spots for photographs. Must see if in the area.', \"We stopped,a s does everyone, and whilst the car park was busy we managed to walk around without being in a pack and found that if we lingered the tour bus people rushed round and left pretty soon. A beautiful spot and although this isn't a Niagra experience it is very special and worth visiting.\", 'Definitely worth a visit. The falls are not huge, but the site is beautiful and the paved paths offer many perspectives from both sides of the river for viewing and photos.', 'Absolutely amazing place to visit. Just beautiful. Some falls can be a little underwhelming. Not this one.', 'The trail and the viewpoints are very good. The impressive amount of water can be seen from the may viewpoints. There are sufficient signs where the falls and there surroundings are explained, which makes it worthwile to walk the entire trail.', 'Definitely worth a stop off to view these falls, 30 minutes should cover it all and has some information boards to read. Dont climb over the guard rails as people have fallen in and died from doing so', \"Amazing ! Can't believe how the river has drastically changed course. Live the views as it travels thru canyons\", 'Well worth the drive. 30 min from Jasper. Wonderful views of the falls and you can take steps down to the river.

This is a very beautiful waterfall - well worth stopping for on your travels.', 'The carpark is very near the highway and then equally convenient to the short walk to get to these falls.

Nice walking path with a number of different viewpoints.', 'Worth a camera stop as an intro into the Rockies. Beautiful setting.Convenient parking.\\neasy to observe.', \"I've seen a *lot* of waterfalls in my lifetime. It never gets old, and Athabasca Falls doesn't let you down.There are different types of falls. This one is straight up wild. It has energy. If you want to hike in a ways to see a beautiful waterfall, this one is not for you. This is a tourist stop waterfall. The views are good. Parking is easy. Access is also easy. Wheelchair friendly. Restrooms are primitive, and not the best.\", 'Stunning view from lots of different places. Some spots were for the able body with stairs and over hanging rocks and some views for the less able.', 'We went on a tour of these falls, and really enjoyed being able to get so close to them, and to be able to walk around the falls for maximum photo ops. After some rainfall, we had lots of water to view spilling over the falls.', 'Picture Perfect and breath taking, one of the most amazing Rock formations, Fantastic place to get some great pictures', 'Fantastic waterfalls which need to secured from Japanese tourists trying to take a paddle. They spend so much time taking selfies instead of actually looking at the scenery . I doubt they even turn round .

Close to hotel. Can get crowded', \"I stop here every time I drive the icefeild parkway and I never regret it. The falls are always breathtaking.

It's a great place to visit any time of the year.\", 'Great to take a quick walk and get some photos. Probably gets very bust in summer, car park was nearly full in September. Good to visit en route somewhere', 'The falls here are very strong, decent number of available parking spots on a Wednesday afternoon.

We took lots of pictures....loved the unusual holes made by the rushing water.', 'love these beautiful falls but dont forget to take the fairly short hike down through the carved out rock down to the river it is spectacular !!', 'The Athabasca Falls are a must see for us every time we are in Jasper. The constant changing water levels and colours are beautiful and unique every time we go. If the sun hits it right you can even see a rainbow from the bridge with the water spray!', \"A quick drive out of Jasper to this scenic spot. You don't need a very long time here - less than an hour.\\nDefinitely walk to a few different vantage points for variety in your pics.\", 'I go here often as I live a few short hours away, very relaxing and lots of places to wonder. Free parking and most of the pathways are paved at the top.', 'We saw many waterfalls during our two weeks in the Canadian Rockies but this was one of the most beautiful.

Sunset time adds a multitude of colors for your photos.', \"Athabasca Falls is probably one of the best stops of Athabasca. It's a really power waterfall; probably the second most powerful falls I've seen after Niagara, of course. There's plenty to explore here and you can spend quite a bit of time here if you'd like.Upstream from here, we booked a river rapids tour, which was a lot of fun. It was just class 2 rapids, which weren't bad at all. A couple of us had been on class 3 rapids, so it was pretty gentle for us. Others hadn't been rafting before at all, and so that's why we went with this particular one. There are options to do class three rapids closer to Sunwapta. We got lucky and ended up having our own private boat with just the four of us and a guide. She did a good job explaining the surrounding areas, and of course guiding the raft itself.\", \"I would not say it is a must to do if you are short of time but is definitely worth it. Amazing amounts of water rushing through and carving out rocks. Not crowded but some of the pathway was slippery due to smooth rocks and water from mist. The attraction spreads over both sides of the road and you may miss it if you don't pay attention. Don't forget taking pictures while walking on the steps between layered rock formations. Also do get down to the water level where rushing water ends and wide river flows out it is a nice view from here as well.I may not take more than one hour but it is worth that time.\", 'This waterfall is quite special...not the biggest by a long way buy is one which is very interesting.

Many interpretive signs and ample photo opportunities. Go through quickly or take your time and enjoy the beauty and power of these falls. Spring runoff would be an exciting time to visit. Came in early September so crowds were low.', \"When you can't see the mountains because of the forest fire smoke, focus on the waterfalls. This is one of the two best ones. The shear force and quantity of water is amazing and the canyon that it is carved is absolutely stunning plus you can walk through the old canyons and down to the beach where you see the river become completely calm at the bottom of the falls.\", 'Beautiful day, the falls looked incredible, easy to get to and get around.......great place to have a picnic lunch', \"Athabasca Falls is a pretty cool stop on your way to either Banff/Jasper along the parkway. It's a well manicured walkway which will take about 20-30 minutes and offer different views of the falls. Part of the walk includes stairways through the old path the falls used to take.

Do not miss this as you would regret!', \"If you are prepared for the hoards of others with whom you will be visiting and with waiting in line to take photos at the best photo spots, the actual falls are pretty interesting. Don't forget to hike under the highway to the lower overlook and to the river. There is a very popular photo spot from which many Instagram photos are taken, and it is hard to believe it is under a highway bridge until you've been there.\", 'The Athabasca Falls totally exceeded my expectations! The amount of water, the noise, the terrific photographic opportunity....well worth the time. We were there for about 20 minutes and frankly I could have spent an hour. If you are in the area between Jasper adn Lake Louise, please make time for this: truly wonderful.', 'We took a Brewster Tour of Lakes and Waterfalls. Our first stop was the gorgeous Athabasca Falls. We had a little over an hour at this stop so we were able to hike up close to the falls and take some of the shorter paths to get different vistas of the area. the glacier fed falls gives the water a milky blue look. the water so so cold and yet we were there on a gorgeous July day with the sun and warm temperatures. Make sure you were good hiking shoes, you will want to walk around the area. Lots of free parking. Our tour bus was one of the first to stop in the morning so we were able to get great photos. A must see on a trip to Alberta.', \"A humbling display of nature's ability to use the forces of water, gravity, Venturi & inertia to sculpt rock into beautiful forms over time, sensuous curves & outcropping of stone on which moss & tree still manage to cling & find a foothold. Inspires awe & wonder but also a healthy wholesome amount of fear for those wise enough to heed the park signs to stay away from the edges, respect the fence boundaries & recognize how puny we are in the face of such power.\", 'Lovely place to stop, walk down to the canyon as well as up to the top, they are only short walks and a 30 minute stop gives you time to see it all.', 'Stopped here on our tour it was beautiful, but make sure you wear good walking shoes. There was a gentleman there selling chocolate waffles on the day, with other treats', 'This was one of the must see spots in Jasper National Park we had to visit. This was amazing to see the falls, the canyon area and the beautiful surroundings.This takes about 30 - 45 minutes to truly enjoy. The falls and the accompanying river canyon was a true wonder. This is not too difficult of a walk but hiking shoes or a good pair of supportive shoes is recommended.There is ample free parking, and it does get busy once in awhile due to the tour buses arriving. Even with the amount of people there, we were able to get some nice photos.', 'Just stunning - anyone who did any Physical Geography at school MUST go - really my geography teacher would have been hyperventilating! Was so excited the kids thought it was hilarious and my daughter even considered changing her GCSE options to include geography, and she does like geography. For someone from the UK who thinks High Force or Aira Force Beck is exciting this was mind blowing. You can get really close - we went early morning and on a sunny day - the light on the rock formations and turquoise water is awesome!', \"Take a walk along this beautiful canyon and waterfall. It's a nice walk that I would not miss.\\nDo it and you'll be rewarded.\", 'It was a very warm day when we visited the falls. But the spray from the falls wa refreshing and the sight breathtaking!', 'Athabasca Falls were spectacular and worth the stay in Jasper.\\nMother nature created a wonderful sight.', 'I was able to see the falls last month, then I went to the Alps of Switzerland in August.

I prefered the Sunwapta falls but since Athabasca falls are quite small, do not miss it as well.', \"There are many falls in Alberta Canada and if this is something you enjoy, then you should not miss Athabasca Falls which are beautiful. We didn't get to spend as much time here as I would have liked as I'm sure there was a nice hike/walk we could have done but when there is limited time to do so many things, something has to give.\", 'Athabasca falls located of Route 93A are very beautiful. The glacial water from the Athabasca falls forms the Athabasca river which flows into the Jasper National park and ends up at the Athabasca falls where it fights with the strongest rocks in Jasper to the roaring Athabasca falls. Over time, the falls has changed as in some cases the water has won the fight with the rock and in others where the rock has stopped and channeled the flow of water. For tourists, these days we can walk in these areas. The fall itself is very beautiful and the overall tour is around 30 mins to 1.5 hours.', 'Enjoyable walk and stunning views of the canyon and waterfall. We arrived early and would recommend due to parking issues', 'Aside from being crazy busy with people, this is so beautiful, nice trail to walk on, paved for the main part.

One of my favorite falls.', 'as always, wonderful to see. the best time is close to sun up, fewer tourists so you can take your time and soak it in', 'Well worth the stop ... it will be a sought after and crowded spot for busses and the family photo shoots ...

Easy access, great directional signage, and a natural sight that is almost breathtaking. Well worth the stop and a great photography experience. A must see!!', 'Amazing falls, worth a visit. Good walks around. Avoid the crowds if you can help it. Nearby Edith Cavell pond is also worth a visit but you need a permit!', 'The falls are always worth a stop. Best light is in the afternoon, which also means, more tourists. But the canyon and the stunning landscape are definitely worth it.

First the parking lot is right off the highway and the walk to the falls is very short. The trails are paved and smooth. Seeing these beautiful falls couldn't be easier and more breathtaking.

It is a wonderful, easy to get to, and very impressive little falls.', 'After the Columbia Icefields, stop at the Athabasca Falls. There is a short drive up to a car park which is quite small but has a fairly quick turnover. There are toilets here.A short walk down some steps and an incline brings the visitor to a viewing platform of the falls, which in late spring were still fairly fast flowing. If you have trouble getting down the slope you can still enjoy the falls from the upper viewing area. A pathway leads across a bridge where it is possible to see where the water goes to once it passes the falls. There is a small forest abutting the falls paths which provide some lovely photographs. A nice short break.', 'A must stop off point on highway 93 the ice fields parkway.

Easy walk from the parking lot, good viewpoints created.', 'It was busy being the 150 celebration of Canada but well worth it. The power of water amazes me and I love seeing these mountain canyons. Very short walk around and you can spend a little longer and walk down to the river flats after the falls.', 'This is a crowded area of the park but worth the stop.

We even saw strollers and wheelchairs on the paths.', \"I had high expectations for this stop but, personally, I found that Maligne Canyon more impressive.

Amazing photo opportunities and super easy to get to!', \"Did the Athabasca falls today and I loved it. Shows the sheer force of mother nature.

Pretty crowded but well worth the stop.', \"The falls are spectacular and landscape amazing. We were staying in Jasper and made it a day trip going to Mount Edith Cavell first and then on to Athabasca Falls. Definitely worth the visit. Plenty of parking and it's a nice drive on from Mount Edith Cavell instead of taking the highway.\", \"wonderful day to visit natures beauty. must see easy to get to, just minutes away from Jasper and it's free\", \"Just steps from the main road, don't miss the opportunity to walk to this hidden gem and experience an unexpected but delightful waterfall!\", 'This is a mini Niagara Falls. Fun to explore. Hidden but attracts crowds. Favorite for bus tours. 45 minutes to one hour is plenty to time to allow to see this, depending upon parking.', 'really worth walking down to see the falls views over the hills and mountains are amazing. You can visit this on your way through to Jasper if you are driving', 'Well worth the stop. Beautiful falls with many lookout points. Very short walk to falls with good paved path', \"Views are stunning. It's a waterfall having different colors in different seasons. My visit was summer and the water is like silver white. It's a great visit and worth a drive into it. Highly recommend it if you're in Jasper AB. Location is easy to find too.\", 'The sheer power of the falls and river is breathtaking. The noise makes you sit and take stock of how powerfull mother nature is.', \"Travelers have generally seen many waterfalls, but this one is worth the trip. There is far more water than in many mountain falls and the observation areas are excitingly close to the rushing water. There isn't anything else here, really, except some non-flush washrooms, but this is a memorable stop on a journey.\", 'Must see stop. Take the short walk at the lookout stop. Beautiful views. Get there early. Can be crowded in the summer', 'Not a big fall. Great scenery. close to the road, and worth a stop to see it. Parking is convenient, not a long walk.', 'We spent about a half hour here. Impressive views of the power of water eroding rock the Mist and thunder of the water made a great experience.', 'One of the highlights of our trip. The power of the falls is amazing. Walk to the falls is flat but need to take stairs to see the river below', 'This was our favorite falls along our drive up to Jasper and a beautiful walk along the slot canyons to view the files from different angles was enjoyable.', 'Can get a little busy but a nice waterfall with some good viewpoints, pick the right time of day for the best light', \"Getting to the falls was easy. What wasn't easy was trying to get onto the walkways for a picture. There were so many people. It was right in August when we went to the falls so that is to be expected. The photos you can take are worth the wait for others to move on. There is lots of parking but when we arrived there was only a few spots left. I suggest you go early in the day rather than later afternoon.\", 'Great walk with spectacular scenery. Lots of beautiful photo opportunities along the way. Easy walking.', \"This is literally steps from a very ample car park so it is a popular stop for everyone including tour buses and it's very crowded. This also makes it difficult for photo opportunities as you will always have crowds in your shots but it shouldn't be missed. There are lots of little walks to explore the area and a lot of interesting information for geology buffs. The falls are amazing so you can't blame so many people wanting to view them.\", \"My lady and I share a hobby that takes us to many places, some mundane, some spectacular, and many in between. This resides in the spectacular.We arrived about mid-day and were lucky to find a non-parking lot parking spot. The weather was hot and sunny. Despite the crowds, we were able to see all of the advertised views albeit with some patience. We had been here a few years ago, but it was rainy and cold, and we didn't stay long. This time we stayed about half an hour and were able to take our time seeing everything we wanted to.I definitely recommend this attraction.\", 'A fine waterfall if you are interested in this sort of thing. Easy to access and you get up close and personal with the power of the water. Lots of toilets in the parking area.', \"Athabasca Falls is beautiful, easy to access and worth your time if you are near Jasper. It's much closer to Jasper than the Athabasca Glacier. You will be glad you stopped to see this gem.\", 'Not the tallest falls I have ever seen, but very beautiful sorroundings. Nice pathways leading to the falls. Parking near by.', 'This is a great place to stop and look around. Trails are easy to walk on and views are fantastic We took lots of pictures and saw both upper and lower views.', 'Easily accessible from the car park. Worth stopping off to see. The paths are easy for people with limited mobility to get around. Lots of bus trips seem to stop there.', \"This was very beautiful and it is hard to describe the rush of the water that has carved through the rock over the years. It was fairly crowded but we enjoyed it anyways. As many other sights, this is close to the road and not a long hike to get there. Part of the beauty of the nature at the Canadian rockies. Don't skip it.\", \"Anthabasca Falls are a short 50 ft walk from the parking lot, and very close to 93A and 93 (HWY 1) intersection. Our two girls - 12 and 16, really enjoyed the views. Anthabasca Falls are very impressive, the views are exhilarating, and you can truly admire nature's strength here. Be sure to bring your camera, and snap some pictures, as you walk leisurely for 15-20 minutes (there are many angles where you can capture the falls). Highly Recommended!\", 'When traveling through Jasper Park to Golden we stopped at the falls. It was quite busy that afternoon but we managed to find a parking spot in the large parking area. It was a short paved walk to the falls, wheelchair accessible, and I was able to set up the camera for a couple of good pics. There were clean washrooms on site and it only takes about 30 minutes to capture the essence of the falls. Worth a stop on your trip.', 'On our way from Banff to Jasper (the most picturesque drive we have done so far), we stopped to hike the easy trail to see the falls - there were simply breathtaking! There was a gorgeous view pretty much every turn we made. It was also a dream-come-true for geography buffs - make sure you stop and read the plaques to learn the history of this amazing landscape.', 'As with pretty much all sights in this area walk a little way and you escape the crowds and can be soon on your own. The falls were spectacular. The sheer volume of water and ferocity of them was really quite frightening. A good trip. On way back to Jasper we stopped at Horse Shoe lake which was probably nicer in my opinion. Emerald waters a bit of a clamber in places but deserted. It was stunningly lovely', 'Super easy visit and not a big time commitment. Great vista and video opportunity with the strength of the falls.', 'We made sure that we arrived at the Falls early on the morning to avoid the crowdsThe Falls are very beautiful and we took many photos from the different places around themThe remarkable geology of the area is remarkable and the sound and spray from the Falls with the high mountains behind them and beautiful trees are hard to beat', \"Great stop at the side of the road. Just moments to get to the falls and well worth the stop. Even if you have a husband that doesn't like to stop, make him because you'll all love it!\", 'Beautiful & majestic place to see off Icefield parkway. A 20 min drive from Jasper town. Parking could be limited but you could wait for an available spot as people tends to spend an average of 1/2 hour in this place.', \"Many of the falls visited within the Banff and Jasper National Parks are viewed from the bottom of the falls rather than the top, unless you are happy to hike to the top. Athabasca falls are different in that the walk initially leads you to the top of the falls. It is the sheer volume of water crashing over the falls that makes them spectacular. Go and see them. You won't be disappointed.\", 'Impressive waterfalls, but was really crowded with tourists. One can walk to various levels of the water. Free of charge.', 'We stopped to see the falls on a Cross Canada road trip and were very impressed. We appreciated the picture taking opportunity but more important, we appreciated learning about how the Athabasca river flows to the Arctic Ocean. This attraction is well worth the time to visit—The walk is easy and there are plenty of benches for resting if needed.', 'The falls are a great photo opportunity any time of the year. The amount of water spilling over the falls varies a great deal. Spring, summer and fall pictures will look very different.', \"The waterfalls are beautiful and it's only a very short walk from the parking lot so easy to visit. Nice trip if you still have some time left, you'll be in and out within an hour\", 'Worth a stop to check out these falling. Lots of people as you would expect but you can take different path to get some peace and quiet', \"This waterfall was deceiving. It didn't look like much until you got up to the actual fall lookout. Once there, they were much more impressive.\", 'The falls and surrounding scenery are beautiful, but be prepared for the walk up the trail. Wear athletic shoes with good tread, and if you have walking poles you should bring them. It is crowded in August.', 'Absolutely stunning place to stop off. Go down to the river too and get some amazing pics on the rocks', 'One of the coolest sights on the way from Banff to Jasper. Very beautiful! One of the best photo spots on our trip.', \"Another outstanding feature of the Jasper/Banff glory. But it can get really crowded, parking isn't easy and the viewing area is small.\", \"It's like a miniature of Niagara falls. Plenty places to take pictures.\\nIt's not too far from Jasper.\", 'The falls, like the rest of Canada were fabulous. Not as big as I imagined but amazing nonetheless. Short enough walk to get to the falls so would definitely recommend as a stop off point!', 'Easy to get to, and worth the stop. Views were amazing. I would suggest anyone travelling to make the stop.', 'We were on a mission to see Wells Gray Provencal Park, Banff NP, Jasper and Glacier NP . While Glacier NP has a special place in memories Jasper NP is trully a diamond! Loved the Northern most part of the park and Athabasca Falls was amazing.', 'Went here as partbof a bus tour. Just another waterfall. Worth a look but the crowds are ridiculous. You have to push through the crowds to get a photo. Would be ok if not too crowded.', \"You don't go there expecting big waterfalls, but for seeing the natural beauties along Icefields Parkway and it is certainly worth visiting.\", 'Very scenic. Take the time to explore the whole area and get an idea of how this area has evolved over time. Great photo ops. WATCH YOUR CHILDREN', 'This was an easy to walk trail but absolutely stunning! Very unusual rock formations with the rushing water! Highly recommend!', 'This is a must see for every family vacation! You can easily spend an hour here. Absolutely beautiful place.', 'The falls were amazing and with the bridge that goes over it you can see it from many angles. Well worth the visit. About a 20-30 minute drive from downtown Japer. Get there early as it is popular and parking is limited. We arrived at 11:00 am an got one of the last few spaces although people are coming and going all day.', 'The beauty of these falls is amazing, especially if you had the opportunity to go rafting on another portion of this river...', \"If you want to be close up to a water fall this is the place,you can see it from every angle and when the sun is out the rain bows are fantastic.We have some great videos,warning you can get wet as well but that's the fun that comes with the trip.\", \"We traveled from Lake Louise to Jasper National Park on day 6 of our Tauck Tour of the Canadian Rockies and our guide Rob had us stop & visit the Magnificent Ahabasca Falls. They were absolutely spectacular with waterfalls & beauty abound! A must visit to this Magnificent site! Don't miss it!??\", 'Took the 93A and arrived at the back entrance and wandered around all the viewpoints that allowed you to view the torrent of water pouring through these small gaps in the rock! Nicely done walkways, bridge, viewing points, access canyons along old water courses to view from different angles! Enjoyed being so close to power of the river and nature!', \"Great visit. Lovely views. Well wothe stop and the short walk to the falls. Very popular of course so there was a bit of jostling with the crowds. But this didn't detract from the visit. Highly recommend.\", \"They said it's the largest fall in Jasper/Banff area. It's right beside 93A, convenient. Just stop and take some picture, then leave. Definitely worthwhile to go.\", 'Enjoyed in the morning on our way from Jasper to Columbia Icefields. little chilly in the cloudy morning.', 'A lovely walk that took a little under an hour (with a lot of stops to appreciate the views and take photos). The power and beauty of the Falls and the tranquility of the river beyond it were incredible. There were quite a few people there, but it did not feel crowded because there were so many viewpoints. I would recommend going down to the beach area beside the river, even though the steps are steep. There were some interesting information boards around the pathways and the option to walk further through the woods. Would not recommend the toilets - they are long drops, were filthy and really stank!', 'What an unreal place - like being inside a picture postcard. Several places you can walk to and get great views of the falls!', 'Great waterfall. This was our third visit and we have enjoyed it each time. The power of the river is impressive as it courses down the falls.', 'A must when you are in the area. The sound and the beauty of these falls are carved in stones. Few from several vantage points to get the full effect of glacier melts.', 'This location has easy access to a remarkable falls where one can walk across a bridge over the Falls and see down into the area below. The path on the other side of the bridge allows you to see the upper area rapids before the Falls and the lower area of the Falls, It also has a walking trail on both sides of the Falls. It is very safe to view and hearing the sound of the Falls is a treat as well. It is really worth the stop to see and I am sure you will get some great pictures for your album.', 'These falls do not have a huge vertical drop, but you see the power of the water at work and the walls of the canyons are beautiful. The toppers are the signs. They are written with a verve you rarely see at parks and recount the dangers of the falls and the constant war between water and rock. One of the best stops on the Icefields Parkway.', \"Athabasca Falls should be on your list of places to visit in the Icefields-Jasper area. Short walk from parking and you get close to the water. There are several hikes available around this area and it's common to see a rainbow around the water falls.\", 'Worth the visit. Definitely photo worthy.\\nNot all of the site is disabled accessible (even the main parts).', 'This is really cool. The fencing keeps you a little too far away but there are multiple viewing spots. Like most of the really neat things to see, parking is limited and its not setup to handle a lot of people. Didnt see any parks staff either. Still you shouldnt miss itI even got a cool shot with a rainbow', 'Not quite Niagara but still worth a visit. Easy to walk around and you can go to a further viewing point if you want. Good restaurant and gift shop.', 'You can just sit there and marvel at the amount of water from this big river getting funneled into this little neck. Sad reading about all the idiots who got too close and fell in and died. Beautiful spot', 'Easy access we just parked side of road and walked to bridge. Beautiful spot to stop and appreciate mother nature.', 'Not to far out of Jasper is the perfect spot to go for a short hike and amazing views. Recommend going first thing in the morning before it gets too busy with tour buses.', 'The easiest and most convenient attraction to hit during a week in Alberta. Not far from parking and no hills, paved paths, and just lovely.', 'This is a beautiful little hike to visit the Falls which are wonderful to experience. We shared the experience with our friends and took lots of pictures.', \"This place is a must to visit if you are in the area. The falls and views are simply breathtaking and spectacular. Worth walking out to some of the more distant viewing platforms to see the falls - you won't be disappointed. I'll remember the views for a long time to come.\", \"Highly recommend going to Athabasca Falls when visiting either Banff or Jasper. It's free, plenty of parking and lots of great vistas to enjoy for solo, couples or families. Great for photos.\", \"A powerful waterfall that has great viewpoints near the parking lot. This isn't a hike but rather a pull off to check out. It's worth a visit if you have some time to kill.\", 'Surprised at how close you can get to this relatively small but nonetheless beautiful and powerful fall. The fall can be viwed from both sides and from above. Impressed by the way these various aspects are managed via fencing and signage. Apparently there are serious accidents and deaths when people have ignored these.', 'We did a quick stop at the Athabasca falls on our way south. Although it can be busy it is worth the stop. The falls are spectacular.\\nIt is easy to get around and the place is well maintained.', \"This is an easy stop along the way and worth 20-30 minutes. It won't be peaceful - there are lots and lots of people at this spot, but the falls are spectacular.\", 'Can be a bit crowed when the bus tours come in but worth the visit. There are washrooms in the park lot which can be handy. Take a jacket as the spray from the falls can make it a little cool even on a hot day.', 'Great view of the falls, quite busy so best to go early in the day or late in the day, good place to stop, eat lunch and enjoy the view down by the water', 'A bit of a honeypot but well worth the easy walk. The falls are just amazing. Safe due to good paths and fences.', \"A great 10 minute stop to stretch your legs. It is a gorgeous place, but don't expect tranquility - Because it involves very little walking, tour buses are unloading here all day so the crowds take away some of the natural beauty of the place. In the summer time, don't expect to get a parking space between 12pm-5pm. Aim to go early in the morning or at sunset.\", 'These waterfalls were truly a memorable part of our journey to Jasper, with multiple streams and a beautiful picture-postcard view. Keep in mind it is a very busy attraction and thus very popular with tourists so be prepared to squish in among a crowd if attending during popular times! Note there are several vantage viewpoints to see the falls.For the absolute best pictures with your digital camera, figure out how to set a longer shutter speed. Between 0.25 to 0.5 second generally gives me the best results. Generally speaking, the slower the waterfalls, the longer shutter speed should be to give the nice soft effect of water movement. With very aggressive falls, shorten your shutter speed; in some cases where the flow is very aggressive, it will show up all white, so bear that in mind.Please kindly indicate if you found this review to be helpful as it will allow me to better focus my future efforts! Much appreciated - hope you have a great time and safe travels!', 'Six adults and two young children hiked around the well marked trails to view the awesome falls. The trails are safe and designed for people with a variety of abilities. Lots of parking spots were available as well as bathrooms.', 'This was a super crowded venue that was less impressive than expected. We would recommend continuing further into Jasper to Maligne Canyon! So amazing!', 'Just a short walk from parking lot to this awesome sight! You need only a short stop but so worth it! Spectacular!', 'Definitely worth a stop! Very crowded - best to visit early or late in the day. Many great views of the falls. Allow 30 min.', 'Nothing ruins a great day in nature like 500 people fighting for the same parking spot. The falls themselves were incredibly powerful. There are paved paths to get you from the parking lot ( or road) to and around the falls. No hills to climb, lots of guard rails and warning signs - not that common sense is in short supply. Many huge rock formations and overhangs in the falls that make for great pictures. Expect to line up to get the shot you want. Too many people in a small place for me. But you should still stop here', 'A short trail walk to the falls. Hard to imagine all that water going over the falls.\\nGo early to get good photos by yourself', 'This is a beautiful setting and a scenic place to stop. The falls are in more of a canyon, so overlooks are small and very overcrowded. Worth the stop, just be prepared during high season.', \"This falls is beautiful and worth the short hike. It is very crowded, but that doesn't seem to detract from the beauty.\", 'Athabaska Falls is a wonderful nearby attraction from Jasper, Alberta. We are glad we stopped by and explore the trails which offered even better views of the falls. Definitely well worth the stop.', 'These are a wonderful set of falls, with tremendous views. But it can get very crowded. Try to get there early (before 11:00), and before the numerous bus tours arrive. Well worth a visit.', 'Apart from the sheer physical majesty of the place it is so well signed and explained by the information on site that one cannot help but be impressed. This is why I came to Canada. It is so much more than \"ahsum\".', 'One must stop and view the falls...no matter how limited on time. It is not only beautiful, but also a wonderful example of the pure power of nature. If one is a photographer there are many locations to take that \"one shot\" of the trip. If you are a hiker, there are plenty of footpaths that allow one to meander among the woods and river/falls. The best locations for viewing are, understandably, crowded. However, people seems to recognize that everyone would like to have that special \"vantage\" point view and are courteous with their time at those locations. Small childres should not be left unattended or unsupervised, however. There are locations along the trails where one might get too close to the waters and could potentially slip and fall. That said, it is too beautiful and powerful to miss.', 'Pretty incredible sight. Great trails to walk down and see all there is. Take lots of pictures, walk down to the ricer and put your feet in the cold water.', 'Athabasca Falls are a great stop between Jasper and Banff. If you are not a hiker, but want to enjoy beautiful falls this is the perfect place to go. There are walkways all around the area, scenic views, and nice photo opportunities. It is busy in July and August, but still a quick and easy way to close to beautiful falls.', \"Stopped of here as a part of our tour and they were a great sight part of Canada's wonderfully scenery.\", 'This is the second time that I have been to Athabasca Falls and I could hardly wait to show my Husband and friends what I had seen before. The Wow factor of these falls just takes your breath away, I would recommend that anyone that is in the area to stop by and see this beautiful Gem.', 'The falls were gorgeous and an easy walk to get to in order to see. One of the best falls to see in Jasper National Park', 'We made a quick stop in the afternoon at Athabasca Falls. The falls are close to the parking area. The falls have cut a very interesting rock formation.', 'Athabasca Falls offers a beautiful view of the falls and an adjoining canyon. This is a busy spot so it is best to go early in the morning or later in the day. This is a great spot for photos, offering good views of the mountains as well.', 'Excellent walkways and scenic spots to capture the beauty of the falls. Signage provides explanations about the falls.', 'This is an easy to reach waterfall which has many different viewpoints for photos. It is huge and powerful - compared to any other falls we saw in Banff and Jasper National Parks. A must-see.', 'Roaring churning intensely powerful falls. A good walkway through. Worth a stop.\\nThere are steps, may not be ideal for wheelchair users.', 'The force of the water as it thunders down is really quite amazing.\\nFollow the walkway to the various vantage points in order to appreciate how the water has carved into the rock.\\nInformation boards tell the story.', \"Nice small walk with lots of info on the falls and paved paths. Just like other waterfalls it was just a lot of white water flowing over rock!! It is interesting though seeing the formations in the rock, imagining how hard the water hits the rocks. It's is a nice quick thing to do, not something you'd want to run into while kayaking!!\", 'This was a very cool waterfall and more unique than traditional falls. There is a well paved walkway with three look outs. Can be a bit crowded... but this is a must see. There are some non crowded trails that run behind the falls that may be worth a look.', \"Athabasca Falls are always beautiful to visit. The scenery, the power of the water, the deep, abandoned channels, the cool spray on a hot day ... the only thing that detracts from all this are the hoards of people. Feels like Disneyland at Christmas time! Wouldn't be so bad if there weren't so many stupid, oblivious people who think they are the only ones on the planet! But I digress (because there are those people everywhere). Given that, I would still highly recommend visiting the Falls - a not-to-be-missed sight along the stunning Icefields Parkway.\", 'We visited Athabasca Falls in early July 2017 - beautiful falls with multiple viewpoints; You could do a half-a-day trip from Jasper or do a pit-stop on Icefields Parkway prior to arriving into Jasper (Assuming you are driving from Banff)', 'Simply beyond words, a must see. Beautiful and stunning waterfalls. Let nature speak to you. Go as early as you before crowds arrive.', 'When driving to Jasper along the Glacier Parkway you pass the falls so may as well stop and have a look. Good views and only a short walk from the car park. Longer walks if you want them. Good photo opportunities.', 'Easy to get to from the parking lot but equally as interesting drive to get to the falls off of the main highway. We had not seen many animals prior to this particular day and we saw 4 bears driving along 93A!', 'The amount of water is truly impressive. There are a variety of areas to walk around and get different views of the falls and surroundings. Take your time and explore a bit to see the other elements of the landscape.', \"This is an old park that is not well maintained, but the falls are outstanding. It's amazing how water can carve through stone.\", \"An amazing display of God's majesty. Some steps to maneuver, but a very well constructed walk.

This can be a super short visit (we were only there 10 - 15 minutes), or you could bring a picnic and explore a bit more. Highly recommended!', 'Awesome waterfall with easy access. There are some stairs but it is worth the time. You will need about 30-45 minutes if you want to stop at every view point on the trail. Not very busy when we arrived late afternoon!', 'This was quite an amazing visit. You witness the power of the water and how it erodes the rock. Take the time to walk down to the bridges, it is well worth doing. Stunning views.', \"This was a 'chance' stop on the highway - that I'm so glad I made. It was beautiful - and the information about the origins and the flow of the Falls was wonderful.\", 'Stunning falls. Would thoroughly recommend that you walk all the way down to the 5th bridge. Its not too tough. The signage is a bit confusing. But its quite simple. Follow \"7\" down to 5th bridge and then follow \"7f\" back to the car pArk. Enjoy!', 'We travelled from Jasper to Banff and stopped to see the Athabasca Falls. It is a short drive from Jasper. The falls in summer are spectacular. Rushing water into a canyon. powerful falls.

It was nice to see the falls from several different locations and to go to the bottom and walk into the water.

It was very crowded as there was a tour bus there at the same time as us. We walked along the paths and when we got back to the falls they had gone so it was much more pleasant to see. Definitely worth seeing.', 'Enjoy the vista of the water running and swirling as it passes thru crevices in rocks bouncing off walls.', \"The stunning aquamarine water rushing and tumbling into the river gorge is a glorious sight.

Very easy and short walk down to the falls which are spectacular. Beautiful forest surrounding the falls too.', 'Good to visit. 30 minutes required at most.

Parking is a bit hectic as it seems like on the road is the only option, however there is an off-road area, so look for that.', 'There are so many other places to go, waterfalls to see, hiking options ... Athabasca Falls seems designed for tourists who want to walk a couple of steps, take a photo and leave.

Well worth the time! It's a very short drive off the parkway to a large parking lot w/ plenty of washrooms. You can hear the falls well before you can see them. We've visited Niagara falls a few times and of course they aren't as that tall but what makes Athabasca so special is how close you can get to them to feel the mist and of course, the beautiful mountains behind them. Depending on what time of day you're there, you can catch a rainbow in the mist. We love it there.\", 'A waterfall with many walks in the surrounding area and also river rafts below falls. Good facilities in car park. Falls are impressive and thunderous and you may catch a rainbow in the spray from the waters.', \"Our friends took my wife and I to Athabasca Falls.

The view is spectacular and the formation of the rocks and water is breath taking. It is an easy walk through the first fall but I understand you can spend quite a while if you want to see them all. Take care with the smooth surface of rocks when you walk. It can be quite slippery.', 'These impressive waterfalls are not too far from the car park (for a young child who was with us). Although reasonably short in height, the falls had terrific volumes on the day we visited, creating good spray and noise. The really good things is that the water continues down through a canyon cut out by the water over ages, and continues to impress as it heads downwards. Well worth a visit!', 'These fall were great for a quick stop between Jasper and the Icefields. We whitewater rafted from the bottom of the falls the day before, so it was nice to see the view from the top!', 'Only a short distance off the highway. Breathtaking falls through narrow cuts in rock with many scenic overlooks.', \"Saw pics online and couldn't wait to see for myself. Sort of a 'canned' experience, with trails that are paved, giving the feeling of being at a theme park.\", 'The river has cut down 60 feet or so through the limestone. the signs warn you about the dangers of approaching the edge and the gorge is steep and the waters rush though, worth seeing.', \"As you are starting toward the Columbia Ice Field from Jasper, don't miss these beautiful falls.

For maximum effect take a video with the roar of the falls complimenting their wonder\", 'A short walk from the parking lot brought you right to the falls.\\nStopped here on way back rom Mt. Edith Cavel', 'Beautiful falls just off the road but very crowded. Saw a rainbow! Easy paths to walk and see the falls from every angle. No services. Lovely', 'Easy to do from the road, can be a quick stop. Definitely worth stopping for between Lake Lousie and Jasper', 'A must see except during low water in autumn and winter. The waterfall, slot canyon and the mountain beyond is quite photogenic. Be ready for major crowds.', 'The Falls were easily accessed from highway 93 or 93A.It was a spectacular sight. We first saw the upper part with roaring white currents. The resulting mist was cold and refreshing. We followed the trail to the lower section where there was no water. The pothole showed the power of water carving the rock. The river was a starting point for whitewater rafting. Along with snow mountains in the distance, spruce trees along the river, the view was breathtaking.', \"We've seen Athabasca Falls countless times, as we show it to every visitor who visits us in Canada. Every time it's different, especially the beach by the river. This time the water was so high that there was hardly any beach visible. One time the beach was filled with inukshuks that people built out of the stones on the beach. It's always gorgeous.\", \"By the time we visited Athabasca Falls, it's the 5th day of our trip to Banff/Jasper. The excitement to see amazing color of the lake/falls was wearing thin, but this fall is still very much worth seeing. There is a little walkway and viewing platform for you to have better view (if you don't mind getting wet). I have been to a few places (Iceland for one) and this fall is def. one of the best.\", 'The power of water is unimaginable! But you can see it at work in Athabasca Falls. There is a fairly easy walk featuring various viewpoints and features of the falls.

This place is just full of foreign tourists which makes it extremely difficult to navigate and get around. We did enjoy the sights and taking pictures and there is lots of parking.', 'A great trail for stretching your legs, and taking in some beautiful sights. The trail is well maintained with several viewing areas. Can really get crowed with tourist, but well worth seeing.', 'Not tall, but powerfull and beautiful waterfall. It is worth the stop for sure. Easily accessible for older folks.', 'This was one of our last stops on our road trip that day from Lake Louise to Jasper, but well worth stopping for. Its a large and powerful waterfall which you can see from many angles and can get very close to. The old gorge with steep steps is also very impressive and the views at the bottom are stunning. Definitely a must see place', 'one of several falls/canyons in the Canadian Rockies that must be near the top of most must-see lists. it was not too much walking and lots of nice views. the information boards were good and the path was in pretty decent shape.', \"We drove the whole way from Banff to Hinton in a day, and we saw a LOT, but Athabasca falls really stands out as the top attraction. I've seen a lot of waterfalls, from Niagara to the Lower Falls of the Yellowstone and many others. This is truly one of my favorites.\", 'Beautiful falls, easy to find and an easy walk to see the falls. Several different walk options, from very short (200m) to longer walks if the mood strikes. Recommend stopping in to see.', 'Quite a nice short experience. Lovely falls and good education on its history. Good location for picks and a stop to break the drive from Jasper to Banff.

The power of water is nature.', 'We stopped here with a tour group. The falls are so pretty and I loved the sound of the rushing water. I did a little video of it on my phone so I could always listen to it.

Take the easy walk around the falls to appreciate its beauty.\\nCheers - Jules', 'Gorgeous waterfall, awesome hike..i am running out of adjectives to use for attractions at banff and jasper NP!', 'Beautiful waterfall with very strong water force. There are several areas for viewing and Lots of great pictures to take here. Very scenic.', 'This is a great place to get out of the car to stretch your legs on your way into Jasper. The falls are quite impressive. To see what the force of water can do over the years is truly amazing. There are stairs to walk and some inclines. But if you are mobile, you will enjoy this stop. Allow between 15 and 30 mins. Depending on how much you want to see.', \"Due to being Canada's 150 and all the National Parks are free, it is extremely busy. If you want some great photos without people shoulder barging you, I reccomend not going at the peak times. If you're heading to Banff or Jasper I would say that this is a must see along the way!\", 'Nice falls - lots of geological history. Can be somewhat crowded but not too much so. Raft trips can be seen below the falls in the river', 'Stop and see for sure! Short walk from parking. One of the best waterfalls anywhere. Short drive from Jasper.', 'Beautiful falls. They are a must visit! Go early in the morning to avoid crowds. Nice walks along the river and the road leads back to the ski hill.', \"This can be said for just about any of the stunning places along the Icefields Parkway between Jasper and Banff on a holiday weekend in July, but it was just too crowded. Still it is an amazing place. I prefer to hike the extra miles to get away from the crowds, but it's still worth stopping in to see.\", 'It was a busy warm weekend, and the side trip to see the falls, is always worth it!. Not to hard of a walk and the view is always amazing! Parking was no issue, many bathrooms, short walk, and I suggest prior to 10:00 am before the crowd saturates the view points. Please stay on the trail, it is frustrating to see visitors not follow the rules, and please use the garbage cans, keep our parks system pristine for the next generation to enjoy!', \"Highly recommend! Easy walk and so pretty! Getting there early is always good to enjoy it. It does get busy and you'll want to enjoy it.\", 'The falls are absolutely stunning. It was a bit crowded so I would advise going in the morning. So worth it!', \"Gorgeous falls. Don't miss this! It is worth every minute you spend there. Awesome site to visit but be careful with children\", 'Maybe not the same scale as Johnston and Maligne Cantons, but easier accessibility and still beautiful!', 'The falls are easily accessible, off the highway and near the parking lot. We were lucky enough to catch a rainbow during the time which made the falls even more spectacular. The site is a main tourists spot with many buses making the rounds. Go there early if you are looking for less crowds', 'Easily manageable for most people. Not wheelchair accessible. Quite dramatic picture ops! Busy place in July.', 'Unbelievably spectacular waterfall in beautiful setting. Well worth the time to see this, but be careful not to fall in and kill yourself.', 'I was pleasantly surprised by what a nice falls this was. It was also made better by being able to completely go around it. The park service had done a great job of providing a viewing path allowed for so many angles of this beautiful falls.', \"Great place to stop. Very small area when it's busy. Very good road and washroom facilities. A great shop to take a look very friendly staff.\", 'The falls actually twists and turn almost like canyon. For photo to capture the whole falls from top to bottom is difficult and a wide angle lens wider than 12 mm is needed.', 'If you are on highway 93 between Jasper and Lake Louise you gotta make time for these falls. Easy parking of the road, no hiking if you want a easy activity and we went at 8.30pm and it was quite and lovely in low evening sun.', 'A quick stop along the way. It was hard to appreciate the beauty given the high volume of people. If you park along 93a you can avoid most of the trail by walking immediately to the main bridge to view falls. You can escape just as easily to avoid walking in the crowds.', 'Breathtaking.AmazingPower of the water is surrealThe entire icefields parkway ride has so many stop offs and viewing sites and natural wonders. Please do not plan your vacation short just to avoid a hotel stay. We enjoyed the ride from Banff and enjoyed the ride greater when we returned from Jasper. Thank you to our Canadian neighbors.', 'Love these falls. Have stopped here twice. Always amazing. Plenty of parking. Even parking for our Airstream! Worth about a half hour or more', 'Pictures do not do this place justice. The volume of water and the sound it makes is unbelievable. There is a boardwalk for you to follow where there are amazing picture opportunities.\\nWell worth the visit.', 'The falls are right off the highway and are beautiful. They are well worth stop. There is minimal walking to the falls.', 'We spent a couple of hours here later in the evening, and there was no crowd at all. The falls are beautiful but so is the canyon. Definitely worth a stop.', 'You must hike the 2.5 mile round trip to the bottom of the falls. So beautiful. You can see how powerful the falls can be.', \"This was our last stop driving from Calgary to Jasper so it had been a long day already - but worth a stop since it is a quick walk from the parking lot. Photos really don't do it justice so just stop and appreciate the roaring sound of the water the mist in your face and the natural beauty of the blue water.\", \"So much water flows wildly through this section of the river it makes for an amazing site and waterfall. Walk the trails, stay a while and listen to the thunderous roar of the water, look out for the local wildlife and get lost in its beauty. If I lived in this area I'd come over and over again just to experience this natural ruggedness and beauty of this place.\", 'If you drive through there make a stop- Its a nice Fall but very crouwded- better Visit wells grey Park, all 4 Main falls are\\nMore spectacular and less crowded', 'Waterfall plus mountains equals absolutely beautiful. Falls are right off the parkway. Great place to get out and stretch your legs on the drive between Banff and Jasper.', \"Definitely don't miss this stop. I've visited quite a few falls in BC and these ones rank as some of the best I've seen... mainly because the public is able to so close to these.\", 'This was one of the easier walks to the fast moving water and falls. all the pathways safe to walk on. Being there in June the water was flowing very swift and beautiful to see!', \"Get up close and personal with these falls. There is a very short walk to the Falls area and then you can take another walk down into a canyon area to see where the falls continue down the river. There are stairs down this area and you don't want to miss it if you can handle stairs. The powerful river is amazing. To see how the water has cut through the rock over the years is a sight to behold. Don't miss!!!\", 'Do not miss this site -- an easy walk from the parking area immediately immerses you in the beauty, sights, and sounds of rushing water.', \"Easy to get to, practically next to the parking lot, a bit busy with tourist buses. I've seen a lot of waterfalls, this one is nice, above average. Because it is quick and easy to see and you are in the area, definitely should stop by.\", 'Stopped here on our way to Jasper. Great stop. Beautiful falls, able to walk around and go down to the bottom of the falls to a rocky beach area where you can climb around near the water. Some people took off their shoes and were in the water. There is also a walking path to view the falls closer up as well as other other trails. Good stop to get out, walk around, and take in beautiful views. Definitely recommend!', \"Absolutely beautiful, the tumbling water really pulls you in. But when you look at the bigger picture how the water has cut through the rocks over thousands of years it's mind blowing. I'd love to show pictures and a video but Trip app won't pick up on my photos. Sorry you should visit you won't be disappointed.\", \"These falls are not spectacular in height but in the simple process of forcing an enormous amount of water through a very tight opening, they are an awe inspiring demonstration of the power of nature.Access is easy, just off the Icefields Parkway and parking was busy on the day we visited but there was frequent turnover. The walk to the falls was easy. There are plenty of viewing spots so don't stress if the first few ones are clogged by selfie takers - the spots further on are better!The short walk down to the lake is worthwhile to see the geology that contributes to this spectacle.As a footnote, there are many signs to stay within the fenced areas, which seems obvious given the power of the falls, strong currents leading to them, freezing temperature of the water and slippery rocks. Nevertheless, there were also signs that someone dies every couple of years by disobeying these signs and memorial benches dedicated to them.\", 'On a coach tour, this is usually just a short stop on the way to or from Jasper. It would be worth much more, because it is a true wonder of nature. The water is cascading down on the rocks with great power and provide you with a magnificent view. There are several footbridges and well paved paths over and along the torerential, white water stream. It rushes through narrow and deep canyons, giving the visitors endless photo opportunities. The paths are good enough (at least at most parts)for wheelchair access, although if I recall it rightly, there are sections which can only be negotiated through steps. A great experience, not to be missed!', 'Fantastic views, spent a couple of hours walking round the falls.\\nSpectactular. It was a very hot day, but the water from the falls was cool and rereshing.', \"We were driving past on our way to Jasper and saw lots of other cars turn off the road. We followed out of curiosity and really enjoyed an unanticipated, short wander round this interesting spot. The waterfalls are the star of course but the rock formations are interesting too. We'll worth a 30 minute stopover.\", 'Short stop off main road Jasper National park.\\nBeautiful falls demonstrate the power water. Parking is limited.', 'We visited the falls with friends, lovely views etc. But I found it very frustrating for I have a knee problem and had to give up for there was many steps and slopes to undertake.', 'This is a must visit. It is only a couple of minutes off the main road, parking is free. The falls are reached by boardwalks and is suitable for all ages. Even in the heat of the day you are cool because of the water and overhanging trees.', \"After seeing many falls in our visit to Banff and Jasper National Parks, I wasn't sure about seeing another. However a friend had recommended we go so we did. Thrilled we didn't skip this breathtaking falls. Definitely worth a visit. Good for families with kids of all ages.\", 'The Athabasca Fall is just off the highway and a wonderful site to see. It is very easy to walk around the Falls the site is jaw dropping amazing. One of our favorite site on our 10-day trip to Alberta.', \"We had lots of little kids with us and the fall's path were short and stroller friend. Not as busy as Maligne canyon.\", 'Stop on a whim and was pleasantly surprised. Short walk to falls that were very picturesque. Offered to take pictures for visitors.', \"I'm sure it's great early in the morning but it was packed when we went at 5:30pm\\nI would recommend Mistaya canyon instead\", 'We have seen quite a few water falls on this trip but this was the best to date. Spill off from glaciers high in the mountains cascades down at a fantastic rate. Admittedly I doubt people would shower under these falls unless they have the all clear from a cardiologist. The water is freezing cold, admittedly what else could you expect.', \"The falls were magnificent...the picture doesn't do it justice. I took a video and that is much better. The amount of raging water was incredible.\", \"We just pass by this Fall. The view is great. Too bad we didn't have much time to hiking around. Walking around area is easy.\", 'We stopped here as we drove up the Icefields Parkway. The view was good near the parking lot but by walking a little bit, we were able to see the full expanse of the drop.', 'Drove out to Athabasca Falls without knowing too much about it...very easy walk to the falls and worth every step....many different view points before you actually get to the falls. You even have a chance to go down to a beach ...but quite a climb down. Other than this walk down the rest of the walk was fairly easy..Beautiful spot and well worth the trip.', \"Located very close to the Icefields Parkway and very easy to get to, it's definitely worth stopping at the falls.\", \"If you are visiting has per national park make to visit a visitor's center. We found this whilst driving, not from the road signs.It is a work of nature and worth a visit. I would say that this is not a visit for a day more about an hour or so.A definite recommend on any trip to has per national park.\", 'We visited Athabasca Falls for Canada Day. The weather was nice. I went with family, and we didn\\'t know what to expect -- we hadn\\'t saw any pictures. We just found it on a map, and decided we wanted to visit.The rushing river, the falls and the cold spray/mist of the water is inspiring.I have a heart condition, and can\\'t do much stairs, but I was able to get around for the most part. The only thing I was unable to do, was walking down to the canyon below, which meant tons of stairs coming back up.There are some negatives that have nothing to do with natures beauty however.Parking was ridiculous. It probably took 15 minutes to park -- cars lined up, everyone scouting for vehicles leaving so they\\'d snatch that parking space. Some people resorted to parking on the side of the road. Of course it was Canada Day, so it\\'d be busier than usual. But I didn\\'t know what to expect. And considering you\\'re in the middle of nowhere, you wouldn\\'t expect city-like congestion.I didn\\'t use the washroom, but 2 of my travel mates did. The acrid sharp stench of the bathrooms was unbearable. And my friend said on top of the dirty conditions, he noticed shoe-prints on the toilet seat. For alot of newcomers to Canada, all they knew in their home countries, was to \"squat\" to go to the bathroom. It\\'s unfortunate that they haven\\'t learned how to use our toilets. I guess this is part of \"multiculturalism\"? Because it was Canada Day, there were instances where I was the only English speaking person around. All I heard was Chinese, arab, hindi, pakistani, etc.The actual beauty of the falls is worth checking out. But as for amenities, it leaves something to be desired.', 'A very short hike to see the power and wonder of water. The mosquitoes are a pain (load up on bug spray) and go to the lower Falls if you can manage stairs.', \"We did this stop while driving to Jasper, and it's definitely a must do! The views of the waterfall are spectacular, and it's all within easy walking distance from the parking lot :)\", \"It's definitely one of the better ones in the Jasper National Park. Easily accessible from the parking with a minutes walk. The information signs are interesting and the viewing platforms are very safe for young children as long as an adult is holding hands. There are three different points to view the falls and all are equally beautiful.\", 'A brief stop on our Collette Canadian Rockies Tour. Easy walking trails with several viewing points of the falls.', 'With limited mobility we throughly the short level walk and were in awe of natures power to change the landscape.', \"This is a must see - any time of the year! It's so gorgeous, you are not going to believe that there is a highway near the viewing platforms. Bring your camera and walk the entire way because you will get different view points and all are beautiful. To me this signifies Alberta's rough and beautiful nature.\", 'The Falls are impressive and there are numerous paths to take advantage of the features.\\nGood parking and toilets.\\nSignage from Jasper made it easy to find.', 'We though we had seen the best after hiking Sunwapta Falls. More crowded but better. The short hike to the river is an added bonus and gets you away from the crowds.', 'Loved this attraction. This was my 2nd time to this place and it felt awesome. Multi layered falls with multiple viewpoints. A must visit if you are in the area.', \"It's right off the ice field parkway. It's a short walk from parking lot. Maybe under 10 minutes and you are already at the lower fall. Great excursion when traveling between banff and jasper. We didn't take the hiking trail to go along river.

Don't miss.\", 'One of several beautiful waterfalls in Banff National Park. A group of professional hikers were hanging ropes across the falls, possibly to shoot a video or commercial.

Superb photo opportunities.\\nShouldn't be missed.\", \"Definitely worth a visit, amazing waterfall, plenty of parking, lots of mozies so wear repellent if you don't want to get bit\", 'The Falls are impressive and the paths, platforms and informational signs are all good. We took many photos and were pleased to find good parking and toilets. We made this a separate trip from Jasper rather than a stop by on our way to Banff and are glad we did as we could not have spent the time these falls deserve.', 'Not the biggest waterfall you will see but it may well be one of the most picturesque. The water has created its own path downhill and in doing so has created an interesting waterfall. It is well worth the time spent contemplating the whole geological process happening before your eyes.We went in June at the end of the winter melt so there was plenty of water I do not know what this attraction looks like at other times.The walk is short and viewpoint good for photography although I doubt you ability to do justice to the power evident in the falls.', 'Great photo opportunity, lovely falls that you can appreciate from a few different angles to appreciate the power of the water.', 'This is a definite must visit. Simply loved it. We visited this fall on our way from Glacier Icefield to Jasper Town. There are a number of other falls along the way but this is definitely the best. We even caught a rainbow over the fall too. Simply beautiful and amazing. And it is only approx. 30 mins from Jasper town.', \"We visited this waterfall as part of a day-long bus tour. It was our last stop and the most enjoyable of the day. So beautiful! So much power!

The falls are absolutely amazing! Loved all the little trails, especially seeing where the the water used to run through!', 'The numerous water falls make this River so interesting to photograph and just enjoy the power of the fast flowing water. The river actually flows North which is a novelty for me being from the lower 48. The cold temperature of the water makes a refreshing mist as it cascades through the narrow gorges. There are many viewing locations within a short walking distance from parking area.', 'Athabasca Falls is in Jasper National Park on the upper Athabasca River, approximately 30 kms south of Jasper Canada, and west of the Icefields. The falls can be seen and photographed from various viewing platforms and walking trails around the falls. Access is from the nearby parking lot, which leads off Highway 93A just northeast of the falls. Highway 93A takes off from the nearby Icefields Parkway, and crosses the falls on the way north to the town of Jasper. White water rafting often starts below the falls to travel downstream on the Athabasca River to Jasper.It is a Class 5 waterfall, with a drop of 24m and a width of 18m. (Thanks for the help of Wikipedia to get my directions right!)You will need about 30 minutes to view this. Worth a stop.', 'Second time visiting this fall in 6 years and not a bit disappointed, the fall and the calm-after-the-fall area are both stunningly beautiful, the stairs going down are good photo oppt. Good enjoyable hour spent there. Highly recommended. Parking may be an issue if you get there late in high season.', 'We took a bit of a side trip from Jasper to see the Athabasca Falls - and we were rewarded with another beautiful display of the powers of nature. The waters roar over the falls and into the several crevasses that have formed over the years. There is an entire separate ecosystem around the falls where you can see all kinds of different kinds of fauna . You need to walk to the bottom of the main waterfall to really feel and see the power of the water. Then continue walking to the opposite side of the falls so you get to feel the spray . So pretty and breathtaking. Worth the short drive from Jaser.', \"We had no idea what to expect but this stop on our tour was one of the best. There's a hardened path (not paved) but very easily navigated from parking to the falls that takes 3-5 minutes to walk. The falls are very impressive - such a great place to take photos. When we were there it was very congested with people but it was well worth our time and effort.\", \"Visited here during a day trip to Jasper and it's attractions. The falls whilst having some steps and slopes are within easy access of the car park. When we visited, early afternoon, there were some crowds but not sufficient to get in our way or detract from our visit. The views all round are beautiful and the falls exhibit quite clearly years of water erosion on the rocks, creating pot holes - just remember your camera to capture it or an audio video is well worth the effort to capture it all.\", 'We are in Jasper for a couple of nights on an organised Saga holiday from UK through to Calgary, Banff, Jasper, Rocky Mountaineer and cruise to Alaska.This is an included photo stop on an organised day trip. Everywhere we have been in Canada so far has given us the WOW factor, and this is no different. In spring, with the snow melt from the mountains, there is a huge volume of water coming through this narrow gorge. Combine that with the surrounding geological features and consider that the falls have been eroding the gorge for millions of years and you are a part of history of the place. It is then that you realise how insignificantly small we are in the bigger picture.', 'One of my favourite spots in Jasper. I come here often. I had a lovely day taking in the scenery. Parking was busy but do able. What I hated though was the mess made by people coming on and off the tour busses. There were several busses there and people were littering I think the tour director should personally pick up the mess if your guests are too lazy to do so. This is a national park. Tip - go first thing before 9am or after 5pm after the rush. Go down the steps to the pothole and enjoy the rushing water, the beautiful colour of the falls and see if you can spot the rainbow. Take eerie pictures on the steps when nobody is around. Amazing.', 'Another beautiful sight to see in western Canada. So impressive and yet another representation of the strength and beauty of nature. We loved it.', \"It's worth stopping here for 20-30 mins just to see the surge of water and the mist created by this beautiful and powerful waterfall. The walkway is easy to follow, with informational signs along the way. Definitely take a little time out to experience these Falls.\", 'Excellent view of the falls with interpretation boards along the path. The path is an easy walk and parts of it are wheelchair accessible. Worth the stop and short hike (about 100 yards) from the parking lot.', \"We stopped here, while heading south from Jasper. Parking was easy, with a couple of lots. The falls are magnificent. The roaring water, and the mountains in the back ground make them really outstanding. The pathways are paved, and easy to get around. We lucked out, and got to meet a guy (Colin from Grande Prairie?) doing slack-lining across the falls. He had a rope tied to each side of the falls. He walked across and back, barefoot! Whoa! It was unbelievable. What a character, and what nerves of steel!It's a beautiful place to stop, and get lots of photos.\", 'Amazing waterfalls and very easy to access. Very popular stop so parking can be a challenge, but well worth the trip.', 'We were glad we stopped to see the falls. It was the last stop before Jasper and we were tempted to pass it by. Easy walk, and doable for those w mobility issues. Very picturesque. 20 minutes or so does it justice.', 'I hail from Arizona so when I see a waterfall, I go crazy with the water volumes, feeling incredibly energized and quite frankly, envious. The water here is crazy big this season from the snow melt and the glacier melt from upstream cutting through the granite. The wooded and rocky setting added to ambiance. The walkways are easy to navigate as the fresh and moist air is enjoyed. No bugs in June!', 'Stunning to watch--amazing! Beautiful areas to walk and take pictures--take the canyon walk and try to imagine the water flowing with such force!', 'Easy stop off of the icefields Parkway . Trails at top and to bottom of falls. Many perfect picture spots. Some if it is handicapped accessible. Port o potties in parking lot . Plan on 20-30 minutes.', 'This place is magical, the force of the waters have carved out a beautiful setting to see. Walkways are railed off for safety but children should be attended to.', \"Of the many falls along the Icefield Parkway this one is very easily accessible after just a short walk, and is an amazing spectacle for it's pure beauty and power.\", \"Great hiking trails, the falls you can follow all the way during your walk... just beautiful... nature at it's best\", 'We loved this hike! We started at the first bridge and worked our way down. My husband was smart enough to realize that my in laws and 6 year old daughter may not want to trek back uphill and ran back to the car, parked at the 5th bridge parking lot and met us in the middle. It is a long walk back uphill if you start from the 1st bridge. If you have small kids you may want to do what my husband did or hike from 6th or 5th bridge lot up and have a nice downhill return. Gorgeous!', 'We were on a tour of a near by area and decided to call in for a look. Beautiful scenery and a smooth water course that changes as it enters a narrow channel that become the falls. Lots of photo opertunities to get pictures of the water hurling through the rocks and dropping in spactular fashion through th gorge until it completes its charge into a lower lake. There is a bridge crossing the gorge that leads to hiking trails or a loop back to the car park.', 'What a great visit to see the waters fall and thunder by. Great views and lovely pics taken. A WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE ALL ROUND. a MUST SEE.', 'This actually was my first trip to Athabasca Falls, I thought it was amazing coz of the proximity to the water from where I stood. I could feel the energy that was roaring by me. Never underestamite the power of water!!', 'Worth a visit if you are passing through, the area is quiet and falls worth a view. There are also picnic areas and toilet facilities on site', 'Beautiful waterfalls with hiking trails. A short stop-over to Jasper from our packaged excursion to the Columbia Icefield and saw strong rapid water gushing from the falls and at times forming a beautiful rainbow over it. Beautiful serene surrounding the falls.', 'Well worth a slight detour to have a look. Well laid out trails allow viewing of the falls. The water was rushing through when we were there in the Spring.', 'Gorgeous views how the waters and time has routed out the caverns and pools for the water. Wonderful experience.', \"Loved going to this beautiful attraction. I would recommend good walking or hiking boots, a camera, bug spray and a sense of adventure! It's not a very difficult hike, but it does require some stability on the up/down.\", 'This stop is educational and impressive. This stop has outhouse facilities, picnic tables and clean water. Parking is ample and the venue is handicap accessible. Allocate a minimum of 30 minutes for this stop.', \"beautiful falls & several areas to look above or below the falls. don't stay at the upper view point, be sure to walk down the trail for wonderful views as well. can feel crowded along walkways if several tour buses are there\", \"t doesn't matter how often you come here the magistic scenery is breath taking. It is a chance to just enjoy what nature is capable of\", \"Very few words can describe this place. Mainly stunning and wow! It's only a short stroll from the car park and well worth a quick stop off to see the falls. Take plenty of pictures from all angles. You will get plenty of good ones!\", 'Nice stop on the Icefield Parkway but more crowded than the opening of a new IKEA. Probably best to avoid middle of the day.', 'One of the best sites in Jasper. The power of the falls was amazing. They did a good job with the interpretive displays. Easy trail to walk around and see from different perspectives.', 'Lovely walk by the falls Interesting scenery and well worth the walk - a bit challenging for those with mobility issues.', 'The falls are not very tall but nonetheless very pretty. You will love the place. Ideal picnic spot. We saw it as part of our tour with Brewster.', 'We took a motorcycle tour to the Falls. They are breathtaking. We could have looked at them all day. Highly recommend!', 'You view falls from thw top end of it here. We cisited when it was raining heavy and water was wild. It has some good walkways made around it and picture spots too but there are many othwr great falls apart from it. Nothing special about it.', 'The Athabasca Falls is approximately 33 kilometers south of Jasper and offers very scenic views and good viewing vantage points. Good parking, pathways and a great place to have a picnic lunch.', 'We left Jasper early one morning and went straight to the Falls. By the time we arrived, it was snowing rather heavily (early June 2017) and we were almost alone there. There are many waterfalls in the Banff-Jasper area, but these are well worth a visit. Like everything else, however, I would definitely go early to beat the tour bus crowds.', 'We loved the falls. The power of the water was impressive. Easy to walk around and great picture vantage points.', \"My title says it all. It is NOT the largest, most powerful or grandest of all falls, but it is impressive in it's own right. I find it simply amazing what plain old water can do to something as strong and hard as stone. Persistence!!\", 'Definitely a large reward for the little effort to get to these falls. Something amazing to see without a long hike. They are so beautiful and there are a lot of different points on the trail to see them. Also the walk through the carved rock is kind of like a tunnel and a neat experience.', 'The falls a an amazing place to visit anytime of the year. Frozen in winter and very energizing during spring and summer time. Fantastic spot to visit while spending time in Jasper.', 'Well worth spending an hour here to take in all the different views of these Falls. There are many Falls in the park but you can really walk around this one to take it all in. Very powerful!', 'What stunning views from here. Even braved the glass viewing platform and was so glad I did. Perfect place for photos.', 'Well worth the visit. Got quite a few stunning photos here. Could have spent much more time at this location.', 'Very easy walk too see this waterfall once you park.......worth the trip to view if you like waterfalls!', 'What an amazing place...the beauty is undescribable. We stopped here on a whim...it wasnt on our list of places to visit. So happy we did...so please add to your list for a spectaclar site!!', 'The recent rains fueled the falls. They were really going when we visited. Rangers shared info about a 12 point elk horn and a big horned sheep horn. They let us hold the horns to feel the weight. We got selfies with the rangers too. The falls are a very easy short walk from the parking area.', 'Love Athabasca falls. Took my kids for the first time. Just the scenery is breathtaking. Kids were amazed', 'One great vista after another. Water colors unrivaled with chasms, garges, and falls galore. Well worth a visit.', 'We stopped here on our way to the hotel in Jasper - stunning. Absolutely stunning. Worth the wander around it for some excellent photos.', \"This is a must see, you cannot go up the Parkway and not stop here for a look, well worth the stop, plus it's only a short walk to the falls\", 'After a disappointing ice field visit, we were impressed with the falls. We were able to take in the beauty of the falls, river, and rock formations that make this attraction a need to see. Even with a number of tourasses around, we got good views of the areas open to the public and see the wonders of nature. Stop in and see this if you are ever in the area. It is a must see.', 'We were lucky enough to have a totally blue sky and sun for our visit here. We literally had rainbows over the falls. Stunning!', 'We liked this because of its easy accessibility. No long hikes to the waterfall itself. We visited in Spring so waters were at a high level and the sound and fury of the waters as they fell into the gorge was a sight (and sound) to behold. Interesting rock formation around the gorge too.', \"On the Icefields Parkway in Jasper National Park, Alberta, CA. Rated one of the most scenic highways in the world, and justly deserved, these falls are a don't miss topping to magnificent scenery. Essentially the Grand Tetons of Canada in my opinion\", 'Great fall at the Icefields Park Way. Short easy trail to the fall. What a power water has. Nice viewspots.', 'A short drive from Jasper to view wonderful scenery. A great location for photography. There are also toilets at this spot.', 'Great place to get out and walk all around the falls. They have done a great job making it very easy to look at from all angles.', 'The amount of water this year was incredible! The water was high and moving so fast. The spray was like a light shower. Beautiful and awesome to feel the power of this waterfall. One of the most impressive falls in the area.', 'We stopped by these falls when most of the rivers in this area were at flood stage. The amount of water flowing over the falls was astounding. They were as beautiful as Niagara Falls.', 'This was part of Rockies tour and it was awesome, would recommend it to all ages to see, a slight walk not to demanding but worth it, views are awesome.', 'Very well organised and very short walk from car park\\nThe old canyon is also very interesting\\nDefinitely to be visited', 'Such a beautiful spot, a must stop on your trip if you can accommodate. The falls are spectacular and there are lots of great vantage points and photo opportunities.', 'Stopped here on our way to Jasper. Lovely area with good views of the waterfall. Nice place for picnic.', 'Just stunning!! We are in awe of the amount of water around Canada and the amazing waterfalls as a result. Great views, lookouts and hiking trail.', 'Spring thaw came late this hear so the falls were more like a glacier the\\\\an a waterfall . Very beautiful and an adventure to negotiate the frozen and flooded paths .', \"One of our 'must sees' on our trip and not disappointed. We intended to go to the Ink Pots but the views and photo opportunities to the upper falls meant we ran out of time. The trail has been made to allow easy access with minimal disruption to the natural beauty of the canyon.\", 'Easy pull off of Icefields Parkway. Beautiful falls with great viewing areas. Lots of parking. Would be a lovely place for a picnic.', 'Wonderful truly enjoy this . Impressive. Not very crowded when we went. Beautiful pictures taken. Be careful walking around not very safe but worth the effort.', 'The best of best places is in here. I mean JASPER. Another place one can never skip to visit . As far as I know I am going for round 2,3....', 'Great photo shots from many areas. Reminded me of Watkins Glen in NY. Great to see snow around the falls in multiple areas.', 'Although it was a small fall, it was simply superb! There were a few angles to view the fall, so it was just refreshing to see it at those angles. Took a lot of pictures..Look out for the rainbow!', 'You can get very close to the falls from a number of vantage points. Easy to walk to. Be sure to also see the abandoned waterway along the walking trail to the falls.', 'The fall is located right by the Icefield Parkway, an easy stop between Jasper and Banff. It offers a short stroll to see snow-capped mountain and a nice fall.', \"It didn't seem like much when we started but the falls are just beautiful. It twists and turns through narrow rock chasms, huge holes carved by the waters. The paths and bridges through the area give wonderfully different view for some great photos.\", 'I visited as part of a touring holiday and was blown away by these falls. They were truly a sight to be seen at this time of year as they were in full flow.', 'A great waterfall to visit near Jasper. Quite easy to reach and very god facilities at the attraction. It is a 15 minute walk from the car parking to the waterfall area. It is well paved and easy to get to. There are a lot of areas where you can get great views of the falls for great photo Op. On the whole we had a very memorable time here and highly recommend it.', \"This was our last chance to stretch our legs and engage our eyes on the Brewster Icefields Parkway Banff to Jasper Tour. We stopped 30 miles short of Jasper and ambled from the car park set away from waterfall (with facilities available after all that rushing water). We had time to take some close shots of the Falls and its glorious mountain backdrop and stroll over the different bridges for different views. As always it would have been good to have walked a little further and spent more time taking in the beauty, but that's not the point of a tour like this. . Our Brewster's driver, Jarrod, who'd been excellent all the way had the unfortunate job of finishing the tour by telling us of a cancelled Maligne Lake tour the next day due to a forest fire in the wrong place. His care of us on the day would make me recommend this tour to others.\", 'An easy stop right off the highway a short distance south of Jasper. Paved walkways and stairs take you around, above, across and below the falls and canyon. Very much worth the time to visit. We took the back road (not maintained in winter) on the trip into Jasper and found this less traveled route very scenic and interesting. The road is paved but is bumpy and narrow in places.', 'Impressive waterfall located just off the Icefields Parkway. Definitely worth a photo stop especially in springtime when snowmelt provides lots of flow.', 'The Athabasca Falls is worth the visit if you are in the area. Plan to stay around 30 minutes if you plan to see everything, including the old canyon.', 'So close to roaring water. You will get some fabulous pictures! Only takes 15 minutes and well worth the time.', 'Make sure you visit these Falls, they were amazing. So much water rushing through the rocks and falling down', 'A good pretty falls, you do get a bit punch drunk on the amount of the falls and they do all start to fade together but these were good. A nice walk too on a good day . Worth the visit', 'A lot of these places are good if you are touring by car. Good explanatory boards to aid your visit. just allow 30 mins unless you want to do the hiking round it', 'This may not be the biggest waterfall in the world but it is a worthwhile stop to stretch your legs and see both the force of the waterfall and the peaceful river.', 'We almost missed going here and are so glad we did go. It is a very pretty falls and hardly anyone was there.', 'We enjoyed our visit to the falls. It takes about an hour if you go slowly. It is safe and beautiful.', 'The Athabasca river really thunders through this narrow gorge. Lots of paths and bridges to allow you to see and photograph safely, but still understand the power of the river.Its a good 30 minute stop on the road between Jasper and Lake Louise, or you can follow the trails and spend lots of time. Once you leave the main track there are few people around. The main parts get tourist coaches by the dozen.', \"It's on occasions like this that TripAdvisor's rating policy confuses me. If, as many reviewers have rated it, this is a 5 star attraction, then how many stars would Niagara Falls receive from the same reviewers? This is pleasant enough and worthy of a trip whilst visiting Jasper or driving down the 93, but it's no Niagara so we've given it a rating of 3 which we think is fair. We arrived fairly early in the day and it was very pleasant, although it was spoilt when a coach load of tourists arrived and rather rudely noisily jostled for prime positions. I can imagine it's not overly pleasant during high season. The parking lot was probably 10% full when we arrived and I'm guessing it won't be much fun when it's full. Recommended, but be careful when you go and only expect a 5 start attraction if you've never seen a waterfall before!\", 'We were on a three week vacation from the UK travelling around western Canada. We dropped in about 9.30 am as it was very easy on our way from Jasper to Lake Louise. We were surprised to see so many coaches there already so early, but it did not stop us from seeing the Falls briefly. There was no need to hang about though. If you can, get there before 9.00 am.', 'These falls are beautiful and stunning, with lots of informative signs to tell you all about what you are looking at and seeing.', 'The Athabasca River thunders through a narrow water-carved sluice here and a network of paved paths and bridges allow visitors to safely approach and observe up close the power of the river. It was a special treat to spot some delicate ground orchids blooming near the path here in late May.', 'Happened to visit Athabasca on our way out from Jasper to Banff. Stopped there and it was the most amazing place I saw. Highly recommended!', 'Picturesque spot, wide falls with lots of water flowing over, saw a rainbow in the falls. Spend a little or a lot of time.', \"A nice waterfall to see. It wasn't too crowded. You can get a good view from the bridge. Not far out of the way.\", 'Love the main attraction but lots of other interesting views as well. In may the little calypso orchids are out so delicate along the forest pathway.', 'See the initial falls, then see the results off the falls down to the lake. It is really impressive to follow the water. We saw the falls in a dry period and after a rainy perio, really impressive!', 'We visited this on a cloudy day. Even though it was cloudy it was still beautiful. The only thing was there were people jumping the fence to get very close to the waterfall and they were getting in the way of our pictures.', 'Well worth a stop on the way to or from the glacier, allow plenty of time to explore the trails and take photographs from the many viewpoints.', 'Great hike, easy trail - not too long, not too short . Excellent place to stop when going to Jasper.', 'Been there three times. They are beautiful falls and canyon... This time, went there in the winter... slippery... The falls were hard to see as they were covered by ice... an interesting perspective and contrast to seeing them in the summer', \"Hardly anyone there. The rush of the falls. Ravens feeding chicks in nests built into the rockface. Need telescope camera to get into their rock face nooks... Moss pillows on tops of canyon, narrow gorges and the sound of rushing waters...different colours of rock formations...too beautiful; a cold day so couldn't stay out too long, will try for autumn next year.\", 'Beautiful views and landscape. Popular stop for tourists. Not stroller friendly. My father inlaw said this was his favourite stop on our rocky mountain trip.', \"Your hike here can be as short or as long as you want it to be. From the parking area, you can get to all the major angles of the falls within a few minutes. But you also have the option of walking up the river, so it's really the perfect hike. I suggest getting there early - tourists tend to linger excessively long in all of those spots you'd like to take photos.\", \"The nice thing about this hike is that it is a short distance from the parking lot, so all ages can easily enjoy this place. There are plenty of informative signs around to educate you on the progression of the falls, potholes, the canyon, etc. You'll notice a temperature drop from the observation deck down to the canyon - and the mist from the falls feels nice on a warm day. Many great viewing angles available.\", \"If you are looking for an easy hike this is well worth your time. The sights are spectacular. A little off the beaten path we weren't fighting any crowds though we went off season.\", \"This is a must see for everyone to see the awesome power of water and time!..been over 25 years since we were last here and it's still amazing.\", 'We stopped at a lot of places along the Icefields Parkway from Banff to Jasper. This was our favorite. Beautiful area.', 'Close to Jasper and great drive to location\\nTrails are great and must take go pro gear for capturing all scenic spots\\nYou can choose a short hike to open area to chill out and enjoy mountain peaks', 'A must see. Gorgeous scenery and easy walking trails. Senior citizens will be able to navigate the trails with ease. Highly recommend adding this stop to your itenary.', 'low water season but still worth the look. Easy walk to the falls from parking area. Short drive from town', 'It is a beautiful spot however it is full of tourists. Hard to take a picture without having other people in it. it is still worth a visit.', \"Situated about 30kms from Jasper Athabasca Falls are very nice,heaps of parking for RV's and buses,easy walk down to the falls with various stops for good photo opportunities,toilets are there as well.\", 'Great scenery and really good little hike. Trails were a bit sloppy in place but that is to be expected that time of year', 'The most stunning views and lots of boards posting geological explanations about the Falls. Easily accessible walk to the Falls which can be viewed from several lookout points. Good signage about safety and warnings to keep on the paths plenty benches to relax all around. Very level and easy walk. 30km south of Jasper a short distance off 93A', 'The walking/viewing area was very well done and offered enough options for everyone from short walks to more extensive areas.', \"On a tip from a Parks Canada rep who suggested Athabasca Falls over Sunwapta Falls as we only wanted to do one, we stopped on our way to Jasper from the Columbia Icefields.We started with our stroller but took it back to the car in favour of a baby carrier so that we could do the further reaches of the trail. It's listed as a moderate trail, but I'd say that the main part is easy, but the old canyon section is moderate. The views were simply breathtaking. The water crashing was just awe-inspiring, and we loved that they included the old canyon on the trail so that you could see where the water used to go. If you have good shoes and can manage some steep steps and uneven ground, follows the signs to the river, where the water ends up. It's quieter than the Falls and a perfectly picturesque vista for photos.Fantastic stop, close to the highway and Jasper, and you don't need to walk far to be rewarded with fantastic views of the Falls and surroundings. Also has toilets and picnic benches, which is a bonus!\", \"Have been to these falls many times over the years. It's always a nice visit. The falls are beautiful and it's easy to get around with little ones.\", 'Athabasca falls are absolutely stunning place to see. we make sure we go every time. It changes every year because the water hitting the rocks. So many different views and walks to take.', 'Good walking for whole family trip. Big,noisy and cold waterfall with gorgeous texture of mountings sure is best place to take a family pictures.', 'So pretty and easy to see and take lots of photos. The color of the water is ice blue from the melting glacial waters.', 'These falls were so beautiful. Right off of highway 93, it is a close walk from the parking lot and a great spot to stretch your legs while on a road trip. Easy paths to walk on, great for kids as well as pushing a wheelchair or stroller.', \"The falls are just off the hiway and easily accessible so you can take as much or as little time as you like to explore, parking is good, washrooms available. Tourists - STAY ON THE TRAIL don't wreck the area.\", 'Very spectacular view. The rest area is well laid out and they have public restrooms as well. easy paths to walk. Very short distance from the vehicle to viewing area', \"We visited these falls as part of our tour with Brewster's tours. The falls are beautiful and worth a visit.\", \"It's nice but not that amazing .\\nLocated near the road.\\nWhy I have to wright a lot.\\nIt's not that big fall in do not know why they call fall any way.\", \"Beautiful spot to visit - easy to get to if you're self driving. Lots of good spots for photos. While there are the trails along the falls - good walking shoes are a nice idea.\", \"Just go! It was an incredible walkabout falls that are fed by a glacier. It is a short walk and you will see the falls and walk through an old channel. Bring your camera for great shots. I just don't know where else in the world you can see nature like this.\", 'The falls are beautiful and a must stop and see if you are in the area. There are walking paths to many view points and public washrooms on site', 'This is my favourite place to visit in Jasper (25km south on Hwy 93). Worth it to take the time to visit not only at the top, but at the bottom along the river. Never ceases to impress.', \"Thunderous and thrilling cannot begin to describe the Athabasca Falls experience! Water is a beautiful hue, and it's journey through the rock formations is wondrous to behold.\", 'We passed by here after our Colombian Glacier Ice field trip and I may say we kept coming back here.It is a well kept falls with reasonable amount of parking .If you want a relaxing gateway this is the place .Beautiful scenery and lots of points of history in the area .', 'Stopped here for 20 mins or so and it was only a short walk from the car park. Great attraction as the there were two falls actually, the one to the left is wider and more timid and the one to the right is narrower but pretty ferocious - reminds me of the power of Niagara Falls.', \"A can't miss stop on the road to or from Jasper. Take video along with pics to get the sound of roaring waters.\\nEasy hike\", 'Just off the highway and only a very short walk from the car park. The falls are definately worth the visit.', 'Must visit place and ultimate to visit.It was owe some place and one must visit any season of the year.', 'I stop in to visit these falls every time I am in the area. They are beautiful, but unfortunately crowded in the summer season. Snap your pictures quickly and prepare to step aside so everyone can enjoy a moment and opportunity to capture a memory. There are tons of little trails everywhere so if you have kids or pets, make sure they are attached to you in some way. The crowding can really overpower anybody under four feet tall. There are picnic areas which are nice and some are in the shade for hot days. I personally enjoyed my time the most when I visited once in March, not many people and parts of the falls were still frozen and gorgeous.', 'This is a must stop while in the Jasper Park. There is plenty of parking and easy paved trails to view the waterfalls and river. The rock formation around this waterfall is so beautiful. The day we went it was raining and snowing so trails were pretty wet. We just stayed in the main area. There is lots of signs telling you about this area. Very interesting that this river and falls flows to the Artic Ocean.', 'After having done the Maligne area (lakes & canyon) we had one final visit on the agenda: Athabasca Falls. (Our) GPS did not help out in finding it so we had to do it the \"oldfashioned\" way with a map, but that had too little detail. Resulting in us - coming from Jasper - starting at the wrong end of the 93A, coming around the long route to the falls.Some really bad sections of road we came across; better lift your foot off the gas there and try to avoid the worst patches (traffic allowing of course). Better of course to travel down the 93 South a bit further and take the second exit to the 93A.The Falls themselves at this time of year are spectacular with ice and snow still present. Makes for some great pictures, really. One can get pretty close to the Falls at various spots and angles. Absolutely worth the trip!', 'It had been a long time since I visited the falls but we had family over from Ontario and we had time for 2 attractions - Athabasca falls had to make the list.The falls were kind of low because it was early in the season and the mountains still had a lot of melting to do. However, the path to the back area where you can check out the canyon was flooded so it was pretty difficult to get back there.Even with the lower water on the falls, it is still a majestic sight and sound (I love the roar). One of the water runs was frozen which was an added bonus.', 'A great place to click lovely pictures ..Worth a visit on road trip from jasper to Banff ...We visited them in morning', 'After visiting the Columbia ice field we returned to Jasper by way if the Athabaska falls. The walk round the falls is well laid out. There are notices to give you information and you are advised to set aside half an hour to do the walk. A path from one side of the lower area to the other side is currently under water so you need to walk along a couple of tree trunks! This may not appeal to everyone. At this time of year there is overhanging snow so it makes a very pretty sight.', \"I highly recommend taking the time to stop here, it is definitely worth it. It's beautiful and easy to get around.\", 'The falls and the gorge that they have created are marvels of nature. Sort of puts in your place if you think that mankind can have a major long-term impact on the environment. Walk up and around and down the gorge for a full tour.', 'Athabasca Falls are so lovely and the walk around the area is nice. The path to follow is an easy walk and the views of the river down below are awesome. The Athabasca River is a really nice color and makes for nice pictures. I will say, people need to be careful and mind the railings and barriers. People always want to climb over them to get better pictures, but people have fallen and died here, so respect the Park rules!', 'Take your camera you will get plenty of great shots. Keep your eyes open for chipmunks, and other small animals. The falls are amazing and well worth the stop', 'Visited only for a few minutes when driving to Jasper. Worth the stop to see the fall. Very pretty and there are a few levels you can stand at to see the fall.', 'Excellent stop! Loved the Athabasca falls hike. we visited in August with our two teenage sons. Great hike, but gets busy so get their early.', \"I've been to Athabasca Falls in all seasons and it's beautiful no matter what time of year it is! Lots of chances for great photos!\", \"We visit this falls during our way from Jasper to Banff. This falls are near the highway, but really nice to visit. It's no problem to visit it with young childs.\", 'Excellent stop. Unbelievable view of falls. With a mountains in the backround. Highly recommended. AND ITS FREEEEEE!!!!', \"We took our 2 toddlers to the falls and had nice time. The walk is short and fairly easy. There was still some ice and snow on some parts of the path but we could see a lot. Part of the falls was frozen still. The lower walk way was so full of water that we couldn't access it like we could during summer. It's a must see and easy to visit with the whole family.\", 'amazing views, scenery, my favouirite place in Jasper. very peaceful and relaxing.I go there every time we are in Jasper.', 'Very beautiful falls, there is picnic spots, and it is a short walk. Worth the detour from the road.', \"Its all described in the other reviews, but if you're able-bodied enough, and have the time (and if you don't have the time them make time), and the underfoot conditions allow (i.e. its not iced over), then clamber your way down to the actual lake for a view that is simply spectacular. Dare to go for a paddle !\", \"Forget about it, don't go to Jasper or be on the Icefield Parkway and not stop here. Short walk from the parking lot for amazing view, longer trail down to the bottom if you're interested.\", 'Lovely stop off between Banff and Jasper. Good parking with outhouses. Great views over the falls with a large mountain in the background. Lovely colours in the water and we were lucky enough to see snow and ice down the falls.', 'I wish we had more time to walk around all the trails but we had to settle for the main viewing area. It was truly beautiful and we will for sure go again and spend more time there.', 'Great location as it was just a couple of minutes walk from the parking lot. Very close to highway. Turquoise waters.', 'A spectacular view awaits you along many other recommendable stops along the Icefields Parkway. The gush of water squeezing past the gorge is mesmerising, you could stare at it forever!', 'Located between Jasper and the Columbia Ice Fields …. The falls itself wasn’t particularly mind blowing, but historically it possessed enough strength to carve out a small gorge immediately downstream of it. Make sure you walk down the canyon to observe the force of the water and the beautiful different blues hues of the water', 'We visited in April so it was still partially frozen but makes for a lovely stop on your way to/from Jasper.\\nAccessible trail during warm seasons.', \"In summer and winter it's just beautiful and a nice little hike down to the bottom, in summer you get a must which is really refreshing and the winter you can really see the amazing icicles and colours of the water\", '30 minutes to walk arround , very bussy in summer, waterfalls are special! Parking area could be full.', \"The waterfall itself is still iced over for the most part but it doesn't take away from the beauty of it all. A nice area for a picnic and take in the beauty and fresh air. Will be coming back this summer\", 'Very beautiful falls with milky blue water from the glacier flower. Easy hiking trails and great photo opportunities.', \"The parking is ok. Thank god it had outhouses in the parking lot. At one end is the gift shop and food etc. The other end has the sign with the trail info to begin there. It doesn't matter which way you start. Not as packed as I thought it would be. But plan your trip wisely. If in tourist season get there early 7-9 am or you won't get parking. OR sleep in, organize the kids and get there for late lunch or dinner time. You're in the woods so a cooler time of day is best. Very well groomed trails. You cant get lost. You have your choice of a long or short hike. The more you hike the more you see. The path along the canyons and water are amazing. One trail loops around and is basically a trail running horizontally to the water trail but not much to see up there. I would have turned around and went back along the water trail again!. I couldn't stop taking pictures. Nice informational signs showing different birds, trees, plant species, history of this area. Great to stop and take a break for 30 seconds. The signs make the whole experience better because you'll start noticing all the stuff they're talking about. Its a great way to challenge kids to find everything on the sign. Make them read it and point out what they find. Bribe....I mean..... Reward them with ice cream as the prize haha. Anyways worth the trip. I was supposed to rock climb down these cliffs, on a tour, but I threw out my back brushing my teeth if you can believe it, so I couldn't go. That would have been awesome hanging right above the rapids and rushing water!\", 'Stunning as always, well worth the short drive south to see this beautiful location highly recommended', 'Visited on route from Jasper to Banff on a very quiet day - there was only one other car in the car park. The falls are very close to the car park - 2 minute walk, but the walkway was very icy and could have been dangerous. But on arrival on the viewing bridge it was a spectacular site - falls were running under the ice and running through into a blue water channel through the canyon. Easy to access / great photo opportunity just off the main road.', \"I've visited these falls before in summer and this time most of the falls were frozen BUT water was flowing and it was really interesting to see how the melt was being shaped by the water flow.Even in summer these falls are worth a visit, they're on the main route between Jasper lake Louise and Banff so there's no diversion necessary. The falls are 200 meters from the convenient car park very near the main road.\", 'Athabasca Falls is definitely worth the short drive and short walk to see the falls. It is a two or three minute walk from the parking lot. It is easy to see how the river cut through the rock if you stand and watch for a few minutes and just imagine the power. Walk over the bridge and take the trail to the right to the bottom.', 'Easy access and paved pathways give access to this spectacular waterfall. The canyons are beautiful and there are stone staircase/steps that trail around part of the feature. Care should be taken and visitors should keep to the pathway. Climbing up on the outcrops can be dangerous and slippery (but I still saw people doing it while we were there). Benches and tables available for picnics.', \"We had already done some hiking for the day and my children were tired so it was nice to be able to see this waterfall within steps of the parking lot. It isn't as spectacular in the winter but still beautiful. The road coming in was pitted and would be very rough for a car as the snow was melting but not much you can do about Mother Nature!\", 'They were nice but surprised they are not bigger--kind of icy walking the paths--had to hang onto the fence to prevent falling--maybe a bit of sand would help', 'This is one of our favourite places to stop in the summer, these falls never disappoint us. We decided to check them out while they were frozen... they were amazing. No one in the parking lot. There is a short trek to the falls that was quite slick, but well worth the view. You need to stop here in the winter and the summer!', 'Athabasca Falls has an extensive walkway and bridges around it, which gives you great views of the rushing water plummeting into the deep gorge and canyon. The turbulence of the water can be viewed from several aspects, one being right over it, so you can really appreciate the rushing water. It is said to have more volume ofvwater going over it than Niagara Falls. Beautiful scenery can be found all around the falls as well as on the route to it. Another great spot to stop in Jasper National Park.', 'I have been to Athabasca Falls many times and in every season. It is never disappointing. The scenery is breathtakingly beautiful and well worth a visit! It is nice to check out in the less busy times as it can get quite crowded.', 'Spring runoff made the walk glare ice. Brought boot traction aids and it made the trip much easier. Sport shops in town had them in adult small which fit our 3 and 5 year old kids, they loved it.', '30 mins south of Jasper are the spectacular falls. Definitely worth a visit. The walkways were very icy and slippery in March, but the short walk is worth the effort.', 'A great little stop along the highway on your drive to Jasper from Banff or the other way around. A great little break for the kids in your car.', \"If we say that The Niagara Falls are spectacular, then we would say that Athabasca Falls are charming. They just have different styles. The both are easily accessible. We're much closer to Niagara Falls ,so we hold the Athabasca Falls dearer.\", 'Short 15 minute walk to falls through the snow.Great shots of falls even though frozen..Lots of photo shots along the way.Dont get to close to frozen lake to get a better shot as a few people have lost their lives.', \"With a powerful rush and roar, the falls drop 80 feet into a narrow gorge. You can see how water has carved the rock over eons. You can cross the gorge on a bridge, stopping mid way to gape from on high. It's a short walk from the parking lot.\", 'Before you get to Jasper, coming from Banff, first, it is very convenient to stop for a nice look at the Athabasca Falls, which are in Jasper National Park. There is a nice walkway or path that leads you to different viewpoints of the Falls. It is not a very large area, if there are a lot of people there at the same time as you are, you have to juggle your way around. But do stop for a look. Very pretty to see.', 'Went to this place. It was beautiful. One must beware of the rainey season: the river can get really high and nasty.', 'It was Spectacular... Well worth going for a look. We were driving down the highway and decided to stop for a look. WOW, what a sight, easy to walk to, the power of that Waterfall, what a site.', 'We visited here in February so everything was frozen! Very scenic, great for photography but watch your step as the pathways were completely iced over.', 'An extremely beautiful falls which is very easy to access. There is one spot where you can get fully wet from the drizzle from the falls. There is a trail from the falls which leads to a beautiful scenery.', 'I have been to Athabasca Falls in summer and in winter it is so beautiful and impressive during both seasons! There are many view points and all parts around the Falls are fenced off! Please respect those railings, they are there for your safety!', 'This falls drops 80 feet through a narrow gorge. An easy walking path takes you to see the top drop. There is a bridge over the gorge and multiple places to get great photos and videos. Mesmerizing and magnificent - the power of nature and the beauty of rock and water.', 'A must see if you like water falls! Beautiful and powerful! Beautiful landscape! Just breath taking!', 'Car park is located just off the highway within 1 minute drive, very short walk to the falls, with not too much of a hill. There is a trail around the falls so you can explore a bit more, not very strenuous to walk. Natural beauty and power of the falls is breathtaking', \"About 20-25 minute drive south of Jasper, easy short walk from the parking lot. We went late February and the walkways and paths were super icy, so wear good footwear. So interesting to see the deep canyons and frozen waterfall, with pools of crystal-blue water swirling around. Definitely check out all the different viewpoints/lookouts, it's beautiful. Can't wait to come back in the summer to see the falls in all their glory!\", 'Always a hit to pitstop here with out of country friends or when travelling with kids or seniors.incredible photo ops.', \"I actually recommend you to visit this place when it is warmer and in summer.. surely there's a beauty in frozen things but the life is frozen too .. it is super slippery and you will need cleats to go up and down..\", \"We arrived on a rainy morning--it was worth standing in the rain. Incredibly display of power, water, just amazing! Still got great photos (possibly even better ones than we'd have gotten if it were sunny).\", 'Beautiful in the winter when much of it is frozen. Worth the small walk from the road to get there. Highly recommend to anywhere driving through the icefield parkways.', 'Enjoyed a lovely walk along the falls. The water gurgled underneath the frozen ice, and gigantic icicles lined the walls of the canyon! The photographs we took did not do it justice, it truly was breathtaking!', 'We just happened to see the sign for the falls while driving and we were not disappointed , such an amazing view!', 'Beautiful location in the summer, but also amazing in the winter with the frozen waterfall. Parking lot is plowed out in the winter. 30 km from Jasper, spend a half hour wandering around and enjoy the frozen falls. Stay on the pathway.', \"If you're in the Jasper area, do yourself a favor and spend at least an hour to check out Athabasca Falls — it's one of the most beautiful places in all of Alberta!\", \"First of, it's free at this place. In fact, most of the places in Canada are free! This water fall is very beautiful, with loud thunder sound of the water running down crashing the rock. There's also a place where you white water raft for level 3 if you're an experience one. The natural rock formation is beautiful and to walk through it is quite a memory. Spend an hour or two and you'll enjoy the day.\", 'We stopped at Athabasca Falls on the way back to Jasper. It had been raining but stopped by the time we arrived. Because we left early, there was no one around and we had the place to ourselves. You can see our pictures at winenchocolate dot com', 'We spent Sunday afternoon out at the Athabasca Falls. It was beautiful walking in the snowy area & seeing the magnificent falls. It was too dangerous to go to the lower falls.', \"We went here on my Moose tour and i'm glad we did! It was a beautiful spot. We weren't here too long but we did a bit of exploring.\", \"If your looking for a quick day trip in Jasper that's convenient, beautiful and not to physically challenging then stop by to see the amazing waterfall at Athabasca\\nEven more beautiful in the winter when it's frozen:)\", 'We did this hike in the winter so part of the trail was closed due to snow and ice on the stairs. This is a great little hike to stretch your legs on your drive along the Icefields parkway. It is very pretty.', 'We had a awesome time walking down the trails to the river to take pictures looking back up the mountain. We have been in the fall and in the winter.', 'A very busy place in early fall with many tourists. Paths are paved and fairly easy to navigate for all ages. More extensive trails can be accessed as well. A beautiful must-see attraction, however I prefer less busy times.', 'If you want to experience the Rockies and their Falls this is a Great starting place. Easy access off of HWY 93, Beautiful scenery all the way to the falls. This is a great place to see in the summer and winter.', 'My husband and I loved the Athabasca Falls. So amazingly beautiful and spectacular!! Lots of areas to explore with great walking trails. The water is like no where else. Beauty everywhere. Be ready with your camera and to be visually fulfilled.', 'Beautiful views. We had the chance to raft down the Athabasca River (after the falls!) for about 10 miles. Not very scary, but the landscapes were beautiful and the guide was really knowledgeable.', \"The waterfall is beautiful but the history of the falls can be seen by a short hike to the river's past channels gives you an unprecedented look back in time and see how water can cut and polish rock.\", \"This should definitely be on your must see list. Start with the falls and then head towards the canyon. You can take steps down and then you end up at the bottom of the falls after the canyon and it opens to a beautiful rock beach with views that are breathtaking. It's dog friendly and perfect for a photographer. We were also told it's one of the best places for star gazing at night. It's busy but we didn't feel overwhelmed and I would definitely go back if we were in the area again. It's on your way to reaching Jasper if you are coming from Banff or an easy 30+ minute drive from downtown Jasper. Enjoy!\", 'It was very beautiful. I went during the WInter and everything was frozen, but with the mountain in the background, it still looks and sounds amazing!', 'Feel the the mist of spray on your face, view the rush of white water leaping down the canyon and listen to the roar of water crashing over rocks, plummeting down below the walking bridge. A great visit a short drive away from the town of Jasper, and directly on route from Jasper and Banff National Park. Stop and stretch your legs, take a bathroom break or have a relaxing picnic on a nearby bench,', 'This is nature at it best and most wonderful. The walkways offer you so many different views of these magnificent falls.', 'Gorgeous spot. This is a beautiful place for pictures, especially with the unique stairs built into the scenery. It was not crowded for me as we went right after a rain, but I can see how it would be a bit uncomfortable viewing with more people.', 'The biggest canyon and waterfall I have seen! Superb!\\nQuite accessible, mainly paved. Some areas inaccessible to those who cannot climb / scramble.', \"This is a must stop when driving along the Icefields Parkway.\\nThe scenery & the power of the water is amazing.\\nVery easy to walk around.\\nAthabasca Falls won't disappoint.\", 'We checked out Athabasca falls while we were on vacation in Jasper in December. The scenery was amazing and the trails were well kept and easy to navigate. It was pretty awesome to see the falls , nature is pretty crazy. It was about 25 minutes from Jasper and we walked around for about 45 minutes before getting chilly and heading back to the car. Very pretty location, great place to check out if you have the time.', 'The power of water amazes me. A must see if your visiting Jasper National Park. Extremely breath taking scenery.', 'You must stop here when you are driving on the Icefields Parkway. The fall is very near the parking lot. We have seen a lot of falls in British Columbia and Alberta and we loved them all !', \"Athabasca Falls are stunning, lovely walks and good paths. What spoils this area is the selfie stick tourist of which there were hundreds. They are not on the hiking path but in front of the falls not to take a picture of the falls but of themselves with a small amount of lovely blue water in the background. If you want to be shoved, kicked etc then that's the place for you! If you walk on you will find fewer people and equally stunning views.\", 'There are just SO MANY wonders of nature in the Rockies, that it is hard to even attempt to compare! This is one of those must-see attractions!', \"This is a definite must-stop on the Ice Fields Parkway. The falls are enormous and create such a beautiful detail in the surrounding rock. Take all of the paths, there are different views all over. Paths are clean and easy to walk on. My favorite part was the small lake and basin after the falls. The water turns bright blue/green and all is calm after the falls. There is a long stairwell to get down to the basin with large steps and things to hold onto. Very touristy, go early in the morning when it's chilly to grab your photos.\", \"This was a gorgeous place to stop, and I'm so glad we did. Make sure to hike down too - you could spend a good hour here just enjoying the view - which we did.\", 'Worth a half hour stop, even in snow. Easy walk along pathway with fencing, beautiful views, spectacular falls', 'If your driving the highway between Jasper & Banff, summer or winter, stop and see this place. There is some walking, but not very much, so most people can enjoy this place.', 'Very impressive Waterfalls, Good Parking and not too far to walk. Bring Camera - Excellent viewing platforms.', 'Second only to Niagra Falls this natural wonder is just plain fantastic. Easy to get to. Gentle walking trails. Plenty of parking and bathroom facility. Photographers are in their element with the landscape views and energy of the falls.', 'Been 35 years since visited last. Wonderful view, able to appreciate the power of water/nature. Kids enjoyed the walk and the different view points', 'Well worth a visit. Signposted from the road. Free parking. Takes around an hour overall. Powerful waterfall. Nice scenery.', \"We have been to Athabasca Falls many times and it is always a treat to walk the trails. Standing on the bridge you have great views of the falls and it's great for picture taking. Despite the fact that there are signs warning people not to go over the fences there is always at least one fool who thinks the rules don't apply to them. On this visit there was once again a guy with a camera trying to get the best view, standing on wet rocks right at the edge of the falls. Obey the signs so you don't become a statistic!\", 'One of natures beautiful works.The falls are ordinary but the view is amazing once the falls flow down and cut through a gorge. The nice part from the visitors view is that U get to walk through the rocks and see the falls from different points. A history of the falls is written at the various points too, which is good information.The different layers of rocks, plants etc give the closest insight into the effects of erosion over hundreds of years. A commendable part was the singular toilet amidst the woods. I must say thank you to the Jasper tourism center for its provision in such wilderness. I took my 6 year old kid there and so had the closest look into one of the best accommodated toilets I seen. Sans flush, the WC runs at least a 100 feet deep into the ground! In all its wilderness, it was spacious, clean and with enough supply of toilet paper.', 'This was a great place to stop. As well as the falls it is worth the effort to walk down the the bottom where te water flows into the river and to the pond.', 'We stopped on our road trip from Calgary to Vancouver and although time was tight, we found the waterfalls would be worth adding to our next trip as a place to spend more time.', 'Cool, cloudy day, a bit of rain here and there.....We enjoyed every second of our visit. Make sure you look up and down, go down the stairs, go down to the river edge, go for a walk by the river. Explore! You will not be sorry.Safe, well paved walk ways. Hold on to the rail at the more steep areas.', 'Very enjoyable promenade. Magnificent views of the river, waterfalls, etc. Well indicated trails. Truly recomended.', 'My husband and I from the UK have visited Canada several times over the years and I am always finding different things to comment on on Trip Advisor so this one is a long time coming.This is a stunning tourist spot, the first time we visited several years ago and on a revisit more recently. You cannot imagine the power of the water and the noise until you see these amazing falls. It is very accessible to able bodied and also to those that may not be quite so mobile so everyone is catered for to see this wonderful spectacle.Because of its popularity it can be very busy and quite crowded especially around the car park areas so be aware, and you do have to navigate crowds of people but it is worth it in the end. A must see, and one beautiful photograph I took is framed and on our wall at home, so every day, even in England we see these amazing falls!', 'Gorgeous views, easy access paths. This place is very tourist-y which is not my favourite thing but the views are too beautiful to pass up! Disappointing how some people disrespect nature and feel the need to litter. Well worth the visit, though.', \"Athabasca Falls are beautiful and an absolute must stop. I can't imagine coming all the way to Jasper and not stopping here. The Canadian Park Service did a great job designing and building the path system to accommodate all visitors no matter what their abilities. The signage was informative and easy to understand. Yes, I am sure that it can be very crowded especially in the summer. We were there on a drizzly day and it was not crowded at all. Maybe stopping in the early morning or later in the early evening would help avoid the crowds. Everyone in my family loved it .\", 'Since I love waterfalls, I had to add this attraction to the list. Lots of tourists but still worth visiting. Not far from Jasper.', 'Incredible rock formations and good interpretive walk signage. Not too far from town so go see an amazing display of the power of water over time.', 'Athabasca Falls are very popular. The trail is well maintained and an easy walk. Great for all ages.', \"I absolutely *LOVE* waterfalls, but I hated this one. You park, walk through a maze of tourist buses, navigate hoards of rude tourists, none of which speak English, and the waterfall isn't even that great. Zero tranquility here. The tour guide drivers are also miserable to deal with- they'll shove you out of the way while a family takes 300 selfies. I walked down to the area closer to the riverbed hoping that maybe that would be more enjoyable, but it wasn't really.Do yourself a favor and don't stop here- Jasper has other, much better, waterfalls.\", \"i thought I had taken a wrong turn and was so disappointed that we'd missed the falls. Kids were tired and cranky, then I come across the sign to the falls -Yay! Kids said nah, don't worry - of course mum spat the cheque and said we didn't come all this way to miss this. Got grumpy 1 and grumpy 2 out the car upon arrival and they were completely amazed, such stunning views, awesome falls, amazing how calm the water can be, then turns into a raging fall, good little walking trail, seen a double rainbow over the falls as well. We were all very happy after that to continue our drive.\", 'These waterfalls are incredibly beautiful, would definitely recommend stopping here on the road to/ from Jasper. Lots of informative signs, pretty easy access to all areas, predominantly kid-friendly. Also saw two tiny dogs in tiny coats so if you are looking to see these then this is probably one of your best bets in Alberta.', 'Not to be missed. Exceptional natural beauty. Carved by water and weather. Easy access and careful walking for everyone.', 'Although not a high waterfall, the sheer volume of water means that it roars as it plunges into the deep, narrow gorge it has carved out over time. Allow at least 1/2 hour to enjoy and photograph the falls from the various platforms providing different views. It is only a short distance along a wide, flat path from the car park to the viewing platforms at the top so this attraction is suitable for strollers and wheelchairs.It is a nice little climb down the stairs, through the gorge to the bottom for a different perspective again.Strongly recommend making this one of your stops if traveling the Icefield Parkway.', 'This is a very impressive Fall, not very far from the roadway, easy to park the car, a short distance walk is required, good for family trip. You can get real close to the fall and watch the water falling off the cliff. Nice view.', 'Love these falls, so easy to get to just outside of Jasper, pavement access, wheelchair accessible. Well, worth the short walk. I went in November and had the whole place to my self. I walked up the river as well for more beatiful scenery. Nice place to stretch your legs and get some great pictures!', \"I like that there were signs with information about the falls - a self guided interpretive trail made it more interesting. Good stop to make not far from town if you want to see something but don't have all day.\", 'Glad I had gloves and a beanie because it was -10 the morning out tour took us which make for sharp photos.Gets very busy with tour buses so go early but rug up and enjoy the thundering falls.', 'Rained the whole time but still enjoyed the trails. The views were breath taking and it was still very busy considering the poor weather.', 'Well worth a stop- pleasant stroll to various viewpoints of waterfalls and canyon of glacier blue water amongst leafy green vegetation.', 'Being right beside the highway this is an easy and worthwhile stop. This is not a particularly high falls, but the water volume going over the falls is large, and watching the water thunder over the falls can be hypnotic. There are some short trails that take you to different viewpoints for different perspectives. Whatever you do, DO NOT climb over the fences for that \"perfect photo\". The rocks get slippery from all the moisture and spray, and people lose their lives here far too often by ignoring the fences and slipping into the falls.For most visitors, I\\'d recommend budgeting 20 or 30 minutes for this stop, as that\\'s long enough to take in the views and admire the falls.', 'near to the highway and accessible for all. great views of the falls from the bridge over the gorge or from closer when clambering down the paths. some of the path is a little worn in places now and slippy when wet, but great photo opportunities', 'Beautiful falls, nice walking area. A must great stop along the way to other places. Can spend 30 minutes or hours depending on the day and what you want to do.', 'There is a short walk from the parking lot to the falls, though it looks like you could extend the hike further.', \"Very spectacular place to go. For me It's a must see place in Jasper. Very busy all year round. Bring your camera.\", \"This is close to the road and worth the stop if you're driving past. It does have a lot of visitors however and those that visit evidently aren't able to figure out what a rubbish bin is. It is scenic although there are many falls like it along the highway and amongst hiking trails.\", 'Very pretty falls which take about half an hour in total to visit each viewpoint. The force of water is very strong as the river plunges into a narrow canyon where the water then turns to a deep turquoise. The pathway and steps round the falls are very well maintained and signed. There are good barriers along the path which clearly state you must not climb over them. There is even a plaque which tells the sad fate of a boy who died. Yet whilst we were there several Chinese visitors still climbed over with their tripods to stand perilously close to the edge and in doing so in considerately blocked the view for everyone else. I asked them to move but they only did momentarily. Hopefully people reading this review who may be inclined to do the same might consider why it is not right to do so and refrain from doing so.', 'Mind blowing and fantastic.. its such a wonder it just amazes me how beautiful it is in there the crystal blue water was impressive definitely a bucket list goal :)', \"Athabasca falls are so beautiful any time of the year. It's a very short walk off the highway, you'll be pleasantly surprised.\", 'Found this falls to be one of the best on our entire trip, fantastic views. Very well presented in as much as many walkways with hand rails as required. I feel we benefitted by visiting later in the year as I can imagine this place could very easily become overcrowded.', \"I could never get bored of seeing all the gorgeous glacial waterfalls and rivers in this part of Canada, but this was just amazing, if not one of the best we saw. This is situated at the Jasper end of the Icefield Parkway and really did set the scene for what was to come!There are plenty of information boards dotted around the site, which are quite educational for the whole family. The crashing waterfall with the mountain backdrop was breath taking, but the most gorgeous and serene part was down at the bottom, where the waterfall gave way to a quieter ice blue river. Although it was freezing, I could've spent hours there!\", \"This place was an awesome place to go hiking and to take some beautiful photos, I couldn't believe how long the hikes were, which was a huge highlight in my opinion. Some of the views are from high above so if you are afraid of heights it may be best to go with someone you trust.\", 'Athabasca was my favourite waterfall of the trip... & we did a lot of water falls! The key here is to look at it from all the angles.. The other side has a great view', 'Very scenic walk. More than one pathway to walk..take your pick.All trails are marked and accessible. Safety rails line most pathways..enjoy!', 'One of the most beautiful falls that we saw during our trip. Close to Jasper town and easily reachable.', 'After doing the Cavell Meadows hike we drove down Rt. 93a to Athabasca Falls at it’s junction with the Icefields Parkway. There are restrooms and picnic tables at the parking lot. The falls are right next to the lot. The Athabasca River narrows converging its waters to form a wall of water that flows over the falls and under a bridge through a gorge. There are great photos of the falls with snow covered Evelyn Peak in the background and of the blue green waters rushing through the deep gorge as the river continues on. Did this review earn a “helpful vote?', 'We loved touring the falls. Two out of Five of us have disabilities yet we were still able to enjoy the falls by taking a shorter walk around the falls. Amazing views. Locd it.', 'Definitely worth doing. Lovely mountain views in the background. We actually saw a mink while we were there. It can get busy, but worth the visit.', 'Throughout our drive from Lake Louise to Jasper, this is the best place to go. The falls are really beautiful and we are lucky to visit it during a sunny day. However the washrooms are not very clean, so be sure to look out for washrooms whenever you can throughout your drive.', \"Didn't expect ourselves to enjoy this stop so much after three days in Jasper. We planned make a stop here on our way from Lake Louise, but decided to delay the stop until the day we drive back to Yoho, and that was a good decision, as we would not have had enough time to spend time here on the way to Jasper. The walk to the lower canyon was a lot more interesting, with the colorful and interestingly textured canyon walls, the falls, and the river at the bottom.\", 'Once again, this country just keeps on giving with scenery, absolutely spectacular. The Athabasca Falls were amazing, so much to see and take in, I would recommend stopping here for a look on your trip.', 'Beautiful thundering waters, try and explore the whole area as there are some lovely walks around that give different views of the falls.', 'Just a great spot, easy to access and nice walks along the river and falls area. Picnic areas, toilets etc and the falls themselves not huge but beautifully interesting.', \"A great place to visit. Plenty of room for all the tour buses and you. Beautiful in all ways. We saw it just after a new fallen snow and it was incredible, definitely a must see on this route. Much more impressive, in my view, than the ice fields. Oh and it's free.\", \"A must-see in Jasper! Be sure to take the walk down to the river. The place really reminds one of nature's power and beauty in its raw, unspoiled state\", 'This place is busy, but worth the trip. Nice falls, lots of water pushing through. Take the path down to the river, water is cold!', 'The color of the water was amazing milky blue. The rock formations were intriguing and highly photogenic. It is best to stick to the paths and hold on to the handrails. If the ground is slippery, it is important to use good judgment and refrain from continuing if it feels unsafe or might be too much work to get back up.', \"Spectacular falls easily reached from the road and then from the car park - several different short trails are all worth following for different views of the glorious falls and the surrounding country. If you're here you'd be foolish to miss.\", \"Easy walk in from the parking area even in snowy and slippery conditions. An extremely photogenic piece of nature and we'll worth the visit\", 'We stopped here on our way to Banff. We spent about half an hour walking from the top of the falls down to the river. Was a really enjoyable stop. Great photo opportunities as well.', \"They aren't the biggest or baddest falls, but they're pretty neat. If you take the time to read the plaques and boards you can learn a lot about the local area. What makes these falls so cool is the age of them and to see the eroded rock where the water has been flowing for many moons.\", \"We stopped here while driving through Jasper National Park, and this is a place you do not want to miss! It's simply an awesome example of nature's unique artwork. And it's right off the main highway!\", \"After going on the Maligne Lake Cruise, I still had enough energy to hit Athabasca Falls and what a Hi-light. I must have taken 300 pictures as I couldn't believe the colour of the water and canyon in the rocks that the waterfall had hollowed out. The walk down to the bottom was filled with picturesque views and I had my camera clicking at every turn. I couldn't believe how much there was to see and would recommend the trip to everyone old or young.\", \"Crazy busy place, full of tour busses. It's beautiful to see but I wouldn't want to spend very long there.\", 'We visited while on a tour out of Jasper. Its difficult not to take hundreds of photos in this area.', 'Went here as part of the icefields parkway trip. Was beautiful lovely photographic opportunities. Time allowed not quite long enough, would have spent longer. We had 20 minutes there.', 'I highly recommend this trip to anyone who visits Jasper, its a short drive from Jasper. The short hike to the falls is well worth it, I have visited the falls both in summer and winter and personally in the winter months I find the falls to be and their best.', 'This is a must stop location along the Columbia Ice Parkway. Lots of parking and easy trails to explore the area. Count on spending at least one hour checking out all of the sights. Amazing to see how the water has carved out the rock over time.', \"Didn't know what to expect, but nearly lost my camera when I looked down!!! That's friggin amazing! (Hope you know what that means?) An incredible natural demonstration of the force of water, and an unbelievable gift shop. A must see!!\", 'The falls were beyond awesome. The trails are clean and manageable and the vistas are beyond magnificent. A must see', 'Stopped off on a Brewster coach trip to Jasper from Banff. Although the falls are not particularly large as falls go it comes from the Athabasca river, a fast flowing mountain river, with a spectacular backdrop of part of the Rockies. In the river there are twenty species of fish downstream but only one above the falls, such is the barrier. Worth a visit though.', 'These falls are easy access from Icefields Parkway and are absolutely stunning. There are interactive signs to explain the history of the water flow', 'This is off the road, but well worth the stop. Stunning falls, and a nice little hike for those who want to wander.', 'Athabasca Falls are well worth a side visit on the way through with stunning scenery around every corner. The first part of the walk is fine for most abilities but the further down you go the further up you have to walk and it gets mighty steep in place especially if you take the route through the trees as opposed to walking back up the side of the falls.', \"When you arrive, you don't know quite what to expect. The trail opens up more and more of the water rushing down this series of narrow passages through the stone. It is a special experience.\", 'There are a number of falls you can visit and should think they are better seen when snow melt is at its height or when frozen. Having said that, falls are free to view (assumed you have already purchased park pass) and information boards give you an idea about how the falls formed. Accessed by short walk from car park.', 'Beautiful place to visit for a stop off and photo opportunity. Great scenery surrounding the falls. And gorgeous blue at the bottom. Must stop visit.', \"Stop by here on your drive to Jasper from Banff. It's right off the Icefields parkway. Parking was limited in August. We didn't spend a ton of time here (about thirty minutes) and were able to see the falls and go on a brief paved walk, as opposed to actual hiking. There were lots of families here and dogs too!\", 'The falls are a must. Stunning scenery. Water falls thundering hundreds of feet to the river below. Well maintained walking tracks and stairs. Park notes regarding the history and creation of the falls very informative. This was a highlight of our trip to Jasper. The top of the falls has easy walking tracks, stairs for the fitter take you lower down to river level', \"Great little place to go. Parking is close by so you don't have to walk very far. Worth the 15 minute pit stop for sure!\", \"Arrive really, really early. We got there before the first tourist bus arrived and had the place to ourselves. It is an incredible sight and amazing to see. I'm so glad I got myself out of bed to be there when I was.\", 'The rapids, waterfall and turquoise blue water cascading through the narrow crevice is really impressive and picturesque and well worth a photo opportunity.', 'Amazing scenery and nice walk to the falls. A must see when you are in West-Canada. Much more recommended than the Athabasca Glacier which was very dissapointed.', \"A sign from the highway easily points you in the right direction of the falls and it's an easy walk to the viewing area of the falls. They are thundering and are just beautiful. A great photo stop and it's free. Worth taking the time to stop.\", \"You can choose to do a range of hikes around here or just a quick stop as we didt o stretch our legs and see the falls. It's nothing spectacular.\", 'The Falls are easily accessible - an average walk from the parking on relatively flat terrain. Really enjoyed everything about our visit to the falls. They are really beautiful.', 'We visited on a day which was cloudy and a little rainy and it added to the dramatic thunder of these wonderful falls. Definitely worth it to stop there for a while and marvel at what nature will do unaided if we let it! Unbelievably, we saw people risking their lives and going beyond the barriers to take photos although the dangers are pointed out everywhere. Accidents can and do happen because of this kind of reckless behaviour and it is not what anyone would want the Falls to be associated with.', 'Called in on our way past and glad we did, quite busy but walk a short way as most visitors stop at the top!', 'Please take the time to check out the falls. The unique trails are a must see. Not so great if you have a wagon or stroller, but a relatively easy walk', 'Wonderful place to visit, specifically the canyon, about 10 minutes walking from the falls, it has beautiful stone rocks which carved by erosion millions years ago, this place is free of charge, you only have to pay the permit for Jasper national parks, worth to visit definitely', 'Athabasca Falls is a short drive from Jasper that can be done in a morning. Paved walkways around the falls area make it an easy hike. Great scenery for picture taking.', \"This is a paved, easy walk but there are some stairs. There are beautiful views of the rushing water. If you're short on time, avoid the path through the tunnel that leads to the canyon/pothole; left is where the action is. It's a popular stop for tour buses so it will likely be crowded.\", 'The walk to the falls was not difficult. The color of the water was a beautiful shade of blue. We recommend this to anyone.', 'A must see if you are in Jasper! Has always been my most favourite place - the rushing water, the carved rock and the full spectrum of greens from the trees, grass, flowers and moss.Make sure you walk the full train to get views of the falls from all points. The paved trails are well maintained and very walkable.', 'Beautiful and impressive. Just be prepared for bus loads of tourists elbowing their way to the best photo spots.', 'There is a lovely easy walk to see the falls and the river. It is a beautiful area and well worth a stop to see it all.', \"Literally! My words can barely begin to describe the beauty of this spot, located in Canada's Jasper National Park. A brief stop on Route 93 and within a short walk from the parking lot, is one of the more beautiful spots I've seen - anywhere! The turquoise water from the glacier melts in the Canadian Rockies, the river meets a narrow spot where you can see, and witness, the power of the rapids as they literally eat through the rock, creating a breathtaking sight. I've included a few pictures which barely show the power and majesty of the river and falls. I highly recommend this stop which is easily accessible to most everyone.\", 'Impressive waterfall that is easily accessible from the parking lot. There is a paved sidewalk around the falls viewpoints, as well as steps down to the lower canyon. I recommend going to the lower canyon which will take you to the river. You get a feeling of the rainforest with all of the green lichen on the rocks, the ferns and plants as you walk down the steps. Also take the sidewalk to the side view of the falls, which definitely looks different than the first view you get. The river is very wide here with beautiful mountains in the background; this backdrop with the rushing water of the falls makes for impressive photo opportunities. Warning: Do Not use the outhouse in the parking lot.', 'Be sure to explore the falls themselves and surrounding viewpoints.\\nThe water color is amazing in this place and its a very short detour from Icefield Parkway, definitely a must for those driving through.', \"A really pretty place to visit and take some photographs, plenty to see and very dramatic scenery. We were lucky enough to visit on a beautiful day and it wasn't too busy.\", 'The glacial water is truly amazing. The site is crowded with tour buses, so go early or late in the day.', \"This stop doesn't take much out of your time and is well worth it. Beautiful waterfall and viewing points of the river along the way. Easy flat quick walk.\", 'This should definitely be part of your exploration of the Canadian Rockies. The fast flowing river gushes through the narrow gorges carving out narrow ravines and waterfalls.', 'So easy to access these falls and such a fantastic sight. As everywhere we have been in the area the information boards provide exceptional insights into the flora and fauna and the history etc of the pace. If you drive the Icefield Parkway make sure you stop here. Just a short trip back from Jasper too.', 'Allow yourself a good half hour to walk around the falls area, there is plenty to see. The falls themselves are fascinating to watch that amount of water charge through, and the walk to the Lake below is well worth it.', 'We stopped at these falls for a short while on a coach tour from Banff to Jasper. Time constraints limited our visit to the top section of the Falls, where the river commences the downward path into the canyon to the lower falls and onwards. The width for the very large volume of water is constrained as it descends over rocks providing an impressive sight. As is the case at many of these good standard view points in Canada surfaced parking and clean washroom facilities are provided. The scenery is very good and warrants the short diversion from the main Icefields Parkway to reach the Falls.', 'Part of the Banff-Jasper trip, but an experience in itself. Not too far from the carpark and paths reasonably walkable without too much up and down. Good views across the river to the mountains and then of the falls themselves.', 'Lovey waterfall and worth the time to stop. Water is a great colour and the rock erosion is very interesting.', \"Don't miss this site close to Jasper on way to icefields. Really enjoyed. Water is stunning blue. Good pathways, carpark, wc.\", 'its a waterfall very pretty but nothing much to do there apart from stop take a photo and move on . very cold so didnt stay long here not sure if there is a cafe nearby or not', 'A lookout spot that is definately worth a stop on a road trip. The natural bridge is a wonderous sight and the water is so clear and blue. If you like natural beauty this is a must.', 'This falls is one of the best so make time to stop. It is an easy walk to see all the areas and do take the trip down to the end where the view is different but very lovely.', 'We arrived before 9am, way before all the bus loads of tourists started arriving. Moment of peace seeing the falls, and going down to the canyon when there was just a couple of other people around. Soon after >20++ people arrived by the busload and stomped the place. We were glad for the moment of peace and even gladder when the tourists left.', 'We enjoyed the views throughout the trails and the scenic beauty is quite memorable. A great photo opportunity stop.', \"This is another one of those stops that you don't want to miss when visiting Jasper. The views of the falls are lovely but don't miss the lower canyon...it's amazing! It's a bit of climbing both up and down but it's usually a fairly easy hike. More difficult if it's raining. Love it!\", 'Do stop at Athabasca Falls on your way to Jasper. They are stunning. It makes a really nice break in your trip. You can spend as much time walking around as you want but the Falls are well worth seeing.', 'A short walk to the fall from the parking lot, it was crowded and a bit disappointed of the size of the fall.', 'We went to the falls on the way to the Icefields Parkway. it was an easy hike and the falls are lovely', \"This was another beautiful falls that we've seen on our trip! The one thing that separates this from many of the others is it's easy access from the parking area which for people who aren't able to take a long hike may be an advantage.\", 'Nothing much to see from the carpark and I thought \"another lot of falls\", but to my surprise, they were absolutely beautiful and worth the effort. Gentle walking tracks and certainly a good place to stretch your legs and breath some nice fresh country air.', 'The falls are well worth a visit. There are a couple of short strolls around the short canyon and along the river. There is a trail that leads up and crossed the road and onwards to Geraldine Lake. Certainty worth a stop and a stroll around. Very popular and can get busy.', \"An easy walk from the parking lot brings you to this amazing view. You can walk around and get some great shots if you're into photography, or just chill on a rock (hopefully under the sun ...)\", \"If you don't stop and visit the falls on your trip between Banff and Jasper, you missed a beautiful sight!\\nAllow hour to visit, or more if you do the longer trails.\", 'Loved walking around this falls. Great place to spend some time.\\nEasy walk with a lot of different views and sites to look at.', 'We made a quick visit early, it is worth spending a little time here. Get here early because we were very soon swamped by many coachloads of visitors. did not spoil visit.', 'The are lots of average to nice waterfalls on the road between Banff and Jasper. But this was the nicest Falls, lake and rock formations on the road to Jasper, bring your camera, stay one hour isn and enjoy', 'Interesting place to visit when driving through the Icefields Parkway. Powerful falls, very impressive.', 'A popular destination so be prepared for crowds and if you can go very early or late. An easy walk to the falls, people of all ages were there. Very beautiful with stunning rock formations.', 'We saw many waterfalls on our journey, but this one and the surrounding canyons was just amazing! We spent a while there just listening to the thundering waterfall and then walking the pathways alongside the canyon walls as the water flowed through into a lake. The water was a beautiful shade of blue and was an even deeper shade in the canyon. To us, this was the highlight of the parkway and is not to be missed!', \"I liked Athabasca Falls because of its pretty mountain backdrop and magical water colour. The falls itself that exciting, but it possesses enough power to carve a gorge immediately downstream of it. The gorge becomes deeper the lower into the canyon the Athabasca River goes.We were able to experience this waterfall by doing a very short walk along its extensive and very busy walkways and bridges. These paths skirt the gorge immediately downstream of the falls. You have views on both sides and some of the interesting geology of the gorge itself.I didn't do the walk that leads you further downstream deeper into the lower canyon. I was amazed at the colour of the water, a lighter blue and milky appearance. The color impressed us and adds to the waterfall's scenic allure. A protruding rocky island in the middle of the Athabasca River actually splits up the Athabasca Falls and as a result you are able to observe dual segments from the overlooks surrounding the falls. With a little luck you might see a faint rainbow in the rising mist of one of the waterfall.\", \"Part of out sightseeing tour of Jasper. Beautiful scenery and waterfalls as they flow down several levels and create bowls in the rocks. They weren't in full flow in August but when they are it will be spectacular.\", 'Stunning falls.. Short trek and easy to get to the falls. Beautiful and serene. Glad this was in the list of places we visited around Jasper.', 'Worth the stop to take photos of these falls. Fed from Glacier melt so good water over the falls even in September', \"We stopped off at this attraction on the way to Jasper and almost skipped it. So glad we didn't! Amazing views and nice trails.\", 'Just a short detour off the Iceland Parkway are the beautiful Athabasca Falls. Promoted as small but powerful they are indeed a photographers delight. Within a very short walking distance from the main car park you encounter the wonderful Falls experience. A must see as you explore the amazing \"Rockies\"!', \"The weather was pouring down but it was still worth taking a look at this beautiful spot. There's plenty of parking and toilets and some good photos to take. It wasn't busy either.\", 'If you are a fan of waterfalls you should definitely visit Athabasca Falls! Large parking place is available for cars, it´s accesible for all ages. I´d recommend to go there early in the morning to avoid crowds since it´s very popular atraction.', \"This is a must see, don't forget you camera for this one. you will not be disappointed. The waterfall falls out from the side of the Mountain, and the views are breath-taking.\", 'Visit this place early (day break) and you have the falls all to yourself. Pack yourself a breakfast and you can enjoy the sounds of the water with your breakfast.Overall walk takes less than 30mins and entrance to falls very close to car park, no hiking required.', \"These are really easy to see. It's only a short walk from the car park to the falls. There are a number of viewing points and a few information signs.

The walk is nice and easy and the viewing platforms were excellent. Would take the time.', \"You have to visit the falls. It's obviously a bit of a tourist trail but well worth the visit. Not too far to walk\", 'This was a stunning visit and such an easy stop along the highway. There is plenty of parking with some coaches turning up too. We got there between 0930-1030 and it was fairly busy, we had got there just before a coach load. The falls have informative signs, but the power of the falls is incredible. Plenty of different areas to go to up close or at the end of the falls, which was the calm after the storm. Would highly recommend.', 'Worth a quick stop enroute. Impressive waterfall & gorge. Plenty of parking although busy. Toilets are basic.', \"Took my family who came from out of province to see the beauty of the falls. The falls are breathtaking and the colour of the water is gorgeous. You could stay there for hours just staring at them. This is a sight you don't want to miss.\", 'Dramatic and interesting and very accessible to all people. They have a wonderful system of ramps and viewing platforms including some steps down an abandoned stream bed from when the river moved. Really thoughtful and informative. We spent over 30 minutes climbing around and taking photos. It is Great!', \"After seeing so many falls in Banff and Jasper, we were contemplating if we should do this at all with a 5 yr old but our decision to check this off the list was all worth it. It's a easy walk to the falls and the view is spectacular and you also get to see spot which might be a huge falls in about 100yrs. This would just take about an hour if you are just doing the falls.\", 'We stopped here on our drive from Jasper to Banff. It was breathtakingly beautiful... even in the rain! We had a nice walk to the various viewing spots. It was busy with visitors.', \"The falls are pretty high and spectacular because of the volume of water and the narrow gorge it's pushed through. the falls are quite safe to visit, as long as you don't climb over the fence. They are also very accessible as they are only 100 meters from the parking lot and you can get very close to the falls. well worth a detour!\", 'A very nice high volume waterfall. Easy to get to with lots of viewing platforms. Would rate in top 25 of falls we have visited. In Canadian Rockies would rank it second only to Takakkaw Falls in Yoho Nat. Park.', 'You pass close by between Jasper and Lake Louise - is a great free attraction - highly recommended for all ages and pets', 'Would love to have spent more time here. Follow the river along and see the falls which were stunning and so close. The colour of the water is amazing - spend some time here.', 'Can be very busy on the afternoon but worth the stop. Would recommend a look or hike around on the trails.', 'Fun waterfalls to see. There are a lot of trails to explore not far from the parking lot. The falls were very powerful falling into the canyon below.', 'Although we knew we were going to stop here for a photo stop whilst on a tour to the glaciers we visited separately and spent ninety minutes exploring. Spend time and this natural wonder will reward you.', \"We had heard that this place gets really crowded so the advice was to get there early. We took this advice and were there soon after nine o'clock. However, there were already two coaches in the parking lot so the place was quite busy and it was necessary to push and shove in order to get a decent view of the falls. The Falls themselves are quite stunning with narrow channels full of rushing waters. The drop in level is not great but the sheer volume of water makes these quite exciting. But, oh the crowds, by the time we left there were seven coaches parked in the car park.\", 'The waterfalls was very full when we visited. Nice walk around the falls and canyon. Good photo ops.\\nCan get slippery around falls when wet.', 'We went to visit the falls mid day and it was a little busy, we were still able to get great pictures. I would suggest this attraction would probably be quieter in the morning. Very beautiful with many differnet great look out spots/photo spots. You can also walk down the old canyon where the water fall used to run.', 'If you drive from south park way to Jasper you should not miss this one. It took about 30 minutes to visit this falls.

The whole area is beautiful, but the waterfalls are just amazing! The volume of water flowing over them is truly awe inspiring!', 'Athabasca Falls are beautiful. The color is amazing. There are different levels to view the falls and canyon. It was easy enough to get there and is right off the highway and a large parking lot.', \"What a beautiful area! The trails and parking accommodate the crowds well. We took a picnic but wound up eating in the car as there really wasn't any place to sit.\", 'The falls are great, a narrow gorge with sheer rock and the green waters of the Athabasca River falling through them. The concrete walkways crossing the river give you great views of the falls and the River both upstream and downstream.Parking was tight, but we managed to park with no problems. There are restrooms.', 'Nice short excursion to see the water falls, canyons, beach area and walk around. Walk was nice and gentle. Great place for pics!', \"Close to the highway & a short walk from the parking lot. Numerous steps required to see the falls from several angles. This is one of the highlights in Jasper Nat'l Park between Jasper & the Columbia ice fields.The falls are impressive. There are two benches that memorialize two young people who slipped and fell to their death (on different occasions). Be careful.\", 'Every time we go to Jasper, we take a trip out to Athabasca Falls and it never gets old ... they are truly awesome! We usually drive the quieter highway from Jasper that can be found when you turn off to Edith Cavell.

Although not spectacular by Niagra scale they are well worth a visit especially on a dull or rainy day.', 'Stopped off here on the way to the glacier. The place was heaving so my advice is to go early as these falls are not to be missed. Around every corner is different view. Spectacular.', 'Very close to the waterfall. Impressive to see the power of the water. Impressive are the potholes created by the falls over centuries. Nice walking paths around the falls.', \"The color of the water and the depths of the canyon was breathtaking. There's lots of beautiful foliage and waterfalls.\", \"WOW. These falls were absolutely gushing. Beautiful easy trails with spectacular views. Don't miss this stop.\", \"Another natural attraction degraded by it's popularity.

Close to the main road, and crisscrossed by boardwalks the accessibility is great but makes for it's on demise.\", 'The athabaska falls are great; there are several points to be walked around and hiked around which is fantastic. We had a great time exploring it all with the kid and ourselves. At the same time its a great way to spend the energy after a good breakfast in Jasper and have kids run around for a while.', 'Great stop along the Icefield parkway just out of Jasper. Very short walk to falls, highly accessible from the parking area. Very much worth your time for a photo stop. Best photos taken in the afternoon to early evening.', 'This place is worthy of a stop on any trip past! We kept running out of time and so bypassing it but then ended up extending our stay in jasper and heading down there and to then a couple of other spots. My two yr old thought it was awesome.', \"Great place to check out when visiting Jasper with a baby. The paths to view the falls are stroller friendly and aren't very far from the parking lot (so it isn't a huge time commitment and you can get back to your vehicle quickly if baby fusses). Plus it is Soooo beautiful!\", 'During trip from Banff to Jasper we were subjected to rain, but the mountains were mainly still visible and although we understand good weather would have made it better it is hard to believe that itcoculd have been better. An awesome drive. We pulled in to Athabasca falls and when we approached the waterfalls the noise intensified and it was amazing to hear and see the force of the water. An awesome experience! Must do!', \"It's a challenging bike ride or an easy drive.... if you rent a car your not on anyone else's time click to leave\", 'we loved our visit here. Nature at its best and most powerful but why people ignore the warnings and risk their lives by going beyond the barriers is beyond me.', 'We stopped at the Athabasca Falls en route from Jasper to Banff. The car park is just off the highway and the falls are only a short walk away, and worth doing. Very beautiful falls, lots of different vantage points, great photo opportunities. Thoroughly recommend.', 'Beautiful and stunning. Many different viewpoints on site. Has lower and upper areas to be seen and of course mountains in the background.', 'Love love the fall. Do not miss it. Beautiful, powerful and magnificent. Words and picture cannot describe it.

It's easily accessible for everyone and you can get very close up to the falls as well as the canyon. This is a must see for all.\", 'These falls are spectacular and you can get so close to them. A great reward at the end of the Icefield Parkway. Lots of options for overlooks. You can take a few steps to an overlook or hike around a bit. Also, the back road out of the falls off the main highway was a nice little drive and we saw a black bear along the road.', \"This place is a MUST stop if you're in the Jasper area. I would recommend coming early or going late in the afternoon to keep away from the crowds and even then, you will not be alone. The falls area has a lot of viewpoints to look at and take pictures. You can even walk down a path where the falls used to go and look up at the giant carved away canyon walls. It is so picturesque. The falls are very close to the parking lot, so no long hike, but there are stairs you need to go up and down around the attraction. Make sure you have lots of memory in your camera for this place.

The falls are powerful and have carved quite a magnificent gorge out of the rock. Impressive to see and easy to get to (a short walk from parking). Can be slippery so wear good shoes!', 'Absolutely beautiful but very cold. There is a very good cafeteria that does a very wide range of food from full cooked to light snacks.', \"Popular falls and plenty of parking, but can be crowded. We were there early - about 9 am on a Sunday - and after about 30 minutes, the crowds started, so we had the best of the time. Access to the falls is easy and vantage points are many, to either admire them or to photograph them - and there was plenty of water. The falls aren't high compared to others we had seen, but they are well worth a visit and the walk around.\", 'Well worth a visit. Easy access and easy to move around and get good views despite large numbers of a certain type of traveller who always want selfie pictures and videos.Those annoying selfies stocks should be banned from all tourist spots as those operating them have no regard for others wanting to enjoy the sights and sounds!This is a majestic place........', 'Not far off the road are the Athabasca Falls. If you enjoy watching waterfalls this is the place for you. A lot of water traveling through a small gap. Very dramatic! Well worth a visit.', \"This is a very short trip off of Route 93.

Great pics with the mountain in the background and enjoyed the various little paths to see different views and the river basin on the other side. Plus all the beautiful erosion of the rocks created by the water. Not overly crowded when I was on my tour but assume everyone will stop here on route through the Rockies.', 'The Falls are right off the parking lot. The river has carved a sharp and fairly steep canyon. The hike to the lower falls may be even better, because you actually get a hike (really a walk) along the river to the lower falls just 3 KM down stream.', \"Go early! It's a beautiful waterfall, just off the main highway, with a pretty good drop of water. The site has a large car park, and then you can walk around the falls and take in various views.There are lots of viewpoints and photo opportunities, and if you get the sunlight correct, you will get a beautiful rainbow shot over the falls. I suggest you go early or late....we went twice and its best when seen avoiding the crowds!\", 'What a beautiful waterfall! You see the first part of the waterfall. .....and then there is much much more to see! The river cuts through the rocks making many interesting canyons with swirling water and beautifully cut rocks! The walkway is quite level, athough if you are an older visitor, you would have to watch your step in a few places as the path is uneven. We have seen this waterfall in both beautiful weather and wet weather, but it is definitely worth seeing in ANY weather!', 'Travelled from banff to jasper. The volume of water over the falls us amazing. Walked through a chute in the rocks that the river had made. Not to be missed', 'Went there as part of a photography tour with Philip Norman Photography, Australia. This wonderful waterfall is very easily accessible and wheelchair friendly. It takes about 20minutes to walk around. Good place to take photographs. Aust go visit tourist attraction.', \"This was one of our many stops in the Jasper National Park.

Our guides marl & Lyndon were very helpful and assisted us to make the most of our experience.\", \"If the sun is out, then the light isn't so good for photos in the morning.

Walk all the routes, see all the views and take lots of photos for great memories.', 'Pretty falls. The site is all paved and easy to navigate. The water is such a pretty blue. I suggest you take the short jaunt down to the river for a sideline adventure.', 'Athabasca Falls is a beautiful sight not to be missed if you are in the area. The trail around the falls is stunning, as well as the steps down to the base where you can see the river. Do not miss this place!', 'Athabasca Falls were beautiful. There were several viewing points along the very accessible trail. There were a few steps from the parking lot, so not sure if it was handicap accessible, but the falls are a short walk from the parking lot so there is no hike involved. With this accessibility also comes the crowds. Lots and lots of people trying to get pictures and such, so you will deal with a large amount of people, but definitely a place to stop and see. The power of the water is cool and there are several walking paths along the falls, canyon, and river. Nice place to spend 30 minutes to a couple of hours, depending on what you want to see.', 'Stopped off at the falls during our coach trip from Banff to Jasper. A pleasant short walk from coach park to the falls which are properly safely protected by stout paths and railings. A nice roar from these for your videos !', \"A must see. Awesome. If you like roaring water and large fabulous rocks you need to come stand, look, inhale, listen, and experience the power of nature that is Athabasca Falls. Have been here three times. Can't visit Canada without my fix of these falls. A must.\", 'I was in awe to watch the tons of waters soaring down crazy and so much fog was generated when the water hit the rocks. it sounds like thunder! You can feel the power of the nature!', \"Free falls, takes a few minutes to walk down from the car park but it's a nice way to spend a few minutes and take a few pictures\", \"One might consider that anyone who has travelled to Philippines (the land of 7107 islands) with its hundreds of fairly easily accessible waterfalls might be 'jaded' by a non-tropical, Canadian waterfall.Not the case.Athabasca Falls is attractive in its own right with a fast flowing ice blue river and a gorgeous drop complemented by a beautiful gorge-like setting.The viewing areas are very good although the timber railings appear not to have had sufficient maintenance by Parks Canada or the other responsible government authority.The falls are only a 60 metre walk from the car park off the Icelands Parkway, so they are quite accessible.Even the disabled can easily view parts of the falls.\", \"Don't miss! Incredible falls right off the highway near Jasper. The trails around the falls are easy and the water is just incredible.\", \"We visited this place first thing in morning while on the way to Jasper from Calgary. Since we were early, found the parking spot easily and then it's a 15-20 mins short hike to the lower falls. The way is mostly paved and we were able to use umbrella stroller on most of the path. The best part is viewing the falls from the little cave - that's a very beautiful experience. When we reached near to the falls, there were 6-7 people ahead of us, standing in queue to enter the cave. And when we were returning, there were about 20-25 people in the queue. I would recommend going early or in evening to enjoy the place.\", 'Trails running up and down the falls give great views from different vantage points. Plan on spending some time there and enjoy.', \"These falls are awesome and is well worth the little drive from Jasper. The falls are a short walk from the parking lot and there are various vantage points to view the them. Most powerful falls I've seen other than Niagara.\", \"Maybe because I went in a long weekend, we found this stop hyper busy, otherwise it's an absolute most stop on your way to Jasper!The path is basically everyone's friendly. Strollers, elderly, etc. As it's paved and there's a few lookouts from like almost every angle so you can admire the power of the water at this beautiful falls.There's interpretative posters everywhere were you can find fun and interesting facts about this place!\", 'Great visit.

Tracks for walks. Lots of steps if you want to get to some areas. Free car park and loos. Good waterfalls.', 'This requires a short visit as you travel down the Icefields parkway. Count on 30-45 minutes.The falls are spectacular, but even more interesting is the little footpath that leads through an old abandoned river channel to the bottom of the falls. Certainly a worthwhile stopping point.', 'Best falls and viewing points in whole area. So incredible. Easy walking. Ok for wheel chairs also. Could easily spend an hour here.', \"Stop by the falls if you're not pressed for time. I wasn't super impressed with them because I've been to Niagara falls and the ones in Hamilton, Ontario. The plus side is that it didn't take long to see and didn't involve much walking or hiking to check out. I would say this place is kind of overrated.\", 'This is a great area to walk around - the falls themselves are rather interesting. This is one of the stops on the icefields parkway that has bus parking, so count on a lot of people running about small pathways near the falls. There are pathways that lead away from the main falls and follow the river - this is where a bit of tranquility can be found, and quite recommended.', 'As waterfalls go, these were great. There was an easy walk around the top of the falls, with plenty of viewing places.', \"The falls are really close to the carpark and access is easy for old infirm and those who want to enjoy something that's very good.\", \"Gorgeous views and a short walk so very easy to get to and to take some wonderful pictures. Just like everything else here in the Canadian Rockies, you can't beat the beauty here.\", 'We drove down from Jasper to see these falls and it was well worth it.

Downside crap maps for visitors.', \"It's a super drive all the way, in fact it's beautiful anywhere and everywhere you drive around in Jasper.\", 'To be honest, this is the place I love most! whether you are looking for scenery or a short hike, Athabasca falls caters to all. Just standing by the fall, and feel the fresh water sprinkling on your face is sheer pleasure. We captured some very good pictures there. We walked around the short hike and it was a fun activity as a group.At the end, there is a stairs that leads to near the calm water collected at the bottom, and it is like a calm backwaters there. There are big rocks, so feels more rocky, but it is still beautiful. Everything about Athabasca is inviting, and as someone who has already visited 3 times, I must say, it leaves you craving for more everytime', 'falls is few minutes walk from parking area with viewing decks that get crowded. spend few minutes walking down the river and be amazed by the carved rocks where the water used to flow.', 'Stopped at the falls whilst driving the Icefields Parkway from Jasper to Lake Louise. There is a good sized carpark with facilities and it is then a short walk to the falls. It is free to see them and there are various viewing platforms and bridges etc to take photos from. If you are short of time do these falls and miss out Sunwapta Falls. Give yourself a min of 15mins but to soak up the experience 45/60mins would be better.', 'Even on a cold miserable morning outside could not dim Majestic Beauty and Rush of adrenaline one takes away from this experience. Mother nature must have been working overtime. It would be great if you could time your visit to avoid a busload of tourists were obstructing your views. Even that still makes it well worth your visit and time to see such a beautiful waterfall.', 'This is a pretty falls with paved sidewalks and interpretive signs. Not a hike and close to the road but its pretty, worth a stop.', 'A perfect stop to get out and stretch your legs and enjoy the scenic beauty on the drive to Jasper.

For those interested in seeing a bit more, there are stairs leading down to the calmer river front below.', 'Nice place to stop and stretch your legs, have a little bit of a walk and explore the falls and gorge. Going all the way down the hill gives a calm back eddy and rocky beach where you can soak your feet in the icy water if the day is hot. Does tend to be quite busy with a lot of people stopping though, we had some trouble finding parking.', \"You don't need more than about 15 minutes max to see the falls, but they're definitely worth a visit. Water. Falling. So long as you don't expect more, you won't be disappointed!\", 'The force of the water here is pretty impressive. At the time of our visit it was not over crowded. It is a good stop on your way between Jasper and Lake Louise. Our photos looked terrific. Blue sky, mountains in the back drop and some pretty impressive water falls.', 'We visited athabasca falls on our trip to the Rockies. It was a cloudy rainy day so it was a good excursion from Jasper. We had done white water rafting the day before from the bottom of the falls do it was an opportunity to see what the driving force was behind the raft!Great free trip out for a couple of hours or so from jasper.', 'This was a lovely place it was nice to see how the water had changed the rocks and there was no charge to see this mother nature at work', 'Just a short walk, but was stunning. Views were lovely and the falls themselves were breathtaking. Well worth a stop for 20 minutes', 'There are tons of waterfalls in the Canadian Rockies. Athabasca Falls is perhaps the most famous. It has paved walkways and lots of great viewpoints. It is fun and affords great photo ops.', 'It is quite well worked with the ability to see the falls from both sides and a bit further down river. Nice place to break a journey and it has all the facilities.', 'You can see a permanent rainbow form at the head of the waterfalls - the mist that is created because of the force of the water is truly amazing. Do carry something a little warmer as it can get chilly.', 'This is an up-close view of a thunderous waterfall, a geological marvel. It is easy to find, there is a large parking lot,\\nthere are several viewing areas with sturdy railings, but there are steps to navigate to some areas.', 'We called here on our first day in Jasper, its a beautiful walk where you get an insight into the history and different formations etc. The walkway gives you plenty of closeup photo opportunities and its spacious even when crowded!', \"I agree with most of the other reviewers that this place is very beautiful, but can also get very busy. If you want to really enjoy it then you must get here early. It is a nice and easy trail so don't worry about that. Just enjoy your surroundings and take in the beauty of the falls.\", 'Definitely a must do, lovely walk with great photo opportunities the falls are beautiful with the greenest of waters.', 'This place is definitely worth a spot, but as expected it was very busy when we were there on a long weekend.

Good experience for family trip', 'Beautiful Falls, Nice trails on either side of the Falls. Stairs that take you to the river/lake where we saw people tube boating.', 'What an awesome view of fast running water. It cascades over the rocks, spraying cold glacier water up reminding you of how cold the water actually is. There are memorial benches reminding you of how unforgiving the falls can be. Not a place to miss on your travels.', 'The falls are really nice, with quite a few viewing areas, so even when there are a lot of people there are many places to view the falls and the rocks that have been carved by the river. The various colours of the mosses add so much to the scenery as does the colour of the water as it rushes on its way. The falls are very close to the road, and well worth the visit', 'This is amazing beyond words. We thoroughly enjoyed the short hike down and the beautiful falls. It is more than just looking at the falls and hiking up. There are so many beautiful areas.', 'This was beautiful and a must see! The force of the water is hard to\\ndescribe. There are several viewpoints for this we did 1-4. Some incline but great trail.', 'The roaring water, the long tumbles, the whirlpools creating sculptures in the rock, and the channels that you can walk where the water used to go all lend themselves to a chance to see the power of nature at work.Truly a great place to spend a bit of time, and be amazed at the amount of water that can move through in a matter of minutes.Great for all ages and abilities', 'Keep that in mind as I rate this. It is great to watch the water flow to the fall and then turn into a roaring tumult as it heads down. Just avoid being distracted by the idiot tourists who want that wonderful picture in the most unsafe way over the barriers and on the rocks. They should get cameras with a zoom function.', \"It's only a short walk to the fall from the parking lot. One of the wonders of nature shapes through times. We were lucky to see rainbows even. You can enjoy the fall from different view points with impressive feelings.\", 'first stop from the north entrance of jasper national park, the fall is not so big but we can look at it so close and from different angles, left and right, up and down, crowded stop', 'It is a pretty waterfall, typical of the area. there are 2 viewpoints and both are easy walks.

The falls are located south of Jasper.\", 'Visited as part of a tour from Banff to Jasper. Nice un-spoilt falls so if you are passing do visit!', 'What a roar and thunder these falls make... You cannot be other than impressed. Make sure to take the walk down the lower canyon and mind the sites remembering those who did not follow the instructions and slipped on the wet rocks...When driving in from Jasper take the 93A, when going to Jasper do the same, it is a beautifull peace of road.', 'Great view and look outs.... Beautiful pathways to see upper and lower falls. Worth the stop for sure :)', 'Worth a stop, nice viewing points and pathways. There were good information boards that explain the geology and vegetation. Nice place to stop bet even Jasper and the ice fields.', \"A short walk from the parking lot, we could hear the roar and then see the spray around the water as we approached the falls. There is a sidewalk/platform on both sides of the falls, with wonderful views all around! We saw it on a cool sunny morning, with the sun streaking thru the evergreens and mountains in the background. The water is a foamy white going over the rocks exemplifying the utter force of the falls! It's a captivating site and well worth the short side trip from the highway to see!\", \"The good thing is that it is really easy to see these falls- it's right off the highway. The bad thing is that it's really easy to see these falls- so the parking lot fills up almost immediately. If you're going- plan to arrive early, or late. Don't recommend mid afternoon.\", \"Beautiful falls but not really a\\nHiking area. More drop in and take pictures and leave. Worth the stop but don't expect to hike.\", 'The falls are beautiful. I highly recommend walking upstream or down stream to avoid some of the crowds yet still enjoy the falls.', 'The place was packed when we went!

Just pull off at the sign and walk a short (less than 5 minutes) from the parking area to see the beauty of the Athabasca Falls.', 'Loved going to the falls. Make sure you have your camera, there is something about water falls that a person must capture!', \"This is a awesome sight that you must see. The trails to get around the falls are well designed and easy to get around. Great place to get some great photos. There was a many warnings for safety reasons. Apparently every year a life is lost here due to people not following the rules. We saw a little memorial there for someone who had lost his life. Pretty sad to see a young Asian lady climb over the fence to have her picture taken. Later I saw her getting into her car and I was embarrassed she was from my home Province MANITOBA. She totally disrespected the warnings and the memorial for the person who lost their life there. I don't understand why some people feel they don't have to follow the rules. It's behaviour like that that can end up in tragedy and ruin it for the others . One wrong move or slip on those rocks and you would be ground meat. The power of that water needs to be respected . Note to others , when visiting anywhere respect the rules that are in place.\", 'I like Maligne Canyon more than Athabasca Falls. To see the canyon, we need to walk some distance, while the Athabasca Falls are almost right in front of you after you leave the parking lot. There were some people water rafting which looked like fun. If it is a sunny day, you should book it ahead in town.', \"Well worth a visit - these falls were not the biggest we saw on our Canada trip but they are accessible and the water eroded rock is easy to see. It is also well worth walking down to the bottom of the falls, through an old river bed - so you really see the effects of water erosion.The down side was that, since the access is good there were lots of people - don't expect exclusivity.\", 'Breathtaking views of the falls and amazing canyon structures too. We visited Maligne Canyon and viewed the first 4 view points as we were short on time. Maligne is beautiful too but if you have time to just do either, I would suggest these falls as they offer both the water and canyon views and it is very close to the highway.', 'I thought it was a small area to watch a small fall but it is so much more than that. Once you visit and go a few steps down you really enjoy the beauty of the falls along with the canyon like formation around the area. Go all the way down to the edge of the water and enjoy another view (looking up). Some parts are very slipper and very narrow so make sure you have shoes with grip.', \"We stopped with the kids on the Icefield parkway to the Athabasca Falls and this is one of our favourite stops !\\nSecure area with kids, short walk to stunning sceneries! Don't forget to charge your camera or phone to take amazing pictures!\", 'We visited Athabasca Falls as the last stop-off on our journey along the Icefields Parkway from Lake Louise to Jasper in August.Recent rain and snowfall had maximised the volume of water flowing into the falls, and on our visit they were spectacular. The violence of the water pouring through the small falls gap was a sight to behold. There are lots of good viewing points on both sides of the falls, so that you can see them from all angles.Very highly recommended. A must if you drive the Parkway.', \"We stopped at the Falls on our way into Jasper. It's easy to access from the highway and beautiful views everywhere.\", 'these falls attracted many visitors - so try and go early to avoid the rush.

Mother Nature in all her glory will surely leave you feeling amazed.', 'A short drive south of Jasper and easy hike along the trail gives a great view of the roaring Athabasca Falls. I am impressed with how the Canadian parks insure quality trails and sturdy bridges on their trails and walkways. Here you see several vantage points for viewing and photos. The falls are impressive for their wide powerful rush of water over the rocks, not sheer height. Definitely worth a stop on the Icefields Parkway drive south of Jasper.', 'It is a beautiful set of falls, all on a paved path. Very short, I had expected a lot more of a walk. Falls are right off the parking lot, walking down to river is also very short walk. Cool to see! Disappointed with length of activity', 'There is something about these falls. I loved them. Its a short walk from the parking lot.The picture water, its force, color and sound will remain with you for ever', \"This is popular especially if buses are there. Don't despair. Give it 15 minutes and the waterfall views clear out. There are several areas to visit while at the falls. Take them all in. You can easily spend under an hour and see everything. Viewing the other areas at the falls will also be quieter. Most people cluster at the falls viewpoint and don't explore the other areas. The waterfall force is extremely strong. You are very close to the falls. Do not cross the railings and keep an eye on your children.\", 'This waterfall is on the road from Banff to Jasper. It is definitely worth pulling off the road for. There are several overlooks. Make sure to walk around the area and look for the best camera shots. There are usually lots of people here, because it is an outstanding place. Just be patient and you can work your way up to a great picture-taking spot.', 'The falls are beautiful with interesting Rock formation. The car park is 10 min walk from viewing platforms. There is a good network of viewing platforms linked by bridges allowing you to see different aspects of the waterfall and walk to the river floor. We spent about 40 mins there.', \"Been here a couple times over the years, and honestly even on the rainiest of days it is astonishingly beautiful. Don't miss your chance to walk around this area!!\", 'This water fall is not far from the town of Jasper. The waterfall is amazing and the canyon that the water flows through once its gone over the falls is a masterful piece of are created by nature. It is a must see while in Jasper.', 'A short detour off the highway lead us to this beautiful spot with some walking trails if you wanted to spend more time. Great photo opportunity', 'The falls a worth a visit we we re driving past and went in , glad we did not miss the falls. The way the water has eroded the surrounding rocks is awesome', 'We spent about an hour at the falls enjoying the warm weather.awe The mighty Athabasca never fails to impress as it tumbles over the falls. Plenty of opportunities for good pictures and a nice place to stretch your legs.', 'part of a package with trafalgar tour. amazing sight and sound, block out time to enjoy, explore and visit the bridges over the falls. we were very rushed on the tour. would have liked to have been able to \"soak it in\" a bit longer.', 'We just visited the Athabasca Falls recently and this is a beautiful site to see.

There was a lot of people while we were there', 'The falls are breathtaking. Located about 30 minutes from Jasper. The main outhouses were gross, but if you go to the end of the parking lot there are another set that were cleaner.

Just beautiful location and very interesting and easy walk to and around the falls.', 'Awesome. Loved it completely. There is a nice easy walk around the falls.

It's only about 30 minutes\\nor so outside of Jasper in the way to Banff\", 'We have now visited the falls in all four season, Will they were super strong with the spring melt, frozen in winter and now most recently in summer. They were awesome to see every time. The walk to the falls from the parking lot is quick and easy, even with a stroller. Make sure you go to all the different viewpoints and walk the trail all the way to the end as there are a great variety of different ways of looking at the falls and Canyon. Totally worth a stop as you travel through Jasper Park.', \"While in Jasper it's a must to make a visit to Athabasca Falls. It's free to check out and you can spend a good half hour to check it all out. The views and photos are amazing and definitely worth to observe and soak in. It can get a bit busy so the off season might be better.\", \"Arrived super early on journey from Jasper to Banff only 2 other cars in the car park.

Lots of parking available, plus a few short trails to walk.\", 'During warm or hot weather days, the trails and photo spots can be very busy. Try to travel earlier in the day. Best time I have found to travel here is late April, early May or the Fall before the snow falls.', 'These falls will always hold a magical place in my heart.

We took time to enjoy the views, take some pictures and read the several plaques describing the falls, river, rapids and some of the history surrounding the site.', 'As with a lot of the spots on the Icefield parkway the downside is the limited area for parking versus the number of tourists stopping. Allow about 30 minutes to explore the area where the raging waters has worn away the rock over the centuries.', \"30 km from Jasper is Athabasca Falls. It is right off the Ice Field Parkway ( Canada 93). This is the most voluminous falls in the park and the 80 foot tumble into a narrow canyon is a must see.

My only complaint is against the people that choose to vandalise such an amazing natural wonder.', 'Visited on a trip From Jasper to Banff, just a short detour required. A short walk to the various viewing areas both sides of the falls on good paths.The water has cut a path through the rock making a huge whirlpool as it goes, very impressive.

Loved all the levels you can walk to amd enjoy other parts of these beautiful falls.', \"I had very high expectations due to the reviews but still wasn't disappointed.

Took some lovely photos as the sun was shining forming rainbows. Suggest visiting in the week.', \"Athabasca Falls is Stunning! Bring your camera.

Spend an hour or two on your way through Jasper National Park.\", \"Organized for tourists, close to the road, easy access. Go early: it gets crowded mid day making the visit less enjoyable. Parts of the trail can be a bit tight and awkward. It's probably quite nice late as well, with the sunset lighting up the mountains. It rained intermittently when we were there. Didn't bother us. Always carry rain gear when in western Canada and wear non-slip hiking shoes or boots.\", 'The Athabasca river is VERY high, so this waterfall is POWERFUL. You can hear it and feel it. They have built walkways in the right place, so you can see all the different parts quite well.', 'Easy walk from the parking lot gets to the falls, great vantage points on both sides of the falls.

Allow one to two hours and bring a camera that can take video. Worth the visit.', 'Standing and feeling the spray of the water from the powerful Athabasca Falls, is breathtaking. Where does the water get such energy? The falls are beautiful and awe inspiring. There are steps down to the river which are easy to walk and climb. It is a beautiful part of nature.', 'The falls are very conveniently located right beside the highway and are within a very short walk from the free car park. The falls are interesting and the view points offer some great places to take photographs.', 'Very beautiful, liked the posts with the information about the falls. Some spots are tight to walk through', \"We had seen the falls from far away when we were headed rafting. So we were hesitant to stop on the way south from Jasper to LL. But we were traveling using a driving tour ap (Gypsy Guide - highly recommend) and the guy talked so great about it, that we decided to stop.Truly, it was very impressive. And it's great because you can spend as much or as little time here as you want. Just park and walk over or hang out longer.The falls are impressive not due to their height, but the sheer power of so much water being forced down the falls with rocky twists and turns (not a straight line water fall).The only reason for 4 vs 5 stars is I usually rank activities where I spend some time checking places out a 5 and here we went in, took some pics and left. But it's 100% worth the stop.\", 'Impressing waterfall close to the car parking, 10-15 minutes for relax and watch the water stream. In my top 10 list', 'This is a very nice falls, but it is just down a path from the parking lot, so everybody can see the falls...so everybody does....crowded.Still, it is worth a stop. The falls is wide, the water drops about 40 feet, and there are a couple of side falls which are narrower and higher velocity. The water drops into a narrower channel, so it churns and hisses as it fights its way through the rocks, and finally back to a wider lake.You can cross a bride to the other side, so photo ops abound...worth a look', 'We stopped on our way to Jasper from the Columbia Icefields. A very impressive natural sight with good vantage points even though it was very busy.', \"We stopped here as it was the number 1 rated activity in the park, but I can only conclude that 99% of people don't want to go more than 30m from their cars to get a view. This is nothing compared to the waterfalls along the Berg Lake trail.\", 'Fantastic views. Great waterfalls. You can take excellent photographs. Highly recommended. Easily accessible. Plenty of viewing points. Taken many photographs published with this view.', \"Not A far walk not far off the highway worth the time and effort to go and see it it's beautiful . Picnic places and restrooms and lots of hiking and beautiful scenery\", \"These falls are amazing. The force of the water is powerful and majestic. The gorge is beautiful. Don't miss this if you're in the Canadian Rockies.\", \"So many vantage points - I took way to many photos from each and every direction possible. It's very popular with bus tours and individuals alike. There are bathroom facilities there and signage about the area and falls. Give yourself at least 30minutes to take it in, only a short walk from the car park.\", 'Great quick stop along the highway. Lots of spots for photographers to take pictures, and a nice path down to the water.', 'The water never stops flowing. The rock shapes it creates are wondrous. This is a great place to walk and to look at how water affects geology.', 'Went to see the falls. Nice and good place for taking memory pictures of the falls. Easy to reach. The only bad thing there is the washrooms, disgusting and very bad smell.', 'Powerful waterway. Very good viewpoints for many photos from many angles. Nice stop along the Icefields Parkway.', 'We saw Moose here! It does get crowded with buses as it is a popular place. That is to be expected with most sites in the area. Plan your visit accordingly.', 'Beautiful view. Athabasca falls is a wonderful spot to stop and take a breath. Lovely spot to relax and connect to the outdoors.', 'Go, it will take your breath away, and you just may experience oneness with the universe. Be prepared!', 'We stopped and spent quite a bit of time here on our way from Banff to Jasper. Just beautiful to take it all in. Highly recommend.', 'We stopped by the falls on our way between Jasper and Banff and enjoyed the stop. The river is fed by the Athabasca glacier which is an extension from the Columbia Ice Field... the power of the river is great to see... definitely worth the stop.', 'This was a quick stop with much beauty. The guide helped us with some history and made sure we saw the falls from several angles', 'It was quite crowded and it was raining when I visited so it was hard to find a good view of the fall (if there is one). But even just at a glimpse, it was really cool seeing how powerful this waterfall is and it was quite fascinating.', \"We stopped by Athabasca Falls and hiked down to Bridge 4, and then drove to Bridge 6. As other reviewers noted, the most interesting slot and rock formations are in the first several bridges. It is always amazing/pretty to see what nature's force can do with water and rock, and that is very true at Athabasca Falls. This was very similar to Marble Canyon, which we also enjoyed. There were alot of people at Athabasca Falls, but not too many that we couldn't enjoy the views.\", \"Being around the falls area is an experience of the power and wonder of nature. The roar of the the rushing water, cutting it's way through rock faces, creating whirl pool pots is amazing and dynamic. Nice hiking paths in and around falls.area.Well worth the stop. Very close to the highway!\", 'We visited Athabasca Falls early in the morning, before the crowds ascended on it. It was a very nice walk, with interesting signage telling about the falls', 'You get to see a lot more majestic vistas if you are willing to walk along a few hiking trails in the area.

Worth stopping for 5 min if you happen to cross the general area.', 'very nice but go early in the morning , make sure your camera is charged and take the walk around the falls', 'thoroughly enjoyed the views of the falls, quite busy so have to be patient to get the good shots. Actually returned the following day at a different time. Also walked around to another part of the falls which was a nice quiet walk.', 'Beautiful Area to visit and falls are easy to get to, just a short 5-10 minute walk. The tip I have for everyone is to arrive early before the crowds get there. You can see Athabasca Falls and surrounding area in one hour.', 'Got here at 0800 on a beautiful sunny morning and shared the magical place with one other couple. Spent about an hour walking both sides of the ravine and marvelling at the post glacial power of the river and the wonders it has and continues to create. A real privalage to ba able to spend time here.', 'Great stop along the way. Lots to see and no cost for admission. Walk from top to bottom in 15 minutes or so. Kids thought it was pretty cool too.', \"The falls aren't very big, but there are violent. Quite a spectacle and worth stopping for.\\nThe trip down to the falls is pretty short, and although it can be uneven and rocky, we managed it with a stroller.\", \"This is right off the road, and requires only easy walking to view. Nice spot, but like anywhere else obey the signs and don't end up in the water. Don't need more than 20 minutes to see it all.\", 'This must see waterfall is easily accessible and very close to parking lot. You can see it off of highway 93. We stop every year!', 'A good example of what Nature can do... It will surprise anyone with interest on geography and how nature impacts the soil... Not to be missed as the water effect on rocks is to be noticed...', 'Must see if only trip to area. Quite busy as just off main highway, coach stop. Allow 1/2 hr-45 min for walk-around. Not strenuous at all. No cafe/restaurant at site. Combine with Mt. Edith Cavell hike further up same road- (more strenuous)', 'Great spectacle! Plenty of parking. Short easy walk to falls. Plenty of view points on each side from which to take photos from. Spent well over an hour wandering through this site.\\nA must see if in the area!', 'The falls are not a huge spectacular drop but are very pretty. The water is rushing so fast and has created a channel through the rocks. You can get several views of the falls by following the trail and viewing platforms. You can see the fall from the front, side, and back. There are signs warning not to get off the trail. If you should get out on the rocks and fall, you would most likely not survive because of the speed and cold of the water.This part of the Athabasca is actually considered a Class 6 - nobody has run it. The water is too fast, the openings too narrow.It is an easy walk from the parking lot to the view of the falls. Very nice.', 'An astounding place with awesome views. Thoroughly would recommend visiting here. Camera is a necessity to capture the amazing scenery.', \"These falls are nice, but Maligne Canyon is considerably more beautiful and natural. This is OK if you've got kids and need a short quick trip.\", 'Another beautiful stop! Easy walk on well maintained trails. Lots of signs warning you not to go over the fences but we saw people doing it anyway - foolish. Great photo opportunities. We went later in the day and it was still busy.', \"What a wonderful spot to take pictures. You can hike down about yards from parking to the falls. The energy of the water is breath taking. Don't miss it\", 'This was a beautiful stop along the Icefields Parkway. There is a path with various lookouts and signs describing aspects of the falls. The speed and force of the water flowing over the falls was amazing.', 'Athabasca Falls should be a definite stop when visiting Jasper National Park! It is an easy walk to the falls from the parking lot and there are numerous viewpoints from which to see the falls. The power and abundance of water it amazing!', 'Lovely, powerful waterfall.

We beat most of the crowds and enjoy the powerful water flow, falls and the carved out canyon and the stunning scenery.There is excellent paths and signs here that navigate you above the canyon and if you have the time to the end of the canyon.Worth the visit but get in early.', 'Plenty of good viewing spots for these powerful falls not far out of jasper. Went there after seeing the glacier that feeds them.', \"I've never been this close to Falls moving at a massive speed as this and with such force.

The lighting also enhanced the photos we took.', 'Athabasca Falls is definitely worth a stop. There are many lookouts to view the raging flow of the Athabasca River carve its way over the rocks. Not only are the falls quite spectacular, so are the rocks that have been sculpted by the force of the water.', \"This set of falls will really give you a feel for the power of water. The paths surrounding the falls are quite extensive getting you very close to the water and providing lots of different views. Free to see.A bit busy during the busy season but that's how the whole area is in July.\", \"Beautiful iconic spot in the Rockies. Always busy but it's because of the outstanding waterfall. Parking can be tricky when busy.\", 'We charged around this attraction after a day on the icefields. We wanted to see where the melt water went.The falls itself is a massive fury of white water that is terrifyingly beautiful. We rushed around it because of a timing issue but it was an awesome sight that warranted more time.', 'The falls are a must see on your trip from Jasper to Banff. Its a short easy walk. It was more spectacular than we expected.', 'Very nice, the canyon is a wow, nice boardwalk makes viewing safe and easy, The morning sunlight was difficult for photos, I would recommend visiting later in the day for best effect..', 'Stopped here on our way to Jasper. Have been here many times and I am always impressed by Nature. Truly beautiful and breathtaking to see. A short stop will provide you with great pictures and a true appreciation of the great outdoors. Take some time and make this a stop on your way to Jasper or on the way home.', 'We stopped here for a stretch. It was a nice walk with awe inspiring views. Beautiful location but a very busy stop too, so expect lots of people!', 'We stopped here briefly while driving from Jasper to Moraine Lake. The falls are spectacular and well worth the stop. Hard to describe their power. You could stay longer and do the longer walks but sadly we were pressed for time. Well worth a visit and free of charge.', 'The falls get very busy but they are worth going to visit, the path the water has cut into the rock is amazing, like all parks in Canada it is well maintained and easy to access and good parking.', 'We visited a number of falls in the Rockies and this was by far the most spectacular and the most interesting. Not difficult to access.', 'These Falls were not on our schedule, rather we came across them on our drive from Lake Louise to Jasper. So glad we made a quick detour as they are wonderful to see! There is a delightful trail that guides you around this beautiful natural wonder when you can marvel at the shapes & canyon drops in the rock face. There is a car park nearby and you can spend as much time as you like on the trail. Highly recommended..', 'These falls are absolutely magnificent! The immense power coming from the falls is spellbinding. A tru must see!', 'Go to Athabasca Falls...even if you only spend 20 minutes! You will understand the power of Mother Nature and water. It is awe inspiring!', \"What is striking about the Athabasca Falls is really how close you can get to it. It's and easy walk from the parking lot. Half hour to 45 mins is a good time to see the whole of the falls.\", 'What an amazing view! The power of water is incredible! After walking around the falls and checking out part of the trail, we were amazed. So glad that all the safety measures are in place for people to stay safe around these powerful falls. Rock climbing around water is so dangerous!', 'Great views. Very accessible. Multiple view angles on beautiful falls and river. We enjoyed it very much. Close to the I93 but rake the rural road one way - is also nice', \"We had a quick stop here on our 2 night stay in Jasper. Was very happy that the falls were so close to the parking lot and we didn't have to walk very far. Stunning views and colours of the water.\", 'wonderful views and worth seeing. But, enjoyed the Maligne Canyon walked a bit better: fewer people and saw more wildlife there as well.', 'Very nice falls, lot of viewing area, lot of informations, parking could be issue in afternoon. Canyon is nice too.', \"Another one of the 'must see' natural wonders of the area, so be prepared for tour buses and lots of tourists taking selfies. Take your time so you can go to a less busy part of the area until the tour bus crowd moves on - they usually have a set amount of time so take a bunch of photos then keep moving. Follow the paths down to the river at the bottom and around to the far side of the falls where you'll often see a rainbow form in the spray. It's a beautiful area and you can see how the water has carved different routes through the rock over time. Signs explain how the area has changed over the years and there are plenty of viewpoints for stunning scenery.\", 'Can get very busy, so finding a parking place can be difficult, but well worth it. Falls are spectacular and can get some great photos.', 'A very impressive piece of work by nature where a creek cannons through a narrow gap and splashes out. Plenty of spots for great photos.', \"We visited many, many waterfalls when we toured the Rockies and I have to say this is one of the best, if not the best. It was certainly the most powerful waterfall we saw by a long shot. It's an excellent short stop on the Icefields Parkway. It won't take long, 30 mins to an hour tops. If you are looking for a more immersive experience, Maligne Canyon provides more variety than Athabasca Falls. You might want to wear a jacket when you visit here as you will likely get sprayed with mist. My camera got a bit wet trying to get some of the more close up photos. That being said, make sure to get there early. We arrived at around 8am and it was nice and quiet, by the time we left at 8:45am or so, the coaches started arriving and we scampered. The same can be said for most attractions on the parkway, you want to be setting off really early!\", 'Good information on boards as you walk round and plenty of vidwing places. Great photo opportunities', 'The force of these waterfalls was downright gobsmacking. My mouth was on the floor. This is definitely something to see - a waterfall fed by purely glacier water with a seemingly never ending stream of water. There was also a rainbow.. so gorgeous!', 'Impressice Waterfall close to Jasper. Lots of people, of course, but also lots of parking. No entrance fee.', 'Just off Rte 93 about 20 minutes south of Jasper. Take a 45 minute stop when passing Athabasca Falls. The power and beauty of these falls is worth taking some time out from your travels. I actually drove down from Jasper just to see the falls. Great pictures as the water drops to canyon floor below.', 'Beautiful, but we chose to forego the throngs of tour buses and crowds for less crowded sights. Disappointed. Parks have added different advantage points in order to view the falls, which is helpful.', 'Love visiting these falls. Go each year as we camp at Wabasso. There are many viewpoints to take pictures from. Fun to go all the way down to see the rafters take off. Amazing to see nature at work', 'Just a great place , close to nature. Well worth a stop here. Close to the main road. Nice for picnic stop. Stone beach area beyond the falls fun for kiddies to explore. Lots of info about the Falls for the readers among us. Good half day trip.', 'Well worth a visit although the area gets crowded and you need to be patient with the crowds from the coach tours who take photos from every angle. Definitely the most impressive falls in the area.', 'Very impressive falls with easy access and plenty of parking, well worth a visit, an easy drive from Jasper.

It is very easy walking, making it accessible to people of all ages.', \"Lovely place to stop by. It was busy, but the scenery was worth it. Look for the rainbow, as the sun comes through. We enjoyed the beauty. People are crazy,though, and go behind barriers. Don't do that!\", 'Enjoyed the sites but a bit busy when we were there. Ample parking and toilets available. very pretty', \"Very brief hike to see some amazing falls. It was busy but seemed set up well to handle the people. Easy & quick to check it out if you're driving by.\", 'Worth a visit just to see the power of a river squeezed through a narrow gap.As our North American friends are prone to saying, \"awesome.\"There\\'s no admission fee, a free car park ( which can get crowded) and toilets.So there\\'s absolutely no reason not to visit this fabulous natural spectacle.', 'It is a wonderful waterfall, but unfortunately the park had to build too many concrete walkways and bridges around it to handle all the people', \"This is so easy to get to that it should be on everyone's itinerary.\\nOne of the best falls in either National Parks\", 'This is one of those places for your bucket list. Truly awesome, nature at its most spectacular. A gorge with fast flowing icy water that ends in a turquoise pool, and the noise is amazing. Slippery ice under foot !', \"The falls are beautiful and worth a look but there's not much room from which you can get a good view and when we went - a Thursday afternoon in August - it was very busy so I'd suggest this as a brief stop off rather than a day-trip destination.\", 'We were lucky enough to stop her on our tour amazing water falls just to stop and listen to water coming down crystal clear amazing .', 'Not breathtaking but beautiful. Super crowded. Fun to walk along the various trails. Good parking. Filthy dirty nasty bathrooms. Easily accessible by RV. Quite popular stop.', 'Don\\'t miss these falls. The sheer volume of water in the summer makes this what the word \"awesome\" was invented for. Easy walk even for the less mobile. Very accessible and safe for kids to see (safely fenced off\". 30mins and you are done. But worth the detour.', 'As a traveller.who have been to Niagara fall many times, I did not expect another fall could draw my attention. However Athabasca fall definitely worth your time. The view is spectacular and you can actually see the fall from multiple angles which is a huge plus. Highly recommended.', \"I saw that this was the #1 rated thing to do in the park, but we went to Maligne Canyon the day before and I couldn't imagine how anything could be better than that. But this was! A man was there with a wooden flute and played some music for us. Such a delightful time! The walking is not too strenuous, either.\", 'We were so close to the raging two-pronged Athabasca Falls that the sound was thunderous. All along the walkways, we saw and felt the force of the water as it plunged and squeezed into a narrowing cavernous pit and then into a lake that soon became rapids. Niagara Falls may not have another rival in Canada, but Athabasca Falls could be its awesome little sister.', \"Athabasca Falls was my favorite falls in Banff or Jasper 40 years ago and still is. Don't miss it for sure!\\nIf you like falls, don't miss Marble Canyon just on the other side of the Continental Divide in Kootenay Natl Park.\", 'Not a long walk, but lots of information along the way. Wonderful views of the canyons and falls. Make sure to go early or late, it does get crowded with bus loads of tourists.', 'Beautiful place to visit. Absolutely stunning views and a nice walk around the site. Lots of parking as well.', 'Biggest falls seen in the area. Plan to arrive before 10 am before parking lot is full or after 4 pm when cars leave. Keep camera close to avoid water spray.', \"Like always, God's creation is amazing. Self guided tour allows you to do what you want. It can be easy or hard if you want.\", 'We stopped here while heading to the columbia ice fields - nice little stop in the day! the falls are great and the foot paths are well maintained.', \"These stunning falls are right next to the road so of course they're crowded with people most of the time during the summer. Worth the trip, yes, though I would encourage those who can to venture a bit farther than just the area around the car park.\", \"Very touristic place, there are other falls to visit. The Athabasca Falls are worth a visit though, they're beautiful and large.\", 'The water is very clear and the scenery is simply stunning. Go early in the morning to avoid the big tour buses.', 'Mixture of power and beauty. This is a must visit to see crashing waves and stunning beach front at the bottom. Really good to match it with Mount Edith Cavell.', 'Nice visit, just around the corner from the road. When you are in the parc, do not miss it! You will be rewarded with spectacular views.', 'So glad we stopped here. The falls were amazing. There were bridges and walking paths all around the area and a walkway down to the bottom. Down below was s perfect place to take your shoes off and wade in the river. I paid to go on the Skywalk and this was free and so much better', 'This place gets crowded but it is a must stop along the road. Easy paved walk to roaring waterfalls.', 'Only just off the main route through Jasper National Park. Good views of the falls and interesting information boards at points along the gorge. We went across to the rapids on the other side of the road and were entertained watching people set of for the white water rafting. Well worth a visit but try and get there early in the day.', \"Beautiful stop! Spectacular scenery! It was so beautiful and breathtaking. The walking paths to the falls were very convenient and safe. Don't miss this stop!\", 'Athabasca Falls is not a quick stop. Plan on at least 30 minutes to wander the trails and take pictures from various locations. It is a lovely stop, and much less crowded than further South around Lake Louise. Stay on the path and behind the fence. Memorials to those who did not can be found near the falls.', \"The falls is beautiful and and an easy walk for both young and old. Excellent paved & wooden trails allow you to walk all around the falls and see it at many angles. We went when it was lightly raining which did not distract from the beauty. The falls at the top is powerful and you'll get covered with the spray, it continues on down the mountain with tunnels of swirling water. If you go at high season get there early or late to really soak it in. A 'must see' in the Rockies!\", \"Magnificent scenery and well worth the stop off the Columbia Icefields Parkway. They are not huge falls, but they are beautiful. We were advised to go either early or late in the day to avoid the masses of people and we did go prior to 11am, so the crowds weren't too bad yet. The parking was not yet full at this time.\", 'Easy walk, paved, with great views of the falls. The water thunders, creating lots of spray. It is certainly worth the stop off the ice fields parkway.', \"Several people recommended that we not miss the Falls. They were right and we were not disappointed. They are powerful and easily accessible. As you walk along the trail, there are many great vantage points. Feeling the spray and hearing the roar of the water are breathtaking. Don't miss it!!!!\", 'I feel churlish giving this awesome sight a rating of 4 instead of 5, but the simple truth is that the enormous number of visitors significantly detracted from the experience. We got there about noon and could barely find a parking space. Moving along the paved trail feeling rather like part of a cattle herd, we often had to wait for a spot at the railing from which to survey and photograph the cascading falls surrounded by lush green trees and blue mountains. Yes, it was all worth it, as you will see if you click on the pictures I\\'ve attached. But a word to the wise: get here early or late for a more intimate experience. Even better, try to plan your visit somewhat outside (before or after) the busy summer season. We didn\\'t have that flexibility so just made the best of it. You can too, and still bring back very pleasant if not ideal memories of this beautiful waterfall in its impressive setting.If your timing isn\\'t flexible and you hate crowds, you might consider skipping the falls and heading instead to the nearby Leech (sometimes spelled Leach) Lake picnic area. You won\\'t find rushing water, but you will find still water with simply amazing reflections. I\\'ve attached one of the numerous pictures I snapped there, where we were the only visitors and so enjoyed the kind of solitude most conducive to contemplation of nature\\'s wonders. This lovely picnic area would also make a wonderful spot to stop before or after your visit to the noisy, crowded falls. So you might build a picnic lunch or a snack there into your schedule. There\\'s a dock for swimming or boating too. We just stumbled over this magical place on the way to the falls, so wanted to be sure to let you know it is \"out there\" if you\\'d like to take advantage of it while visiting Athabasca Falls. It\\'s located on 93A just before it rejoins 93 right by the falls.', \"This is a must not miss waterfall even if you've seen hundreds of falls. The power of the water is unbelieveable.

Car parking next to the falls.', \"The incredible power of the water! It was a rainy day when we went but this didn't spoil the amazing scene.\", \"We have been there in the rain and it was worth it. It's impressive how the water seeks it's way down through the rocks.\", 'Pull over and be prepared to have your breath taken away. A force of nature meets a stubborn landmass and wins, but you can walk back in time along one of its previous attempts to overcome.Genuinely awesome!Please be careful, both above and below the falls. Death has many smooth-talking dealers around here from coy but slippery rocks above to proud yet weakened outcrops below. All of which entice you with the pleasure of being their first human to try and yet have lured many a stranger into their riverbed!Sweet dreams are made of this by mere mortals such as we', \"Don't miss stopping at these falls if you are driving through the the ice fields.

Very easily accessible and if you follow the path you can get very, very close to the bottom area of the falls.', 'We visited the Athabascar Falls on the way to the Columbia Icefields. Not massive but extremely powerful they are worth the trip. Some great photo opportunities.', 'A little walk off the beaten trail but the falls are well worth it.

I suggest seeing before you walk the ice\", 'This is the must visit if you are going to Jasper. The serenity of water fall sound and the beautiful Canyon. Few meters walk and you are right at the fall. Jasper and Banff is been blessed by nature. Abundant falls, lakes and canyons. This is one of the largest fall you visit without a hike.', 'Along beautiful Icefields Parkway. Good stop easy to see. Hiking id you want or just go to three bridges for great views of the falls.', \"The roar of the water was amazing. There's a small trail that will take you down to the river, but first you cross through the channel that the river used to run through! The rocks in the channel are great for photos!

The sheer power of the falls and how close you are make this special. The safety touches are very cool.', 'Amazing canyon and waterfalls. Such an interesting place it was bound to be busy and it was! As with all natural attractions in Canada it is well presented and spotlessly clean. Some quite pushy tourists about so keep your elbows handy and watch your step if the paths are wet!', 'Not to be missed. You can often see a rainbow in the spray from the falls. Best access is from the Icefields Parkway road, as the 93a from Jasper to Athabasca Falls is in a very poor condition.', 'If you get a chance to stop for a visit, do it! The setting is stunning, as are the beautiful trails alongside the river / gorge.', 'I stopped at the Athabasca Falls to look around and take some pictures. It is spectacular and well worth taking the time to stop.', \"Ok... Don't spend all of your vacation for this. But it's a good 45 minutes to see somethings good.

A relatively short walk, very easy, but a must see place! The falls are beatiful and very powerful.

It's absolutely worth the extra drive out of Jasper. It's beautiful!\", \"This would have got 4 stars but in July it's way too busy. I have visited this fall in all seasons and it's worth a quick stop and toilet break. It's free, and outside of summer, it's a relaxing little walk and a good selfie photo backdrop.\", 'These are a condensed version of higher and larger falls. Here you can really get an idea of the way canyons are formed. The layers of rocks cut through by the sheer force of the water, potholes bored into the curves of the lower end.This is Hydro Power in its untamed glory.', 'Stop over for an hour or so while on the highway. Short walks to all views of the falls. Can be visited from jasper townsite also.', 'Stunning views and the sound of the water is amazing! Walk down the old spill way to see where the falls runs off. Hard to get down to the lake with a young child but the view at the bottom of the spill way is enough.', 'Not as good as other waterfalls in Banff/ Jasper but within 200m reach of the car park. We spent time walking around the old falls also so it took 40- 60 minutes.\\nFree and easy to access for all', 'We visited with friends who live in Canada, despite setting the falls many times they keep coming back and we can see why.Good parking and a great rest break on the journey from Banff to jasper this is an amazing view and the view points they have built are not intrusiveWould suggest you visit on a sunny day as the spray from the falls becomes iridescent.Pete', 'Stopped here for 30 minutes on our tour what a spectacular place, one of many things we have seen in this area', 'When you go to Jasper the Athabasca Falls are a must. Wear comfortable shoes for the small hike. But the falls are worth seeing.', 'We LOVE waterfalls. This was right near our hostel so not only did we enjoy the falls, we journeyed a bit up the path to the river leading to the falls. Here we napped on the rocks in the sunshine surrounded by mountains & NO TOURISTS. Give it a go. Enjoy the falls, be mindful of the memorial for the fella who lost his life, and spend some time on the river, relaxing before the next stop on the way.', 'This was our second time to the falls. The falls are loud and beautiful. On the downside, expect heavy crowds. Things have changed a bit since our last trip. There are now signs posted throughtout telling people not to be \"stupid\". Its not the parks fault but on stupid visitors.', 'Like many of the short hikes we did in Jasper, the Athabasca Falls trails gave us a wonderful variety of views. We saw the falls in July and the amount of water was awe inspiring. We also saw it in pretty steady rain and would still recommend stopping.', 'Enjoyed the falls . Great picture opportunities. Worth stopping along Icefields Pkway for this one. Enjoy!', 'The waterfalls is within easy reach from the car park. It is on the way between the Columbia Icefield and Jasper - about 30km to Jasper. The roar of the waterfalls is simply majestic. Not to be missed.', \"It's a nice waterfall with viewpoints on both sides and some paths through the old channels. The views downstream are nice as well.\", 'Along the Icefield Parkway another amazing stop and see. Would suggest stop along way as we went past it and drove from Hinton back an hour plus ride back. Simply amazing view and place', 'These falls are so beautiful and different from others in the area in that they have created cylindrical craved areas in the rock formations.

Follow the walkway to get different views and make this one of your stops on the Icefields Parkway', 'Easy hike. Beautiful scenery,even on a rainy day. Well worth the trek. You can easily spend half a day here.', 'What a lovely sight as you r driving down the highway. These falls are so close to the road and so good to look at.', 'Powerful falls, so hold onto your kids. Beautiful viewpoints, though. Take the time to stop and walk around this area to see the falls.', 'The walk along the river lets you see the full power of the river and there are helpful signs explaining the geology of the river and how it has shaped the landscape. The sight is busier than Sunwapta Falls just along the road and the photo opportunities are less', 'Worth a car drive to see torrenting waterfalls and river canyon. Need Park pass to enter area but lots of stunning scenery wherever you look. Avoid when buses turn up!!!', 'Very busy site on the way to the Columbia Ice Fields. Does require some walking to get to, but well worth the walk. It is hard to grasp the scope of the falls and the speed of the water rushing through. Very pictureseque!', \"This was beyond beautiful. Everyone needs to stop there. You won't ever forget nature at its best. We had read about it, but words just tell it all. Hope everyone gets to see these Falls.\", 'A well laid out public access.

Powerful waterfalls, easy access, another symbol af the Candian Rockies\\nGraet for people from all ages including kids', 'If you are driving from Lake Louise to Jasper watch out for the police trap waiting you after the Ice Fields. The speed changes from 90 to 50 and you are going downhill. There are 4-5 police pulling people over. I thought it was an accident so many cars were on the side of the road. Way to welcome visitors CANADA.', \"These falls are huge. They're easily accessible from the highway and there's nothing strenuous about the walk around them, they're definitely worth a stop for photos. On a hot day its great to feel the spray coming from them and some good picture opportunities.

It was one of those rare moments when the place exceeded the hype surrounding it.', 'Definitely bring your camera. You can walk around the falls.

The are a few viewing bridges where you can stand and watch the falls thundering down as well as a well deserved selfie or family photograph. it is nature at its best. There are well marked trails telling you where to stand and where it is dangerous to venture. Highly recommended.', 'Located in Jasper National Park (30 kilometers south of Jasper town), this is a powerful and picturesque waterfall.

Some steps are narrow and steeply, but overall is ok for everyone.\\nThe fall itself is not so big, but water stream is very strong.', 'A beautiful place to visit. Somewhat crowded when the busses are there. Worth every step of the way of your self guided tour', 'Amazing display of the power of water. Due to easy accessibility, can be crowded with tour buses.

Great waterfalls and canyon. I especially liked the steps down the small canyon that had once been the route for the river that ran under the main road bridge. Note when exiting the car park - don't believe the sign that says that the 93A route is not surfaced - it is - all the way to Jasper.\", 'Take Hwy 93 and not 93A to Athabasca Falls...it will be much faster. Parking was convenient and the trails around the falls was nice and easy.', 'My husband and I did a day trip from Jasper to The Athabasca Falls, Sunwapta falls and viewpoints in between. Athabasca Falls were impressive and the scenery was lovely even on a grey day.', 'Beautiful falls with nice walking path through a canyon. Amazed at the power of the water cutting through the rocks. Mountains in the background make for some great photo opportunities', 'Like everything else in the area this was dramatic.\\nBrewster Tours are highly professional and know the area.', 'It is easy access to get to view the falls from different angles just steps from the parking lot.

Check out the lower part of the falls Good place for a picnic', 'These falls are impressive both in the power of the water, turbulence in the basins, and beauty of the rocks alongside.

Lower canyon has nice views on the river! Liked it better than Sunwapta falls. Esp nice just before sunset', \"Definitely a place to stop off at on your trip from Banfff to Jasper. Extremely popular so if you can go early or late you won't have to jostle for the best photo spots.\", 'The best part of these falls is that they are accessible to all and that there are many viewpoints. We saw a rainbow right over the falls that seemed magical. Just get there early bc parking fills up quickly and like all these natural beauties, the less people around the more beautiful it seems.', 'A beautiful way to see the Canadian Rockies nature taking its course! Powerful water rages through ancient rock makes this waterfall worth seeing', 'One of the many beautiful stop off points along our trip through the National Park. There is a stunning backdrop to these falls. Please take the time to stop and visit.', 'Incredible torrent of water pounding over the rocks with enormous force. You get a new appreciation of the power of water. (At least two benches on the banks with plaques dedicated to young men who decided to get off the excellent boardwalk viewing areas to get close to the water, and paid for it with their lives.) Easily accessible from the park highway, and well worth a stop.', 'My favourite place I visited In Jasper and Banff National Parks. The colour of the water is so beautiful and its so majestic and powerful. It looked like there were loads of beautiful trails around too. You can look at it from different viewpoints and you can walk down to the river on the otherside that it leads too as well. Definately will come back again.', \"It is fascinating to see the way the rock flour and silt from the Athabasca River has carved out the rocks. It's breath-taking and worth-while the stop as you travel down the Iceland's Highway\", 'Beautiful views and narrow walkways with the water cascading through the gorge at all angles.

At 8am you will have the carpark to yourself, after 10..good luck finding a place...to park or stand.However I was a little disappointed as I thought Id see a more vertical fall. White Water Rafting on the other side of the falls was fun, and a good class II rapid.', 'Stand next to Mother Nature’s fury and experience the full force of Athabaska Falls. The rushing water exudes an overwhelming sense of power both visually as well as in the cool mist and near deafening roar. The recreation area also has some paved walkways that wind through cavernous conduits over the runoff from the falls, leading to a platform overlooking where the canyon flushes out into a wide river again. We stopped at Athabasca Falls on a whim during a road trip through the Icefields Parkway. This is well worth the pull over and a spectacular sight. We were there during the busiest part of the season – mid-august – and consequently a hoard of tourists had also flooded the lookout decks. Seems like everyone wanted to take excessive selfies and photos next to the falls, which really created an annoying bottleneck of self-absorbed tourists flashing absurd poses behind cameras. Tried not to let that ruin the experience. My girlfriend returned in early April this year and said it was less inspiring because the spring runoff had not yet begun. The falls were half frozen and hadn’t reached the full potential of water flow, so my suggestion would be to go later in the summer for the full effect. Pros:-Spectacular natural showcase of a river waterfall-Easily located in a pull-off on the north section of the Icefields ParkwayCons:-Tourists. Tourists everywhere.', 'not a hiking trip, but an accessible little waterfall with the Rockies around. ON the way from Jasper to Banff/Lake Louise, close to Jasper. So one could easily do a quick trip from Jasper to see it.', \"Nice set of waterfalls, easy walk. Impressive falls, but not quite as nice as Sunwapta. There are several viewing platforms, some that let you get quite close and feel the mist of the falls. There are a couple flats trails around the falls area if you want to spend more time here, but personally I'd make it more of a quick stop. It was a very nice stop along the icefields parkway, but I wouldn't plan on spending more than 30-45 minutes. I'm not sure why it is ranked #1 of things to do in Jasper. Spend a little less time here, and more time the Horseshoe lake which is a couple minutes away.\", 'Great canyon rock formations and powerful fall! On highway 93 so that you can just stop by for 15 to 30 minutes on the way to Jasper or Lake Louise.', 'These falls are amazing, lots of water and very loud. Easy to park and not much of a walk to reach the falls. There are plenty of vantage points for photos, each viewing spot was just as impressive as each other. Well worth visiting', 'Athabasca Falls is a must stop, easy on/off from Icefields Parkway and only about 3040 minutes south of Jasper. Worth a 30-60 minute stop regardless of the weather. great viewing from both sides of the Falls', \"This is a popular and crowded stop but it's worth doing.

Another great spot to take a break along the Icefields Parkway!', 'Stunning location easy to get to from car park although if you want to walk further lots of steps up and down.\\nThe waterfall is beautiful and the sort of place photographers will love.\\nQuiet busy so early morning or evening would be good', 'Our experience of these falls was quick and impressive. A quick pull off of the highway and a very short walk to the falls. There are many different vantage points, with good signage and information. The path continues through an old canyon carved by the falls many many years ago and opens to the calm river downstream.This is well worth the stop!', \"On our trips to the Rockies we have passed this. On this trip we stopped and I'm so glad we did! WOW! The walking path is perfect to enjoy the noise and grandeur of the river as it drops thru canyons along the way. There are many scenic places along the way. Most of it is accessible by all. Definitely a place to see!\", 'This is a very easy walk appropriate for almost anyone. I did see a couple of people with crutches and a wheelchair. Not quite sure they could manage the back side which is where the best view is.Glorious waterfall with a incredible feel. the sound of the rushing water and the carved eroded rocks are amazing.', 'Spectacular sights and sounds . So glad we stopped . Busy but plenty vantage points . Easy access off highway and easy parking . Well worth a look', 'Alot of people here, but we still enjoyed the falls. You can view at different levels and also walk to the canyon/river part of the area. Worth the stop.', 'Worth half an hour to visit these falls off Highway 93.\\nEasy access from the parking lot and not a long walk. Options to go to the lower falls which takes more effort, and probably not worth it!', 'Always a favourite. You can hear the falls before you see them. there are many vantage points where you can view the falls from different angles. On a good day in the canyon to the left of the falls you can see a very distinct rainbow, worth the wait when it is crowded. The walk down the canyon gives an indication of the changes in the terrain showing the layers of rock laid down through the ages.', 'The falls are easily accessed from the car park so, this is a popular stop for the tour buses. It is lovely here and the river and falls cut a nice gorge into the slow moving flat part of the river.I was more impressed with Maligne Canyon but this is quite beautiful as well.', 'always a magnificent view worth the walk from the parking lot. a shame they cannot make a larger viewing area with all of the people that come to see it. closer parking for elderly and handicapped would be very nice. why should only tour buses park closer.', \"You arrive and first see the falls from the top. You then move down from the falls and have the option to see the falls from the other side. This waterfall is very narrow with nice rock formations on both sides. Very powerful and just hope it's not raining when you visit.\", \"Yes, this is one of the places tourists flock to, but since we'd hiked and driven all over Jasper and managed to avoid swarms of tourists, we didn't mind too much seeing these awesome falls. Of course, it would be nice if people had a clue and didn't monopolize all the views while they took 95 pictures and selfies, but that's tourists for you. Definitely a nice stop to get out and admire the canyon and falls and then be on your way.\", \"We went early in the morning (about 8AM) to try and avoid the crowds we had heard about. It totally worked as there wasn't even a tour bus in the parking lot. It's a short walk from the parking lot and there are many viewing areas where you can get some great pictures or just stand and feel the power of nature as it roars past you.\", 'This falls was powerful and swift, a short walk from parking lot. You must stop here and see this awesome force of nature!', 'There is a large free parking area. It is a short walk top the falls. There are good viewing areas.

It's an easy trail that unwinds to reveal stunning views and a truly beautiful waterfall.\", 'Definitely a highlight along the Icefields Parkway that warrants a stop. But, being so accessible from the road, prepare for crowds especially at peak hours. I think a lot of people make the drive a day trip from Banff and arrive at the Falls early to mid afternoon and then head back.', 'This is one amazing falls very much so worth the stop lot of different place to see it from and take pictures the noise from the fall is very loud', 'We called in during our tour and were amazed at the size of the areas and angles available to photograph this natural phenomenon.', 'Well woth visiting, but gets seasonally busy with coach loads of visitors making photographs difficult without patience.', 'A great stop on the Icefield Parkway. fantastic falls.Ignore the crowds and walk a little fiurther towards the lake', 'A must-see! We went later in the afternoon when the crowds were minimal. The power of the water is amazing and worth the visit.', 'Athabasca falls are impressive and definitely worth a visit.

Just watching and listening to the rush of water is both exhilarating and peaceful.\", 'a place to stop and rest the legs and have a great picnic.\\nThe pictures and and the views are worth the stop.', 'The Falls and the canyon were beautiful. There are several walkways that give differing views of the falls and the effect of the water on the surrounding rocks. One of the walks is down an old channel of the falls and you can see where the water cut the rocks.', 'I\\'m torn on what to write. I\\'m giving it a \"very good\" rating because I loved it when I was a kid, but it didn\\'t have the same impact on me the second time I went as an adult. It\\'s a good way to kill 30-60 minutes. The views are stunning and you\\'ll have the opportunity to take a lot of nice pictures, but it isn\\'t a situation I love. It feels like a Banff attraction that is in Jasper. It was packed with tourists the two times I went. That kind of takes away from the experience for me. You want to take a moment to soak in the view, but you also don\\'t want to be rude to the people waiting to stand in that prime spot. There are a few areas where it can get pretty congested. I\\'d also recommend bringing a light jacket. You might not need it but there\\'s a fairly constant breeze that can make it a little cold. There are other places around Jasper that I would recommend over the Athabasca Falls, but there is something special about seeing that powerful water flowing.', 'Easily accessible waterfall with high volume. Below, there are whirlpools carved into bedrock before spilling out into a lake about 3 blocks below falls. Well worth the stop needed to see them, as they are so readily accessible.', 'Easy access to impressive falls. Beautiful mountain in the background. Climb down to the bottom through the staircase made out of the rock. Beautiful area. Only con is it is filled with people and many are rude. Lots of tour bus visitors that swarm.', 'Plan at least 30 minutes to walk around and photograph the falls and river.

Can also climb down to the bottom of the falls where the join the river.', \"Great views of the waterfalls and rivers.

Brewster were reliable, picked us up hotel to...More', 'This place is not to be missed! A very beautiful place for picture taking. So close to nature. Just wonderful. Quite a number of tour buses parked when we came so sort of crowded. Its June and lots of water flowing and was just amazing.', 'We were on our way from Banff to Jasper and this was on the way.

The sound is amazing.', \"Like the rest of the Rockies, just gaze in awe. Ferocious falls and beautiful green blue lake.....even on a gloomy day........ We stopped on our way back to Banff - definitely worth a visit as you're passing, or a trip out from Jasper.\", 'An interesting geological feature formed by the power of the Athabasca River carving a ravine through the rock over the last period since the Ice Age. The power and volume is impressive. A short walk guides you to the viewing spits, it can be busy. There are excellent viewing points to the North , outside the main car park. Combine this with a slow drive along 93A towards Jasper, thus old road is great for scenery and wildlife.', \"It was kind of a rainy day but we decided to see the glaciers and Athabasca Falls. Both were easy to get to and stunning. The Falls are so accessible and so beautiful -- now in the first part of July when there is so much water#!

But once I visited, I was convinced why this tops the list of things to do in Jasper. I don't usually get too excited by waterfalls, but this is so beautiful, violent and amazing. The force of water so enormous and it has carved out the rocks. You can see these falls from different views and all views leads to great experience :). I would really go again and feel the beauty of mother nature.\", 'You must visit this place. Pretty awesome ewspecially after a lot of rain .A must for keen photographers.', 'A lot of water flows over these falls. Nice. It had just rained and the walkways were a little slippery.', 'The Falls have cut changing channels over the centuries and you can walk to the river through which the river no longer flows. They are beautiful all year round, and very different in winter.', 'Besides being large and complex, this is falls is uniquely beautiful because of the way the blue-green glacial water has carved through many narrow colorful strata of rock. One of a kind. Probably what I liked least is the distance of the falls from home in Virginia, USA', \"Great spot for rainbows from the mist coming off the raging water. Lots of things to read about along the trails they have set up for safety. You can safely view the falls from many different angles getting lots of photo's. There are trails up above and down below the falls. It's about 25 kms towards the icefeilds from Jasper. The Mountains keep getting more excellent looking as you approach the ice fields.\", 'We live in New Zealand, and we thought we had some beautiful waterfalls, but you have to experience Canada for this.', 'A short drive from Jasper to this amazing place.

The force of the water is quite loud and amazing to see. Worth seeing!', 'I would definitely stop here to check out the falls. They are beautiful and there are also picnic tables where you can stop to have a meal. Great stop! No cost but you do have to pay to get into the park.', 'Although this is a very busy and often crowded place, it is worth at least a quick stop. The falls roar down the canyon, and the start of the falls is pretty with the mountain backdrop. The colors of the layers of rock in the canyon are beautiful.

We stopped on the way from Banff to Jasper after being advised to do so. The falls are in a gorgeous setting with the mountains behind. Not as impressive as some we have seen but still worth the visit.', 'Although not so high, these falls are thunderously powerful so that you can feel the vibration in your body. The walk ways are carefully fenced with plenty of warnings about the danger of straying beyond them along with sad mementos of those who did so and fell to their deaths. We walked the river path and also through the tunnels left from where the river previously pounded through. Fascinating \\xa0to see the sculpture of so many years. Beyond the last fall we watched whitewater rafters launch and whizz down river.\\xa0', 'we stopped here very early friday morning, was so peaceful, no one were there yet.

Visited when it wasn't too crowded so had plenty of places for photos and just to reflect on the rush of water and views.\", 'Beautiful waterfall, quick stop, lots of people. Maybe go early in the morning before it gets busy. Only takes about 1/2 hour to walk around and see the falls and river from different view points.', 'The falls themselves are not overly spectacular but the river running below is breathtaking. Would definitely stop especially since access to the falls is close to the parking lot. Not wheelchair accessible.', 'Amazing waterfall in the majestic Jasper National Park. A must see!! There are walkways and paths around the canyon that is formed by the waterfall (do NOT climb over the fencing, it is dangerous as the rocks are slippery when wet and tourists have lost their lives in search of the \"special photo\").', 'The falls are about 44 miles west of the Icefields Glacier Discover Centre and 20 miles to the east of Jasper.

Very nice stop', 'Well worth a stop to see these falls. While not the most dramatic of waterfalls, they are in a very pretty setting and still impressive.', 'Thoroughly enjoyed this! Stopped here on the way from Jasper to Lake Louise. The Canadian Rocky Mtn. parks department should be commended for the excellent way they have designed the parks so visitors can get the absolute best views in a safe setting. They allow us to get so much closer to the rushing water than we would otherwise be able to do. Kudos to them for the excellent walkways!', 'These fall are easy to get to and handicap accessible.

Just try to get there before the peek hour so you can enjoy them better.

Keep behind the barriers - there is a memorial to someone who didn't!\", \"We stopped here as part of our tour on the way to Jasper so the only regret was that we didn't have more time here and get to do a proper walk, but what we did see it looked a wonderful place.

The road to the Glacier is tight but we saw black bear and grizzly in the morning (after 9.00am so not too early from Jasper)', 'Cloudy day, but the falls were beautiful and easy to walk to with several overlooks.

We walked around the fall a little bit and found it to be really beautiful. It won't take one hour to see the whole area. Nice.\", 'This is a beautiful waterfall with nearby looped hiking that leads through a small canyon with viewpoints of the river. It is a bit tough to walk around especially if there are a lot of people or if you have mobility difficulties, but it is overall paved. The water is incredibly blue here and it is fun to see several different things (falls, river, canyon) in the area rather than just one attraction.', 'We stopped at Athabasca Falls on our drive to Lake Louise AB from Jasper AB. We stopped early in the morning and pretty much had the place to ourselves. Very pretty Falls, the color of the water never stops amazing me!

This fall is very near from the highway. The water level was high during this visit. The surrounding views are beautiful. There is always a crowd here. Plenty of photography viewpoints. On certain occasions rainbows can be seen in the water vapors thrown out by the waterfall.', \"We travelled Alberta starting in Athabasca, then Edmonton, and into the Rockies to Jasper, Lake Louise, Banf, and out to Calgary. The stop at Athabasca Falls was well worth it, beautiful site and nice walking paths. If you're making the trip between Jasper and Lake Louise, make this stop.\", 'We paid a brief visut to this spot on tour but enjoyed its beauty and magnifence. The variety of colour and clarity of the water make a great place to visit.', 'The Falls are between Jasper and the Columbia Icefield -- it was a nice spot to walk around and there are some rafting trips that are there. I would recommend if you have time taking the \"back road\" to Jasper for some awesome glacial lakes and side roads that are lovely and a little quieter. LOTS of people here when we were here (the busiest spot besides the icefield on our trip)', \"We visited while travelling between Lake Louise and Jasper and were very glad that we did, it's just at the side of the road but would have been quite a trip from Jasper. Well worth it anyway, very beautiful place and some nice gentle hikes here.\", 'Jasper national park was very scenic and the Athabasca falls was spectacular. One can visit any number of times and still not get enough!', 'The fall together with the rainbow looked breathtakingly beautiful.\\nOverall it was an amazing experience', 'Do not miss this.

The falls will inspire you with their beauty and overwhelm you with the power of water.\", 'Lovely views, easy walking (just be careful not to slip!) and great photo opportunities.

The scenery up to the falls is breathtaking. The falls are just fabulous. Great photo opportunity. Remember to take your camera and video recorder and water. There are no shops en route.', 'Have seen a few water falls across the world in my time and this is an average spectacle of water and its power. The falls are easily accessible from the car park and have well laid out pathways around the various angles that you can view them. The day we visited it had been raining so the water was high and the falls were in full force - look out for the cut outs that the water has created in the canyon walls', 'Worth spending a little time to see. Spectacular. Accessible. Memorable. See it when it is sunny and bright, or cloudy and snowy as it was when we saw it.', 'Make sure you go to the lower falls area too!

There are some stairs on either side of the falls.\\nA gem!', 'If your driving past, you need to hop out and have a look.

Nice spot to stop for a lunch and take a 2km walk after lunch down to the bottom of the falls', 'An amazing view from every bridge! We did about half the trek. Not for folks in moderately shape. I would suggest paying for guided hike so you can experience all of the falls if you dont walk to walk the whole length if falls back up to your car.', \"Stopped with a tour group and was so happy we did. This is a beautiful waterfall and area. It's convenient and right off the main road and you could see most in 20 minutes if you are in a hurry.\", \"Interesting to see the power of the river as it carved out the rock. Short walk to see and hear the falls shouldn't be missed.\", 'So nice to have this scenic stop within walking distance!! This is a must see when traveling the Icefields Parkway!', 'These were some of the more awe-inspiring waterfalls in this area. Quite majestic! It was neat that stairs were created down the old waterways so you can see up close how the water shaped the rock. I enjoyed feeling the pounding of the water and the refreshing mist (best vantage point on the other side of the bridge to the left).', 'These stunning falls are well worth a visit. Visually beautiful they remind you of the power of nature! Great photo opportunity of a fabulous feature of the Canadian Rockies! You must see them whilst in the area.

As everywhere here, the paths are well cared for, litter free, and all seem rather understated.', 'It is different from the other parts of Banff with special \"land scape\".

Make sure you pack some warm layers..', 'We had poor weather when we visited Athabasca falls but it was spectacular despite the this.

Stop at each one for a different angle of these beautiful falls.\", 'The falls themselves are not massive, but still seem quite spectacular, but it is more the surrounding area that evelates this as a great place to visit.

Easy to spedn a few hours wandering around and taking it all in.', \"The falls are beautiful! There are paved walking trails with written information at points of interest. The falls are just off the icefields parkway. I highly recommend stopping in to view the falls. You won't be disappointed.\", 'The amount and power of the water is very impressive.

Toilet facilities by parking lot and drinking water', 'The sheer power of the water is amazing. It is easy to move around the various view points. To see how the water has eroded the rock over time is really awesome.', 'The falls were awesome. I had no idea how great they would be. There is a short 20 minute loop walk where you can see and HEAR the falls. We did not go on the longer trails but the loop walk was well worth visiting.', 'Well worth stopping off and visiting this area. The surroundings have not been spoiled too much even though it is a very popular tourist attraction. The falls are stunning and show the real power of nature. Signage and information quite good but public toilets are revolting holes in the floor with awful smells!', \"Definitely worth a visit, spectacular. Fantastic waterfalls but make sure you use the loo prior to arriving as the on site ones left you gagging for breath. Don't let that put you off though.\", \"I love the mountains! I love the falls.

No entrance fee.', 'The view is awesome and breathtaking to see Mother Nature at its picturesque the sounds of the waters rushing through the canyon wow', 'You cannot visit Jasper with stopping here.

There is a small trail too and can view falls via canyon.\\nAttached are pics.', 'The falls are beautiful but for me the best part was going down the canyon towards the riverbank, where the beach is covered with hundreds of inukshuks people have made.

Definitely worth the stop!\", \"Don't know why I have never stopped here before? So beautiful... short 2 minute walk to the falls so it is suitable for all ages. There are other hikes that can go much further down the canyon but I did not go.. The area can be slippery so be careful and the falls are powerful so watch the little ones... if you went over the railings I think you would be a goner for sure.\", 'Amazing experience. Visited twice and enjoyed both times. Amusing signs that were also informative. Got some great photos.', 'Make sure this is on your list of things to do in Jasper. Through time, water has carved itself a deep path through rocks and mixed in with that blue blue water, this place is a must see.

Lots of photo spots along the way and easy to access once you park, no hike needed.', \"If you are travelling highway 93 between Jasper and Banff or only staying in Jasper this is a worthwhile stop off. The power of the falls is impressive and it's location is beautifulFrom the parking lot it is a short walk to the falls and some short hikes to get different view points above or below the falls. A fence was built to stop people going out onto the wet, slippery rocks to get a photo or selfie but it seems that every year someone climbs over of goes around the fence, slips on the rocks and is killed. You can take highway 93 to and from the falls but highway 93A between Jasper and the falls is much quieter and gives the chance to visit Mt Edith Cavell.\", 'The falls are easily accessible and are particularly good in the late spring. They can be viewed from many different angles. There is also a hiking trail.', 'Many varied views of the falls and deep chasms. Go early as it gets very crowded. Many of the walkways are paved with bridges across the falls with varied views.', \"I liked this stop on the IceField Parkway as the falls are not a long hike from the parking lot. In fact they are really no hike at all, no special footwear needed. It's easy for handicapped and elderly persons to see a spectacular view. The viewing areas are so well done and allow you to see the falls on one side and beautiful serene mountain lake on the other. Well worth the stop.\", 'Gorgeous views of carved waterfalls. Trails are easy to maneuver. You are rewarded with great pictures but be prepared to encounter a lot of tourists.', 'The Athabasca falls are a 5-8 min drive from most hotels in Jasper. There is a nice walking trail around the falls. The falls', 'Although this waterfall will not qualify as world class in height & width, the sheer power of the Athabasca River narrowing & flowing through this narrow chasm is awesome especially as seen right from the brink.

We could have stayed much longer, just admiring the view.', 'About 20 kilometers out of Jasper on the Icefields Parkway. Relatively easy walk with nice views of the falls from different angles.', 'On the trip to view the Canadian Rockies. Lovely fall but not the best. Niagara Falls is the clear winner.

Some paths are narrow, especially when busy and quite wet in places.', 'Lots of good vantage points. (some rainbows in cascade ). Easy walk; some steps to go down/climb back to go below falls. Beautiful blue water. Rocks and foliage are very good. Pretty good site for photographers. Obey warnings to not go beyond fence. Adequate restrooms. Can get crowded.', \"The Athabasca Falls are truly spectacular. The boardwalk trail which leads to the lower level of the falls is well maintained. There are quite a few stairs here but it's worth the effort. I'm no photographer but the images of the falls on my ipad are just stunning. The day we visited there was a National Parks representative on the walkway between the carpark and the Falls with pelts from local wildlife. We stopped and had a look and spoke at length with this young man who was extremely informative about local wildlife and history. We found the Park Rangers in attendance at many popular spots around Jasper and I must say I think it's a wonderful initiative! As I say, there are quite a few stairs so if you have mobility issues you may just view the Falls from the top. There are a few seats scattered around up there too.\", 'Easy access, safe and good location of the highway. Could us a bit of update and some control of runoff.', 'Several nice views of the Athabasca Falls are available around the site. Lots of parking. Parts of the walkway can be slippery in the rain.', 'The falls are a really short walk from the parking lot. In winter the frozen waterfall is amazing and it even looks good in summer.

Definitely worth a side trip.\", 'Definitely stop and enjoy this spectacular sight of Mother Nature, you will not be disappointed.

Well constructed walkways means that you can get up close to see the force of the falls.A good stop off point half way between Lake Louise and Jasper.', 'The Athabasca falls are pretty incredible. Take the time to learn the history of the falls and it makes them even more appreciated. The gorge which has formed is amazing, the walking paths have made viewing this treasure very accessible for everyone. Great place stop in your travels and spend some time admiring the power of these falls and what they have created. There is nice picnic areas and facilities.', 'Always spectacular! Enjoyable as always only thing there were places hard to get a gòd view to busload of tourists with their self sticks and cameras but I quess that is one of the challenge of a high tourist spot.

Make sure to stop at these magnificent falls. Take time to view it from all the various view points.', 'This is one of the must see places on the Icefield Parkway... worth a visit on a road trip to Jasper.

Very conveniently located right off the Icefields Parkway.', \"You'll need at least 30 to 45 minutes to take in all of the paths to see both the top and the bottom of these magnificent falls. The rock strata made visible by the water cut is worth a close look. It's a 'must do' in Jasper National Park.\", 'Stunning. PMake a great picture post card. The falls were in full flight with the melting snow. The roaring of the water over the falls could be heard for miles. The falls. Drop off in a number of places along the canyon until it drops down into a wider part of the river. Well worth hiking along the trails beside the falls.', \"I try to review places with an eye for those less-abled, I feel there's not enough info sometimes. You can see a lot of the upper falls via accessible trails, but for the lower falls and the lake, you need to be fairly fit. This is a place worth stopping!! Plenty of washrooms, parking may be an issue during high season (May & Sept are shoulder season). I suggest to do the stairs/light short hike to the beach, if you're able, the views are breathtaking\", \"Athabasca Falls is located within Jasper National Park on the upper Athabasca River just south of Jasper on the Icefield Highway. Allow at least one hour here as the scenery is gorgeous & there are plenty of opportunities to take some inspiring landscape photo's. The Athabasca Falls is a waterfall where the Athabasca River funnels into a wild running gorge just metres from the car park. There is a timber boardwalk which meanders along the gorge & a path which goes deeper into the canyon. There is ample parking available & toilet's. A great place to spot to stretch the legs if driving along the Icefield Highway.\", 'On the road between Jasper and Lake Louise and every tour operator will stop here and for a very good reason. Everyone likes a good waterfall.', 'What a magnificent view of nature at its most powerful, tonnes of water cascading over the rocks , the noise water spray all combine to give you a wow feeling', 'The falls were spectacular. It is worth spending around 30 mins here. Many scenic pictures to be taken here. Be careful not to cross the barriers/edges though.', \"Super view of the falls and you can walk down to the canyon bottom, which isn't all that far. Mostly paved so suitable for all. Drop toilets in the car park, bit smelly but ok.

If you are an outdoors type person it is worth the small walk.', 'The falls are only a short distance walk from the car and bus parking area and are well worth taking the 20 minutes to walk there and back and see how all the melt water from the Athabasca River falls into a very steep but short chasm.', 'Lovely clean place to visit. Beautifull views of the falls. An easy walk with steps to the falls. Beautifull example of washing machine whirling pool.', 'The sound from these falls are fearsome and at least 2 young men have died by not keeping to the designated path.', 'Athabasca is a stunning display of the power of water as it rushes through narrow channels.

It could get real crowded in the high season.', 'Well worth the stop as the falls were nice. It was a short walk to the falls and we walked down to the area below the falls which was worth doing. All in all it was a nice place to get out and stretch.', \"It's not just the Falls but the deep and incredibly narrow canyon below the falls. The river had cut a canyon but unusually the hard rock won out and eventually it overflowed, redirected and cut the deep canyon which can be seen today. This is presumably because of the spring floods with glacial melt water (millions of years ago?). A rare example of rock beats water. You can walk the old canyon too. Another amazing fact is the fish above and below the falls which is way too high to be passed. Presumable early First Nations introduced some trout above the falls for ease of fishing and to spread the valuable food source. An example of early farming?\", \"Very beautiful place, lots of hiking trails, breathtaking panorama's, fun and educative place to show natural aspects to children\", 'The water falls are incredible.

Easy walking to all levels although there are some steps to the lower level.', 'The walk to and bridges across the falls offer a great view (and photo op) of the river, falls and canyon. Highly worthwhile stop if traveling in this area as the walk to the falls is less than 5 min from the car park.

Would love to bring the kids back.', \"We visited the falls on a rainy, cloudy, day, but it didn't detract from the experience. The falls are not particularly high or wide, but are still beautiful.

We were there around noon. The guy we bought sandwiches from promised us there wouldn't be lots of people there, but there like 12 tour buses of high school kids there. The parking lot was nice. The water fell off of the rocks. It was a little loud. Lots of smokers, which made the smell of the falls a lot less enjoyable.Not wheelchair accessible.\", 'We almost passed by this assuming it was just another water fall. However, the way it has cut into the rock makes it interesting and a special stop.', \"If you going to Jasper, make sure you visit this place. It's a little less than an hour drive from downtown. If you see wildlife along the way, it's a bonus.When you get to the parking area, there were multiple Washrooms and picnic tables.A little walk to the falls, lot's stairs and rails. Be careful on some tight spots of the area.Wonderful views from different locations.

Beautiful experience', 'Just happened upon these falls. They are probably one of he nicest falls I have ever seen. Well kept area. Many viewing areas. Spectacular with mountains in the background.', 'First time in Alberta and had to go and see these falls it was a bit of a hike as we were staying in Radium Hot Springs BC (5 hours away). We decided to do an overnight to Jasper National Park and were really excited to get to see these Falls. The color of the water is so unique (blue/green) and really clear. There are plenty of signs explaining the history and geographically content of the Falls. No very crowded when we were there as there was still ice and snow on some of the trails (many were closed still from winter). Plan to spend at least an hour with lots of picture taking opportunities.', 'The first time I traveled to Jasper park was in the summer, the water was raging and the falls were breathtaking .. and I am from Alaska, so it takes a lot to impress me! .. I have been there in Fall and also early spring. During the early spring trip the water was frozen, therefore leaving Malign Canyon dry! ..

Also, spring time is less crowded as i only ran into one other person on the entire hike!', 'When you are surrounded by spectacular nature, what is another gem? Great 15 minute trip out from the Jasper townsite, you pass stunning vistas to get to Athabasca falls. It is amazing to see how water has carved rock over the years.

It was a nice 15 minute or so drive from jasper down highway 93A very impressive drive.

The falls can be spectacular in the spring. A must see!!', \"I suspect the seasons can make for different experiences here but this is a simples stop for a bathroom break and a stretch with a view. It's 90 seconds to walk to the falls form the lot. The falls are basic and not great viewing despite considerable view points being built out. It's just the nature of the falls, they are hard to get a great view. It could be that the walk down the canyon is ok, but it was closed. The cramped space and all the people and the lack of exciting falls and lack of great views made this a total bust for me. I can barely recommend it except for maybe people, with kids. Young kids.\", 'Have been to many falls - bigger and much more vicious. Something about this one just blew me away. Got there just before the snow had melted completely so was not in full force yet the water was quite powerful and very green. A must visit. Not very busy when we went there so we had most of the falls to ourselves. What a treat.', 'Wonderful place to visit. A little tricky in the spring as part of the path down to the lake was closed due to ice.', 'I have been to many waterfalls and athabasca falls to me is average and mediocre. The falls themselfs are only around 60 feet high and partially obstructed by the rock canyon, there always seems to be lots of people at these falls so there is a lot of bumping shoulders. The nature walk down to the river is nice.', 'This is well worth the trip to make the visit. Lots of different views of the falls and many panel boards discussing various factual tidbits on how they were formed.', 'Decided this would be a great stop to have a snack and stretch our legs. Traveling with a teen, pre teen, and a five year old. This area was easily accessible. It was gorgeous, between the frozen parts of the falls and blue colors of the water it made for great pictures.', 'We had a look here one day. Beautiful.

We were the only people there. We've been there in the summer, which is impressive, but the winter is beautiful. The falls are frozen except a small amount of water under the ice. It's beautiful.\", 'The falls are a great attraction to visit while in the Jasper area.

The sprays from the waterfall will form rainbows on a sunny day. It is a easy walk around with lots of beauty to admire.', 'Absolutely loved our hike here! Bring your camera and take your time. So much beauty to enjoy. We went without a map, and tried looking online for it part way through, to find spotty service haha.

Clean area as well so its a great place to spend time.', 'The Athabasca Falls are not very large, nor have a great height, but are very picturesque and the white foaming waters and the deep, narrow canyon after the falls offer great photo opportunities.

The colour of the water is incredible with interesting rock formations that the water streams through.', 'Went once in the fall & now in the winter, alittle icey walk in but the falls are beautiful to see with all the ice & crystal blue water. Lower trails all closed off for safety', \"Stopped off at the Athabasca falls on my tour through Jasper. Visited here a few times and keep on visiting every time I do.

The stairs to the lower falls was roped off with a DO NOT ENTER sign. A beautiful sight and well worth visitng\", 'Came across this along ice field parkway .

The falls are wildly beautiful and is a must see.', 'stunning sight..totally loved it.we took loads of pictures.there were restrooms close by.a must visit.', 'The difference in water flow between spring, fall and winter is amazing. The water never stops because of the weight and friction of an ice sheet glacier at the Columbia Ice fields. No admittance charges as long as you have the standard National Park Pass. Do not stop if you see four or more tour busses as the view points are quite small and no Parks Personnel to assist with crowd control or information. It is a thing you enjoy more with the quiet and serenity of the moment. No facilities.', \"We drove out New Year's Day to take the short hike and view the falls in the winter.

Educational and picture worthy.\", 'These falls along with Sunwapta are both worthy of your time whilst touring the Icefield parkway road.

Accessible to all and a short walk from the parking lot.\\nPlease make sure to stay within the allowed walkways. Accidents can happen if not\", 'The drive in was nice and clean. The falls was beginning to freeze but still falling. The only downside is where the walk goes down to the river on the left, seems to be used as a public bathroom. Still one of natures most beautiful sights.', 'One of the many must see attractions in the area .It can get quite busy when 2 or 3 tourist buses turn up together .Be careful when it rains as it can get slippy underfoot.The etched canyon walls are quite impressive as is the startling blue of the water as it rushes through. Very photogenic so take your camera', \"Me and my family (wife and 1 year old) stopped here back in mid August (took awhile to get to my review lol) but this place is definitely worth a stop.. It doesn't take long to see, but there is quite a few flights of stairs which made a bit of a hassle for our stroller and can get pretty busy, best to go in the morning or evening.. But other than that it was well worth it, the roar of the falls sure is something to hear..

Different site every season.', \"This is a beautiful waterfall on the Athabasca River; Breathtakingly beautiful. We're from the south U.S and just don't have this kind of water.

One of the best waterfalls we stopped at during our drive on the Columbia Parkway. This one is worth the stop and the walk.', 'Great photo opportunity. Lovely waterfall, fast moving water.

Just take a look!', \"We were on a tour, and this was one of the stops along the way from Banff to Jasper.Athabasca Falls a very powerful waterfall, due to the large quantity of water falling into the gorge. What was most interesting was that the force was so strong that it basically produced a diamond-like drill on the rocks. We were a bit surprised that it was still this strong, even though it's mid-September (we've had drought for 10 years in Los Angeles area, and even some falls are fairly dry by this time of the year).Photos, hopefully in order, show the gradual increase of water and the buildup.\", 'This is a spectacular stop, not to be missed.

Loved it!', 'Monolithic rock formations have obviously been carved by eons of water cascading over them, eddies swirling glacial minerals against them like sculptors’ tools. Spectacular views from a bridge crossing the river made me long for the opportunity to hike the trail that lead to the bottom, where kayakers gather to shoot the rapids.

Lots of free parking and paved trails leading to several lookout points.', \"Great day - seen some very picturesque countryside and did not have to do the driving, parking the car etc. I used both Banff and Jasper as my places of stay for a week while exploring all the surrounding country and sights. There is a much larger choice of good accommodation and places to eat in Banff than in Jasper as it is a much larger town.The day trip included Johnson's Canyon, Lakes Liouse and Moraine (very beautiful), and then up to the railway spiral tunnels and on to the Athabasca Falls. The best lake trip to do from Jasper is to Lake Maligne via the Maligne Canyon. This includes a cruise to the other end of the lake where you can get off and take great photos of the famous scenery encompassing Spirit Island, the lake, and the surrounding mountains. You see it in nearly every scene calendar of the Canadian Rockies. But you have to see it for yourself to take in the real beauty of that part of our planet.For the person who doesn't mind a bit of exercise, take the Jasper Tramway to the top of Whistler Mountain and then hike to the top. You will need good boots and a warm jacket as there is always a bit of snow up there. The views from the top are most rewarding.\", \"My wife and I were in Jasper National Park in August of 2015 and we were fortunate to see Athabaska Falls before the smoke came into the park from Eastern Washington. We thoroughly enjoyed the view and the trail to the falls. The entire Icefield's Parkway was beautiful and this was a nice place to stop and get out and take a nice walk to the Falls.

Spectacular falls with breattaking Rockies backdrop.Dull when we called in the morning but sunlit in the evening on our return which showed it and its backdrop in all their glory.', 'Driving to Lake Louise from Jasper, a stop at Athabasca Falls is well worth it. Only draw back was the large number of large tour buses. The falls are amazing and beautiful, when all of the \"selfie\" takers finish and leave. It is recommended that paths and trails are adhered to. Not a place for solace.', 'When you step out of the car, you can tell why this is a popular tourist stop along the Icefields Highway. You can hear the thunder of the falls, but also take in the very tangible surroundings - the trees, the plant life, even the birds and other animals that make the area their home. I visited in late September 2015 and lucked out by having beautiful sunny weather. Still, there was ice on the bridge overlooking the falls, so be careful and be aware. But for picture takers, this place will not disappoint. When you look up, you will be inspired by the mountains in the backdrop. The water was a turquoise and obviously quite cold. The bathrooms were \"national park\" style and could have been much cleaner, but that is a comment on some of the people who use them - makes one wonder. A worthwhile stop along your route and it\\'s not too far from Jasper.', 'Wow, incredible power. We rafted the Athabasca earlier and then went and saw the falls which really makes you appreciate this river and the fact that we got off it when we did with the guide.', 'Very powerful waterfall and a great spot to stop when driving from Banff to Jasper, or the other way around.

If you like to take pictures this is one of the best landmarks you can find.', 'These falls are well worth stopping to see and are just a short walk from the parking lot. Another popular spot along the Icefields Parkway so can get quite busy. There is a nice pathway that is a easy hike and gives you a number of different views of the both the falls and the mountains behind them. Although they are not the highest falls, there is a vast amount of water shooting through the gorge which is very impressive.

Parks Canada has excellent interpretive signage and paths. Short walk from the parking area on paved paths.', 'Wonderful groomed trails,I always go back, the views are spectacular! many choices of trails to take I love the rock stairs between the wall of rocks', 'stunning scenery the falls are fabulous and not too long a walk off the road to see them. No place to have a drink or toilet on site', 'Beautiful site with a nice cozy restaurant in the vicinity on the highway. The Falls are so unique and beautiful. Worth a visit, lots of parking and nice walk in the area.', 'We stopped here because we were staying in a nearby campsite. At first glance, I thought it might just be a boring little touristy stop. But there are actually several different pathways to explore. My 4 year son loved it. Make sure you stay on the path, and take warnings seriously. One slip into the river, and you will not come back!! We would come here again forsure, our next trip to jasper.', 'The falls made a good stop on the Icefields Parkway; it is just about the northernmost point of interest on the parkway and is close to Jasper townsite.

The Falls were fabulous and we stayed a while just staring at the moving water.', 'Went here on a rainy day but the place was packed. There were school groups and bus loads of people. The falls were very interesting and worth the trip. Of note, was the way the falls cascaded through the cliffs, making a very interesting site.

The parking lot is right along the parkway and a very short walk will take you to the falls. The power of the falls is so unexpectedly strong. Follow the easy trail along the canyon, and it’s hard to believe how calm Athabasca River is while it was just thundering through a very short distance up the canyon. It is well worth a stop.', 'We did a white water rafting trip with Jasper Rafting down the Athabasca River and loved the scenery. Very cold day but wet suits keep you warmish.\\nOur guide was very informative and fun.', 'this was a fabulous part of our trip to Jasper- beautiful waterfall and lovely canyon pathways.

Boy were we wrong. Wound up spending 2 hours admiring the power and awesomeness of nature, particularly the velocity of water. Well worth the trip!!\", \"This is a must-see if you're visiting Jasper National Park. At certain times of the year (early spring and summer) the falls are at their peak and very inspiring to see.

It was cold so wear lots of layers. Wonderful place for plenty of Kodak moments.', \"Athabasca Falls is beautiful. Even considering the crowd of people, I'd advise anyone to stop during their exploration of the Icefields Parkway. Don't just stop at the first viewpoint; take time to walk the area and appreciate all of the viewpoints. Because of the large number of tourists, we did not linger -- only spent about 30 minutes.\", \"I've been here numerous times over the years and throughout the different seasons, things have changed over the years and it's more fenced in for safety these days. Yes, there are fools that climb over the railing and put no only themselves in danger but those who would have to rescue them. The view of the falls is beautiful and one could easily spend hours just sitting there taking in the view and sound of the falls. However, the spot gets very crowded at times and some folks aren't polite and basically push their way in front of you to get a photo. Really not necessary as some of us (myself) would be willing to take the group photo for them if only good manners would shown.It's certainly a spot I'll return...just hoping the next time it will be less busy.

May need to fight for photo spots. Many viewing points. Do the walk down the old river route (there are a few steps) which takes you to different views of the canyon and the river - crowds thin out here and you can sit on rocks by the water. Unfortunately steps mean difficult for wheelchair access to most of the site.', \"It's a beautiful, natural attraction - which is still free of charge! I highly recommend stopping and taking time to explore the falls and the canyon while you are passing through the area.\", 'I have visited the Athabasca Falls three times during the last 4 years and in three different seasons. It has been accessible in April and October – for sure in July as well. And it has been worth seeing it in all seasons.In April it was frozen, in October it had the most amount of water and it was for sure and by far the most crowded in July. Incredible! Be sure to go there early in the morning when you want to take some pictures without a bunch of idiotic tourists who climb over fences to get the most amazing picture using the longest selfie-stick you have ever seen. If you go there to be entertained, go there around noon during peak season. I promise you, you will be amazed how stupid the majority of the Brewster bus tourists are… I can still barely believe what I saw.Other than that: One of the iconic spots in the Canadian Rockie´s Nationalparks and a must see.', 'Absolutely will go back there- so amazing and so beautiful !!\\nShort walk from the parking lot and different levels to view from.

(Great to grab a few photos for your instagram followers)The waterfall is something you can just stand there and take in for some time - the sound and overall power of the falls is captivating. Not far down on a trail is the lower area where the water eventually comes down to a clearing. Here you can grab some more pretty pictures & pose with the crystal clear waters.Free, beautiful, natural; what more could you want?\", \"Beautiful waterfalls and canyon. Get there early so you don't have to deal with all the tour buses and tourists.

Well worth a visit', \"The crowds couldn't ruin the beauty of this place, though by the state of the public toilets you're almost convinced that they're actually trying to...GROSS but not the Falls fault, so not incorporating that experience into my review. Allow some time to walk to the bottom of the canyon to where the river widens out and avoid the first view point at the top especially during visits during peak periods of summer and long weekends, unless you're nostalgic for a mosh pit full of tourists. all trying to take the same picture (now I miss the Mona Lisa)...\", \"A must stop!!!

Great viewing spots, easily accessible for all the family.

It was an enjoyable place to stop for half an hour.', 'Lovely falls we visited on the drive to jasper. Free parking once you get into the park. The falls are just a little walk from the car park. Well worth a stop off.', \"At the time of our visit, this was rated No 1 in the area on Trip Advisor. It's a decent sized waterfall, but nothing special. Worth a 30 minute stop, and it's free. If you're travelling south on the Icelands Parkway, the falls at Tangle Creek are less powerful but arguably more beautiful.\", 'This is an easy stop off of the Icefield Parkway and a great place for photos. The falls are gorgeous with the mountains in the background. The potholes were fascinating also.', 'Go early before the crowds come especially the coaches. The atmosphere is better and you can take pictures.', 'I love waterfalls and this was one of the most powerful waterfalls I have ever seen.

Beautiful falls and very nicely set up with lookout points on either side of the river.

The power of the water amazing\\nJust about 10 mins from jasper, good parking, toilet facilities.', \"Spectacular falls a short drive from Jasper.

It does not take long, the crowds are not onerous and it is a wonderful way to get out and stretch your road legs.Listen and read the signs about staying within the rail boundaries. It was disheartening to read the stories of the 2-young men memorialized on benches after losing their lives trying to get an up-close look at the Falls.

There is not a lot of room in some of the viewing areas.\", 'This waterfall is amazing, so even if the parking lot is jammed, stop, wait for a space, and see this area.

This site is very easily accessible and does not require a long hike. You can fit this attraction in your day very easily.', \"This is a nice stop on the way to or from Jasper. For a short height, the water has a strong current, so it is nice to see this and feel the mist. It doesn't take a lot of time to visit, but you could have a picnic lunch there, too and stay awhile.

Make sure to see from all vantage points.\", \"I've been here twice in 11 years and both times found the amount of people caused it to be quite crowded as it is a most popular attraction. We spent less than 20 minutes and were able to capture some photos and be in our way to more natural settings that are less crowded.\", \"A very nice waterfall that is close to the highway and is thus very accessible.

If you're in the area, it's definitely worth checking out.\", \"Take your camera and spend some time taking pictures of the falls, work with the settings to experiment and capture all the unique views of the water.

Great place!\", 'we have visited these falls in the winter and it was pretty awesome! just saw them this summer and was even more impressed. give yourself at least 30-60 min to explore all the different views. easy walking on this one only 5 min from parking lot. expect a lot of tourists!', \"So beautiful and breathe taking.\\nI really enjoyed hiking all around there and Pandy's enjoyment of it was wonderful.\\nI loved taking so many pictures and going there you will not be disappointed.\\nI go there many times and I always see something new.\", 'Very beautiful I love this place.

Athabasca Falls are not the tallest you'll see, or the fastest, but they are still really pretty and only a short drive from Jasper. Well worth a visit and not too crowded either, at least not when we were there!\", 'Beautiful thundering waterfall and quite accessible for travellers. Close to the highway and an absolute must see if you get anywhere near Jasper. The etching of stone from the falls and river is a remarkable view and appreciated by all ages.', 'Roaring falls in a stunning setting. Saw the glaciers off in the distance.

Too many pushy tourists and happy camera snappers though. A nice stop just outside of Jasper.', \"Athabasca Falls is a must see, The Falls are very powerful and very beautiful. Nature is a powerful force in action and these falls prove it. It's only a short and easy walk to the falls so no excuses if you are in the area! Be aware that there will likely be lots of people viewing at the same time. It's worth the additional small walk to the bottom of the falls to see the view across the valley. Enjoy!\", 'Awesome to witness and hear the force of nature. Makes me wish I had studied physical geography at school.', \"Pretty but, seriously, just a waterfall. If you're from the pacific northwest or surrounding areas, you've seen better. Take the time to see Maligne Canyon... it was a lot more impressive and interesting.\", 'These falls were some of the best we saw on our trip - and we saw a few! Amazing to see how the force of the water has eroded and channeled the rock over the years. Truly awe inspiring to watch the power of the water.', 'What a beautiful look out. Well worth the stop.

You can walk all the way down to the river as well. The kids loved it.', 'Impressive bit of nature! It has a lot of people around but only because it is something you must see. It does require some walking if you want to take it all in.', \"This is a great sight seeing activity if you're not up for a long walk. You don't have to go very far to see everything.

Definitely recommend, plus its free!!\", 'We stopped by while driving to Jasper and must say that they are nice and it is just a 10 minutes walk to see them.', 'The falls were very crowded in the summer, but it is worth a stop to take in the falls. If the crowds get to you, take a quick hike into the woods and you will be fine', 'Based on the reviews, we picked this hike for our trip. Parked at fifth bridge and walked up to the upper parking lot and back. Along the way we were astounded by the beauty of waterfalls, canyon, water, rocks, and bridges. The hike has lots of up and down on uneven surfaces, so not recommended for those who have trouble walking. There is an easier and shorter loop from the upper parking lot though for those who need it. If you can though I highly recommend the longer loop. We returned via the horse trail which added aDifferent view.', 'Pretty spot and worth a look. The falls are impressive and the canyon which has resulted from the power of the falls in very beautiful.', \"Beautiful scenery. Wear good shoes so that you can go for a hike while you're there and not worry about slipping on wet rocks. Bring a camera! No cost other than entry fee into National Park.\", 'Stopped at the Athabasca Falls location for a lunch break. Very impressive falls and the power was impressive. Nice place to take a break, but the picnic tables were a long distance back from the falls area. Would be nice to move a table or two closer to the area to enjoy the view and natural sounds of the area.Viewing areas were varied and made for a nice walk and exploration.', \"Easily accessed and good for a short visit. Steps are involved but there are handrails. It's worth walking the ten minutes to the furthest viewing point for the waterfall and if light is right you will see a rainbow\", \"When we were planning the Western leg of our family's Trans Canada Road Odyssey, one of the MUST SEES we had listed out was Athabasca Falls.And while returning from Jasper via Mt. Edith Cavell to Calgary, we stopped for quite some o admire this marvel of nature. Not only are the falls highly impressive but the surrounding rock formations in a variety of shapes and colours are just astonishing. We walked around the area, crossing a number of bridges to take in the sightsThe roaring water cascading over the rock and disappearing into a gorge and reappearing a little distance away was a magnificent sight and we took our time to savour its beauties.Earlier, we had descended from Mt. Edith Cavell, which is also something to put you in awe of nature. I climbed to the edge of the glacier to appreciate the floating icebergs in the lake at the foot of the mountain and the glacier which looked like a moose head, was unique. The greenish lake fed by the glacier was also an awe inspiring sight and after quite some attempts, we found a spot from where we could get Mt. Edith Cavell reflected in its still water, really a mind boggling sight!!!En route, we also took a detour to see Moab lake where we found the surrounding conifer forest lining the mountainside had been blackened during a forest fire some years ago. The lake itself was a hidden gem, its still blue- green water perfectly reflecting the hillsides around.This detour was indeed one of the most rewarding during our Rockies trip\", 'Easy to get to, but also many people, even from early morning. Great stop, and many Angela to take pictures from. Must see.', 'Beautiful and exciting hike, when we went it was raining, so we have to be really careful walking. I believe it will be even nicer when the weather is promising.', \"Definitely worth the stop! Lots of picture opportunities. Great parking even for large vehicles. Lots of people visiting but didn't feel too crowded.\", \"Very easy stop and we'll worth it (even if it were tough to get to, it would be worth it). Great stop with my parents, which cannot handle tougher hikes. One of the best stops in the park.\", 'Not a large fall, but you can get really up close. Good viewpoints - both of the Fall and the canyon; can also walk down to the river level. A nice getaway if you have 1-2 hours.', \"Sure, it's pretty to see these falls. It is also a quick stop when heading down the road. Give yourself about 20 minutes to see all of this. A plus is that it is cooler here than inland=refreshing!\", 'Not too far from your car if you are not a big time hiker. The watr is amazing and the view is like a painting. In the winter the snow on the trees looks like a postcard and the bridges cross over the steep canyons below.', 'These Falls were amazing. The sound and sight of the rushing water was amazing, and there was something new to see round every corner.', 'I visited the Athabasca Falls in the early evening (say, around 6 PM?) and it was perfect. A lot of people were leaving the falls, probably to have dinner. The falls themselves are very powerful and mesmerizing to watch. I recommend visiting the falls 100%!', \"These falls are some of the most beautiful views I've ever seen, with a (very) minimal amount of hiking. An absolute must see.\", 'Clean area fantastic viewing. The falls never let you down. Especially go to the far side where you all most stand over them', 'This was one of the places that we had planed to visit. It is a beautiful and wild place to visit. It was very busy as there were buses stopping as well. Well worth the time for sure. There are lots of information plaques to look at.', 'Well worth your time to stop and enjoy this waterfall. The falls are only a very short walk from the parking lot, so this works if you have people in your party who can only walk short distances. There are viewpoints on both sides of the lake above the falls, on both sides at the falls, a bridge over the falls, and a viewpoint below the falls. All of them are enjoyable and give you opportunities for great photos.Athabasca Falls is just off Highway 93 (Icefields Parkway) on Highway 93A. There is lots of parking, but it can also be very busy midday. Coming in the morning or late afternoon will help you in the parking lot and with the crowds at the viewpoints.', \"Not much to say here other than the fact that I appreciate that there were no large tour busses and loud people rushing around. In fact, although the area did see quite a bit of traffic, it didn't affect my experience. I found that the falls were very easy to get to...just a few minutes' walk from the parking lot AND you can take a staircase down to the river. It was fantastic to do a quick in-and-out !\", 'IF you are on a driving tour-- good for you! You just picked one of the best sites to visit. If you are on a bus tour you may regret not having enough time to see the Falls the deep pot-holes and water-carved rock formations. If you love rock \"out croppings\" this is the place for you. If you love the sound of rushing water, ditto also. I also highly recommend downloading the Gypsy app for your iPhone or android phone which for only a few bucks gives you the full history of the area.If going in the summer keep a small bottle of Avon SSS (Skin So Soft) handy to chase away the mosquitoes.', \"The Athabasca Falls are a great place to stop and stretch your legs when travelling Hwy 93. The falls are located about 32 Km (give or take) south of Jasper. The walking trails are pretty good but make sure to keep everyone on the trails and eye on the kids (of all ages). Way to many people get carried away and end up in the soup. You will more then likely not survive the 23 meter fall.There is also a chance for wild life so be prepared accordingly.Good idea to bring a sweater or wind breaker, it cools off a fair amount in the shady parts of the trail. Bottle of water is in order.Parking is good, even for RV's. Washrooms available.\", 'These are well worth a visit and are quite spectacular with various different view points so you are best to spend the time moving from one to another to get different views of the falls and to led the crowds move on. Recommended and its free.', \"Amazing! Always a must do on every trip to Jasper. So beautiful, don't miss it! Can get very busy during the day.\", \"We enjoyed our trip to these falls. The water comes from an attractive lake and is forced over the falls with a good deal of momentum. There's a reasonable amount of noise and a good deal of spray and some damp paths that can be a bit slippery. You can view the falls from a number of locations but, like many places, it can get crowded.\", 'This is an excellent point of interest along the Icefields Parkway. They have done an excellent job of giving multiple viewpoints for the falls and canyon. Well worth the stop. We spent about 45-60 minutes here.', 'An easy pull off from the highway. Ample parking. Stunning view of the falls. Drawback...the usual long drop toilet.', \"Really lovely place to visit - the falls are quite impressive with lots of spray and you can cross over and see them from both sides, which is nice. We didn't walk further down the creek as we were on a tour and only had a short amount of time.\", \"This is a very popular location so you would be wise to arrive early or very late. I'm talking theme park crowds. The falls area is truly spectacular with multiple viewpoints to view different parts of the falls from every possible angle. Some of the viewpoints are wheelchair accessible but others require negotiating many and sometimes narrow steps. The main viewpoints are fenced to minimize accidental falls into the frothing water. Entering the water anywhere close to the main falls would likely be catastrophic.\", 'So worth seeing, How can you go wrong when you can be surrounded by such beauty and majestic scenery!', \"To find these falls, you drive south of Jasper and then take a narrow road for about 30 km. It isn't the best road, but the falls are truly amazing. The parking lot is huge. There are outhouses in the parking lot. The falls are a short walk from the parking lot. The sound of the rushing water is amazing. The falls themselves are something else. You can see them from several vantage points. There are 'potholes' that are holes that have been carved away by the constant whirling of the water. The layers of rock that have been carved away by the water is incredible. There are some stairs, but very few. The walk to see all vantage points could be done by most.\", 'Very easy to get to because it was right off the road. Very short hike and very impressive falls. It was worth seeing because it was so accessible.', 'We loved this place. Even though it was busy it is possible to find your own space to appreciate the different views.There is no admission charge & you can easily spend an hour there. I would recommend going downstream as well as the upper levels. Here you can sit & watch in peace. Excellent', 'Beautiful place to stop along the Icefield Parkway near Jasper National Park,easy trail to the falls. There are a few trails to choose depending on how long you want to hike.', 'Worth the trip. Gets very busy so try and arrive early to get a parking space. Combine with icefileds trip.', \"What a beautiful site to behold, the falls offer so much beauty at any time of the year, I recommend seeing it during all the changes in the season, walking the path around the falls to see what Mother Nature has created over thousands of years is a must, it's free, it's peaceful and you really will be in aw.\", 'More spectacular than many of the other falls/lakes alongside the Ice Field Parkway.\\nEasily accessible and just beautiful on a sunny day!', 'Beautiful falls. Easy access to them. They end in the thundering Maligne canyon which is a short distance away', 'The glacier is melting away. The giant truck that carry the tourist on to the ice are great and being on the glacier is amazing.', \"We all thoroughly enjoyed it (ages 11 to 61). The natural beauty and power on display was impressive and mesmerizing. Walkways are easy to navigate and the display boards helped us appreciate nature's power. Don't miss the stairs down to the bottom which follow the ancient water path...phenomenal. We spent about 90 minutes, but it won't take that long if you aren't camera-happy like us.Plus, it's all free. Easily the best of our day trip up the Icefields Parkway from Jasper.Tip: for best photos, go early in the day...lighting at this time provided excellent photographs.\", 'As others have stated, easy to find, easy hike, good up close to falls and the canyon. Can be crowded.', 'Allow at least 45 minutes to explore up and down on both sides. Good little hiking opportunity with lots of scenic beauty.', 'Athabasca falls are gorgeous and the thing that stands out for me is the roaring sound they make. The viewpoints are well placed and it is easy to take great photos!', 'Just beautiful and well worth a visit. The hiking trail to the falls is short and fairly level. It is fabulous to visit at anytime of the year. Covered in ice or roaring in summer, the falls are just gorgeous.', \"Really pretty. It's on the way to Jasper, easy to access and not to be missed. Easy hike, gorgeous pIctures.\", 'A powerful, and picturesque place just of the main highway. A series of waterfalls in a short slot canyon. Great photo ops. Be sure to take the trail down to the bottom.', \"An interesting stop along the highway, the falls aren't anything spectacular but they're definitely worth visiting!\", 'Not a big set of falls, but lots of places to get great views. You get up close and personal with not only the falls, but the canyon and geological changes due to the river/falls. In the winter the falls freeze which is awesome to see!', 'Beautiful spot to enjoy a morning coffee! Be sure to bring one to enjoy this impeccable view. Also carrying a camera is a must for this sight!!', 'Not to far from the highway (so still noisy and not as peaceful as other spots in Jasper) and yet one of the best things to see in Jasper. Great hike and a great place for good pictures.', 'Short stop but nothing exciting. Falls are not that tall compare to what you would expect in the rockies.', \"I love these Falls! I had been here at least 10 times, and I enjoy it every time! Eventhough it's just a 22 meter hige, yet the fact that you can see it frome all angles and get very close to the falling water, makes it so special. Allow at least one hour at the falls.\", 'Located 30 km south (towards Banff) this is well worth a visit.The falls are well signposted like all the other sights along the icefield parkway so you wont miss it.Parking area is just a minutes walk from the falls so no long hike to get there.There are multiple viewing points and a bridge that crosses the gorge.The river cascades down a narrow gorge and there are potholes that have formed from the rocks grinding into the river bed.There is also a short but steep (with steps) walk down to the lake . Its only a 3-4 minute walk and worth doing. There is a vantage point just below the falls which gives a great view of the lake.', 'Visited here on a Brewsters Jasper to Banff Glacier trip. Beautiful day with clear skies. Make sure you walk from the car park all the way round the other side to the falls, absolutely beautiful with the rainbow appearance.', 'Two minutes from the highway. This falls is a must!! Breathtaking views. Plenty of parking spaces. Well signposted.', \"This is a stunning place the visit. The noise and the views are spectacular. It doesn't cost you anything for such an amazing experience. Worth a look for sure.\", 'Minimal Hiking necessary and close from the Highway. A must on the way to Jasper. Refreshing.... takes less than 60 min', \"Not the biggest waterfall I've ever seen, but certainly one of the most magical. I would not have been surprised to see fairies or gnomes walking on the green moss beside this waterfall. Extremely scenic; I found it enchanting!\", 'Walk all around the paths. Every view is worth. The rock formations are beautiful as well as the clear water falling. The place is clean and well preserved. A must when you are near Jasper.', 'One of the easiest waterfalls to get to and one of the most spectacular. A must see. It was a hot day when we were there so it was easy to cool down in the spray plume on the far side of the falls.', \"Very busy but understandably since it's such an awesome sight. Parking slightly difficult at busy times if you arrive in an RV.\", 'Easy walk, well worth it, can get busy late in the day, so try and be there early. Parking can also be problematic over weekends and Public Holidays', 'We stopped off here on our way to Lake Louise. When we pulled into the car park there was a black bear having breakfast. What an amazing surprise. We watched it with several other people before it wandered through the Woods, walked casually down the pavement and then disappeared into the woodland.Oh, and the falls were good too!', 'its a beautiful find in nature, but there are a lot of tourists. there is a small hike to the bottom of the falls, you can even put your feet in the water.', 'A short distance from the Icefield Parkway, usually plenty of parking, and a tremendous view of what must be the greatest volume of water going over a waterfall in Western Canada.A second visit, slightly less water than in 2013, but then again, that was the year of the flooding in South Alberta. Still as spectacular, though', 'These falls are right off the freeway and a short walk from the parking area. No admittance fee. Absolutely one of the most beautiful falls I have ever seen.', \"Not mentioned in every guidebook, this is an up-close-and-personal experience with a high velocity waterfall. Found just back of a small car park beside the 'old road' from Banff to Jasper. No facilities or café/restaurant.... but stop here anyhow!\", 'A must for anyone travelling the icefield parkway, a short flat walk from the car park so within the ability of anyone with mobilty difficulties and so photogenic, particularly this time of year when the melt water is flowing strongly.One recommendation is if you have the time, to take the 93a to or from Jasper. The road is much slower and as such, much quieter. There are far more opportunities to see wildlife and it is nicer to travel at a slower pace', \"You can't visit Jasper and not visit the Athabasca Falls. Well, you can, but you'd be mad to miss out on this. A fantastic example of the raw power of nature, beautiful and awe inspiring. It seems bizarre to think that watching water rush between rocks can be this thrilling.\", \"It is very pretty but go very early or late in the day when it isn't overrun with busloads of others.\", \"Very well-marked trails and informative guidance throughout. All of us tourists are reducing these places' viability!\", 'There are lots of waterfalls in Banff and Jasper National Parks but these are stunning and beautiful and easy for anyone to see. You can hear and feel the power of rushing water when you get near these falls. They are a short ways off the highway and an easy walk from the parking lot. The falls crash into a deep canyon with such force that the area is wet with spray and viewing areas are often a bit slippery. But these falls are well worth a viewing. A reminder of the power of water and the force of nature.', \"Young or old this is a very doable, must see stop on the Icefield parkway. I know there are a million Falls to see but this one is so well layed out that you can see them from all sides. They flow north?!! for 6000 kilometers and enter the Arctic. Can't wrap your head around that but can see this natural wonder up front and personal!\", 'An excellent photo opportunity. Really worth the stop off.

BEAUTIFUL!!! If anyone is in the area of Jasper, be sure to include this stop. The amount of water going over the falls is amazing.

The power of the turbulent water surging over the waterfall and around the rocks was magnificent.', \"Loved these falls. Not suitable for people with poor mobility. Good view of both the 'top' and 'bottom' of the waterfall. Nice simple explanations of geology. Parking was sufficient, toilets nearby. No refreshments nearby offered.\", 'Lovely to see a water fall at eye level instead of from the ground looking up. Lovely scenery around the area as well. Seen many water falls and a lot larger than this one and I would rate it as average at best, but it is still worth a look on your travels especially if you are into this type of thing. Lots of people in cars and buses pull up so it is probably best to get there first thing in the morning if possible.', 'This falls is down inside a rock gorge and makes a 90 degree turn as it falls.

The people, however, were not very smart--despite all the signs everywhere about extreme wildfire hazards, and despite the level 4 drought warnings, people were smoking all over the trails around the falls. I just wish others could use some common sense when in nature. We drove through a region with about 360 wildfires. Why throw gasoline on the fire?', 'This is part of what makes a vacation in the Canadian Rockies such a great experience. The falls are splendid ,the setting is picture perfect with the mountains in the background ,the rushing milky blue waters and the roar of the falls.The sound is captivating as you look with awe at the power of the water.

Very impressive, and you get a real sense of the power of nature. Lots of info on helpful boards, in particular about how dangerous they are, but this didn't stop a daft student perch on the railings to get the perfect selfie - she was lucky she didn't go for a last dive! Definitely recommend! You could spend a good few hours here just watching the water!\", 'You may have heard of it, you may have seen it, but Athabasca Falls is an incredible experience. My wife and I went to see Athabasca Falls recently, but it actually has to be \"experienced\" in person to fully appreciate the power and beauty that it is.

Please do the complete trail which is not very arduous, There is a circle loop to view the falls , the canyon lookout, the pot holes, and a trail down to the river bed. The gushing Athabasca river gushes down and the fine spray of water from certain points is so refreshing.', 'A must see! The wonder of nature. Many photo opts here.

Good views of nearby mountains.', 'Spectacular waterfalls pulsing with frothing turbulence and sparkling power. It was so awesome to watch from high above the water rage through the rock formations. No photos can truly capture the speed of the water as it dashes through the hewn rock walls.', 'Definitely worth a visit, as everything on our self guided (Lonely Planet & info from Visitor Centres) tour seems to be. Easy to access the main area from the car park - OK for wheelchairs & babybuggies. The falls were a raging torrent when we visited, & throwing up rainbows. You can also view from different levels via steps & bridges & see the difference in the water colour where it enters the main river.', 'Close to Jasper (about 20 miles away - close by Canadian standards) and well worth a visit. Make sure to go to the Lower Canyon and enjoy the peace and quiet beyond the falls.', 'Well worth a stop here.

Make sure to keep a close eye on young ones that will climb fencing.\", 'Meet the Athabasca river and its falls at a very close distance. You can also see a small canyon and the big Athabasca river. Nice spot to rest, relax and enjoy the sound of the water through the canyon and waterfall', 'This is a very popular stop on the parkway. It has both a very powerful waterfall and a beautiful canyon.

Great picture overlooks.\", \"Stopping to view these falls, we had no idea what to expect. Wow! The end of the lake tapered to a powerful surge of water pouring over the rocks with an observation bridge above.

Make sure you take your camera because there are plenty of places to take some awesome photos. Well worth the visit.', 'Stunning waterfalls, easy access, good information, all for free. Watch out for mozzies though, they are vicious. Make sure you have insect repellant.', 'One busy place in the summer! This is a stop on the tour bus circuit, so there are swarms of people at times.

There are lots of areas to explore and you can walk down to the river bed below and put your feet in the water. Great stop.', 'On the main road leading to Jasper are these impressive falls on the Athabasca River. While not as big, they seemed as violent and breathtaking as Niagra. There are several well paved paths to gain different vantage points. A steep stair leads to the bottom of the falls that could be omitted if time and agility are a challenge. There are no facilities other than outside toilets at this stop.', 'The Athabasca Falls change a little every time you go, but they never fail to impress. Jasper National Park has made this a wonderful, safe explore. Have been here many times and I am still amazed at water can do to rock.', 'No dislikes..wonderful walks for everyone experienced and non experienced like myself....great for wildlife. The unexpected with the wildlife too appearing on the roads which everyone was aware and drove very carefully. Loved it!', 'The falls are a great treat. Well done paved pathways take you to some lovely spots to see different angles and perspectives of this beautiful location. A must see when visiting the area.', 'The power of nature on display.

We could have stayed for hours had it not been for the thunder and lightning.', 'It is a nice place but I guess compared to other magnificient places in Cdn Rockies, I am just giving it an average score.', 'Must do both. Mt Edith is awesome-can do a fairly easy to moderate walk up close to mtn and glacier (sometimes rd to is not open). Athabasca falls is nice, and an easy walk.

If able, go down the mouth of the falls and sit on the beach, it's gorgeous and so tranquil!\", 'If driving the icefield this is worth a short visit. Well planned trails with about 50 steps to get down to the canyon and a few more to river. However best views are from the top and only takes 10 mins - about as long as it took us to park. Not the most impressive falls but pretty scenery so worth caling', \"Athabasca Falls are about 30 km south of Jasper, so about 1/2 hour drive. The falls have cut a deep canyon. At the main falls there is a lot of spray, so in the mornings, you can often see rainbows in it. Several walk ways allow you to look down into the canyon. At the right time of year you can see the rare calypso orchids growing here. There are signs telling people not to go beyond the barriers, but silly people do - and occasionally someone falls in and dies. Don't go beyond the barriers - the rocks are slippery - the photo isn't worth it.\", 'Easy trail and the spectacular view is totally worth it. We even saw some animals in the way (birds and squirrels).', \"It was smaller than I expected. 10 minute walk around and you've seen it all. Still very pretty though.

After our short hike, we also learned about the wildlife in the area.

We really enjoyed the Athabasca Falls.', \"When we left the carpark to walk along the path to the falls, I thought this doesn't look like it's going to be much of a waterfall. No, it's not in the category of Niagara but it definitely is still awesome in it's own right. The river is wide and the falls are narrow and to see the intensity of the volume of water gushing through was amazing. We walked down the steps to see the water gushing through the canyon to continue into the river at the bottom. Enjoyed visiting this spot and it's an easy walk from the car park\", 'who well go to jasper ..there is some places have to and must have to see athabaca falls on the why only', 'Beautiful falls but be careful!

Easy to access a short walk from the parking lot. One can take a short trail to vother viewpoints as well.', 'A must see! Easy mostly flat paved walk, worth the few mins if takes.

They are of the outhouse sort..but better then the old fashion ones with the moon cut out windows!This should only take 20 mins but there are trails here if you wish to hike around.', 'On the suggestion of the Columbia icefields bus driver, we stopped in at Athabasca Falls. It is a great spot to see the power of running water. Parks Canada has done well with the site to makes sure it is safe for families. It has lots of information on site about the Falls and its continual formation.', 'A very short walk from the parking lot. A fairly powerful little falls. The walk ways take you close enough to feel the spray of the falls. Wonderful sounds of nature! No reason to pass this one by.', 'This beautiful fall, although not too high, but created over centuries, many small, but complicated openings due to the soft rocks. Spending a few hours trying to understand the geological puzzle of cutting the rocks, due to shear force of water, over years, can earn you a doctoral degree. So, enjoy the beauty of the fall and leave your mind for the imagination !!', 'My family (young son, wife) and I visited many falls in our travels and this is one of the best in terms of viewing and proximity to the fall itself (while maintaining safety). There are a few viewpoints that are easily access from the parking lot. Needless to say, it is a busy place during the summer, but not overcrowded in my opinion.', \"Great opportunity to stand on a glacier. Temp was 95 degrees day we were there. On the glacier it was about 40 degrees. You can see five glaciers from one viewpoint. The skywalk shouldn't be missed. The also have a restaurant and cafe.\", 'I took my four year old to the falls. It was easy to get to and the pathways around the falls were well maintained and easy to follow. Excellent views and photo opportunities.', 'We stopped off to see the falls when driving from jasper to lake Louise. The falls were spectacular in June as there was quite a good flow to the river. For me the most interesting part of the falls was the old discussed falls. Thousands of years ago the water changed course to the new falls. So you can now walk down the old falls canyon. You can see the years upon years of water against rock fighting against each other.', 'The falls are magnificent in their splendor. Viewing and hearing the sound of cascading water splashing downward and over the fallen rocks along with forming rainbows at just about at every turn, is breathtaking. Be sure and notice how the water, over a great number of years, has carved through the rocks. The falls are only about a 40 minute drive from Jasper and are well worth the visit. There is no charge for viewing or parking.', 'We were travelling from Jasper to Lake Louise and had heard seeing the Falls was a worthwhile detour and it certainly was. Given the melting snow, the Falls were impressive to see.', 'Beautiful place!\\nEven on a cloudy and rainy day it was beautiful. I imagine it in winter how amazing it would be.\\nWorth a stop.', 'The Athabasca Falls are spectacular and definitely warrant a 45 minute stop while traveling the Icefields Parkway in Jasper National Park. They are memorable because of the erosion of the rocks along the sides of the falls.', 'This is a very easy walk to see the falls from several angles. Signs explained the color of the water and the surrounding areas. If you were willing you could make an easy walk down to where the falls emptied into a large river.

Can get very close to feel the power of the raging water.', 'June is a good time the melt waters are still coming, but not in huge spring quantities, all adds to the attraction. Take time to walk around and enjoy, away from the crowds.', \"Too many tourists stop when they see the falls, thinking that's all there is to see.

It's also a great spot to have your photo taken or to take a selfie.\", 'Be sure to visit all levels of the fall. This is the best one in the park. Also go up to the ice fields on the east end.

Lots of photo opportunities, but watch all the mist on your lenses!', 'Not the biggest falls by any means but the setting and the splendour of the falls makes it a spot not to miss', 'It is so amazing the power water has on rock. The erosion from centuries of flow is very prevalent and leaves you in awe.

No fee once you are in the park.', 'Liked: views, great place to get some good pictures.\\nDislikes: too many people and a lot of dogs when we went.', 'Impressive but busy. Parking was a major challenge. However, the spray from the falls was natural air conditioning on a very hot day.', 'The falls are simply beautiful! Well worth the stop. It is certainly a place to stop and spend some time at. We were there for about 45 minutes.', 'Having read reviews on Trip we decided to stop off to stretch our legs and it was well worth it. Only a short walk from the car park to see the full force in all its glory is s treat', \"These falls are some of the best I've seen. Unlike Niagara Falls they thunder through a rather small opening and then travel through a canyon with more falls and whirlpools before eventually flowing out into a wide river below. Make sure you walk all around as there are many advantage spots to view these falls. Just off the Icefields Parkway so very easy to get to.\", 'One of our favourite sites that we visited whilst in the Jasper area.Great torrents of water and fantastic viewing points where you can really experience the power of the water.Also an interesting opportunity to walk through an expired section where the water previously ran and a view of the river after the falls', 'Visited here today and the river was raging over the falls. Huge amounts of water and it was a very impressive sight. Not too busy, good parking, easy access. Would definitely recommend to anyone on the Icefields Parkway!', 'Each time we go to Athabasca Falls we get a sense of magnificence. The overwhelming power of the water, the etched stones from hundreds of years of pounding and the beautiful figures carved into the stone from the whirlpools continue to amaze. When you go, be sure to take the side paths down to the basin. Most of the visitors only go to the lookouts so taking the paths less travelled will truly take you into the past and allow you to enjoy the pounding water and otherwise total silence of this lovely area.If you have children, please be careful to watch them closely as there are lots of access points that would be easy for the children to climb and fall over. Your children will, as those we watched during our visit, be amazed and curious and love the fact that they have to yell at their parents to be heard over the rush of water around them. Enjoy!', \"Athabasca Falls is on the Icefields Parkway about a half hour out of Jasper, and if you're driving that way, you must stop there! They are phenomenal. It's only a two minute drive from the highway and a five minute walk after that. Someone has out a lot of care into the boardwalk and bridge over the falls. The trees have been cleared just enough to give you great views from all sorts of angles, and they've attended to your other senses as well, with one little nook where the roarnif the waterfall is amplified and another where you can stand in the spray (try it, it's fun!). Things are well-marked (the sign at the start of the trail down to the base of the waterfall even reminds you that you will have to come up again!) and well-maintained.

Plenty of great photo opportunities from each side of the falls. The reminder of a fatality on the seating showed how dangerous the falls could be.', \"Beautiful, large glacier. It's a quick stop and then a bit of a hike if you want to get a nicer view. It's quite windy, so I'd wear a jacket.\", \"Pictures can not justify the beauty of this place! Loved it. Be careful and don't fall over - they will never find your body in all that whirlpool at the bottom. Other then safety precautions - this place is amazing. Loved the stairs - so cool. We were camping and took a trip to check out the falls. A must see in Jasper. xx\", \"Great stop on your way up to Jasper. We didn't have time to stop on way the Icefields Parkway but made sure we stopped on our way back to Calgary. I glad we didn't miss it. Very pretty.

This fall is amazing like every lake and Avery corner of this park. Super paradise!\", 'This is a must if you are in the area. I think these must be the most gushing falls on the Icefields Parkway. Be careful - access is not easy in places as the path is slippery and there are steps. But it is certainly worth the climb if you can manage the steps.', \"If you're a nature-lover, a visit to Athabasca Falls will not disappoint. There are several view decks on a well-designed walkway.\", \"Only a short drive outside Jasper. We visited in early June, well before the heavy tourist season. It's amazing to see the power of the water and you can feel the ground and lookouts tremble from the flow. No complaints here, but I could see the lookouts, trails and bridges being very crowded during high season.\", \"Lovely views and scenery. Worth a visit and don't forget to take your camera. High volume of water when we visited. Would recommend a visit\", \"Great stop along the road. The river is gently flowing until it roars over the falls plunging into a deep canyon. There are locations were the water has swirled and eroded the rocks to create 'pot holes' and there are many locations to view various portions of the river and canyon. Easy trail and rest rooms available.\", 'In normal circumstances these falls would be a must see but, as there are so many wonderful sights along this route, you need to consider whether to include this. Preferably youu should and allow at least 30 minutes for your visit.', 'Well worth stopping at the Athabasca Falls. Amazing how all this water snakes its way down the gorge. Easy access. Fantastic scenery. Our day was all the more amazing by having a rainbow appear above our heads in a photograph!', \"A must see if you're in Jasper! It's set up really well to view the falls and there are a few different paths you can take to see the lake etc. Really beautiful, I would love to go back again! Great view of the mountains as well.\", 'We particularly enjoyed the sculptured potholes and the rock formations created by the force of the water.', 'Seeing these falls was an amazing experience. Be careful not to miss the turnout because it is not very well marked. The falls just roar through the rocks and then you can take a quick hike down to see where they come out into a wide river that is a beautiful silt-filled blue.', 'Absolutely beautiful. It is a must stop on the way to Jasper. (About 20 min. from town of Jasper. Gorgeous area around the falls with walkway. Perfect picture taking areas.', 'Just of Hwy93 - free parking, washroom facilities, easy access to viewing areas. The falls are quite small but very dramatic. The walkways let you see the falls from different viewpoints and they are wheelchair friendly too.', 'Great location to view the incredible change in the river from fast flowing to thunderous waterfall. I think the early explorers must have had some fear when they saw the mist from the Falls as they were approaching this feature.Make sure when you have seen the Falls and if heading back to Jasper, you take the old 93A back. This is the old Icefields Parkway road and can offer some incredible wildlife and scenery if taken later in the day when the temperatures are cooler.', 'A tourist stop on the Highway between Jasper and lake Louise these falls are well presented in that there are good walkways so you can see and enjoy the falls', 'Easy access from car park, and the best waterfall have ever seen. A must do for travellers to this area.', 'What can one say about this incredible falls. It winds through the rock formation and forms swirling cul-de-sac like cuts in the rock. A very good place to visit in Jasper National Park.', \"This is one of the popular stops on the road between Lake Louise and Jasper. Its only a short walk to the falls which are quite spectacular especially as it was mid-snow melt when we visited. There are great pathways and bridges so you can check it out from various vantage points. A red squirrel wasn't worried about the bus load of other tourists around. We also had a chat to the National Park rangers who had an educational display near the car park.\", 'This is one of the prettiest falls in Jasper. The intricately carved slot Ravine just across the bridge at the Falls is really a sight to see as well.', 'We visited in June and the water levels were very high. The falls are stunning and you can get a variety of views from in front and behind. Allow at least 30 minutes.\\nNot to be missed, if you are anywhere near.', 'Beautiful water falls. Steep in areas. Nice pathway. Need to keep close eye on children while visiting.', 'Nice waterfalls. We did not walk the entire path but waterfalls deserve a look. These falls are close to Jasper.', \"Definitely worth stopping off for 20 minutes en route to Jasper. Compared to Johnson Canyon it is a brief and easy (five minute) walk from the spacious car park to get the best views of the falls, and at 6pm on a Friday evening was not too overrun with tourists. As others have said, photos do not do it justice. The impressive thunderous noise, the spray, the rainbow effects created, the marvellous rocky and forested backdrop, the milky white Athabasca River - it's energising and inspiring - and so accessible (for able bodied folk). Just be careful with the steps further along the trail which lead down to the river. They can get muddy and slippery if it is/has been raining. We arrived just after a heavy downpour and had to watch our step!\", 'A nice stop and a ahort walk to the falls. Not overrun. To get there use the less busy 97A. The walk is an easy 1 km stroll along the falls. You really get very close.', \"The falls are located in a lovely park setting with clean restrooms, picnic areas and a short walk to view the falls from several different locations, all stunning....a very nice place to stop for a rest....although be mindful of bears.....and it's free!!!!\", 'The roar of the falls and the movement of water in the air cannot be captured by photos. These falls are definitely worth a stop. Make sure you take the time to walk the well paved paths to above and below the falls. Parking was easy and we were lucky enough to be there when there were no tour buses so we had plenty of space to enjoy it. I also marvelled at the beautiful rocks and trees. We spent about 30 minutes there and had had plenty of time for photos and walking the paths.', 'Worth the stop as the falls are amazing & incredibly beautiful. Short walk from car park & worth a break as the force of water is phenomenal. Very beautiful too.', 'Crashing falls and a great walk around the area easily accessible with plenty of parking. Well worth a visit.', 'Athabasca Falls are one of the main tourist attractions on the Icefields Parkway, Hwy 93, between Jasper and Lake Louise. Access is very easy from the highway. Parking is freely available. The paths to the main viewpoints are wheelchair friendly, although other paths are not suitable. The size of the falls vary with the season, in June with the snow melt and runoff, the volume and speed of the water is spectacular. The paths are well fenced and very safe for all the family.', 'You must stop by these falls they are so pretty and so close to the road, as well there is a parking spot and rest rooms there', 'The Athabasca Falls are small but a powerful, picturesque waterfall. Athabasca Falls is not known so much for the height of the falls (23 meters), as it is known for its force due to the large quantity of water falling into the gorge. We viewed the falls safely and photographed it from various viewing platforms and walking trails around the falls.', 'A lovely rustic location. The falls has several bridges and a few walking paths. No interpretive facilities. Plan to be self directed and definitely observe all safety signage and guard rails. Bring a nice camera. Also be sure to check in out in the winter, the frozen water makes amazing patterns.', 'A short walk from the Icefields Parkway, a beautiful, powerful waterfall roars down the mountains. When the sun hits the spray, viewers are treated to a beautiful rainbow which is easily captured in photographs. The view is captivating, and if you can tear yourself away from this view, the trail continues on for the more fit and adventurous.', \"Stunning with lots of trail walking opportunities. Falls were very accessible and it's possible to sit by the steams\", \"This was such an amazing sight. Our children loved it and our driver had some great stories about this waterfall that really captured our children's imaginations. Seeing this waterfall from several angles is a must. From one angle, the water falls in such a way that it creates an stunning rainbow. We loved this!\", \"This area is beautiful! And without all that icky tackiness of Niagara Falls! The parking lot is big. There's washrooms (well, outhouses, but whatever, they're outdoors). One washroom door was busted with no lock so beware! It was raining when we went but still good to see. The cement pathways are uneven and as a result, water from the rain made huge puddles keeping us from walking everywhere. But hopefully you get to go on a nice day where this isn't an issue! There's a lot of mist and the temperature drops a little!There are boards all over providing educational information regarding the falls and the pot holes. You can walk through a cavern-like part which had formally been battered by the same water from the falls many, many years ago. You can look at the walls and marvel at the might of the rock and the force it endured. The pothole was interesting too...but looked a bit gross what with old, stagnant water being in it. You can keep walking down some very steep steps and get to the river where we seen excited people start rafting. I wouldn't recommend doing this when it's raining like we did because of how slippery and narrow it was. There's fences all over and past warnings not to leave the designated areas, because it's both dangerous AND destorys the environment by destroying the rocks and grass! There was a bench in memory to a young 21 year old man who fell off of those falls to his death. I felt it was a heartfilled gestured by his loved ones and a good reminder to stay safe! You must check this place out. It's a mighty falls despite not being as big as Niagara. I can see why so many love it!\", 'Highly turbulent water in a massive volume from the Athabasca River. You need to watch your step and stick to the path as this place has claimed the lives of those who took risks. Well worth the visit.', \"Where do you start. Trying to describe the sound of the thundering water and volume of water that is cascading over the falls is near impossible. Just stand there, watch and listen.This is the power of water as the river funnels into a narrow canyon and down between the rocks sending up fine mist sprays.The park is easy accessible by car from highway 93, south of Jasper. Take care to follow the pathway and don't cross the fences as it can be a very dangerous.This is a must see on your Canadian Rockies adventure.\", \"Because it was such a short distance to the falls, I wasn't expecting much, so boy, was I surprised. These falls are very impressive. You can stay with 95% of the visitors and feel very claustrophobic viewing them or you walk walk a little ways and get a different view and less people. You can also walk downstream a ways and see the immediate calmness after the falls. It is a great little stop. Don't miss it.\", 'You need to see how the force of the water carved out the stone..amazing! Loved the beauty of the waterfalls and the power it generated.', 'Pretty much a must see if you are in the area. Spectacular view and great place to take a lot of photos. If you are there in the early a.m. make sure you use mosquito repellent, the mosquitoes are thick.', 'Athabasca Falls is a very pretty waterfall and canyon close to Jasper. It’s a short walk from the parking lot to the falls, with a couple of views of the Athabasca River along the way, flowed by a nice view of the falls. Then you reach a bridge across the river below the falls, and three viewpoints of the falls on the far side of the river. Finally, there is a trail to the lower canyon for better views of the canyon itself. We spent an hour here, enjoying the view and taking photos and could have stayed longer. Note — there is no running water or drinking fountains here, so come prepared!', 'For some reason it is hard to describe what makes these falls so interesting, the thunder of the water, the sheer volume going over the falls, but this is one of the places you must see in Jasper.', 'These falls are beautiful! A great place for a walk to stretch your legs, an easy short hike from the parking area. We loved how accessible these were.', \"Worth a visit, if you're on the road it's a stone's throw from route 93, and everything is right there. There isn't really a hike just different bits you walk round/different angles to look at it. Then if you go down you can meet the lake at the bottom which is very pretty.\", 'We loved these falls, more spectacular than the swapta ones. Beware of the mosquitos though there were many!!!!', 'Its just a couple of minutes walk from the car park and totally worth the effort, the falls are powerful and simply stunning.', 'What an example of the power of water. As the river funnels into a narrow chasm in the rocks, it thunders over the falls, sending up a spray, and creating rainbows.', 'Every time I visit Jasper I always stop and visit Athabasca Falls. Its beauty never ceases to amaze me. It can get very crowded so its best to go early morning or later in the afternoon. Definitely worth a stop even if you only have a few minutes.', \"Love Athabasca Falls! Don't miss out on this one, just a beautiful spot of nature and a nice drive to get there as well!\", 'Beautiful canyons and falls just a very short easy walk from the car park. Go early to avoid the crowds a must see.', 'Athabasca Falls are all about the raw power of nature! Just tons and tons of water smashing down below!\\nThere are numerous paths to explore the area, but like Maligne Canyon the water is the reason you visit!', \"It is just off the main highway and it is definitely worth a stop. Can view the falls from both sides of the river. Also made a trip down to the water's edge. The path down was cut by water long ago and it was an awesome sight. It was an easy walk up and down although there was a warning sign about the number of steps down.\", 'Athabasca Falls is worth stopping for. The power of the falls and the immense canyons will take your breath away. Just wonderful.', 'Beautiful and powerful! There was even a rainbow in one area of the falls! A definite must see on the Icefield Parkway!', 'If you like waterfalls (I do) then these falls are not to be missed. Not huge, but quite spectacular, with a lot of water going over them. About a 200m walk from the car park, so not far to walk on firm tarmac.', 'The falls are just beautiful! It is a nice place to walk around, great scenery. Definitely worth a visit.', \"How can anyone give this 3 stars as average? It's really impressive and well worth a visit as there is a lot to see. We drove from Banff to jasper but went on the glacier and skywalk tours so did not visit the falls on the way up. Once in jasper we went back, about half an hour, to see the falls and I'm glad we did it that way as we could appreciate them more.\", \"Athabasca Falls and its canyon makes an extraordinary site. Come and get impressed, inspired by the force of nature. I've been here a couple of times and always I have the feelings of wonder. The park is easy accessible by car from hwy 93 South of Jasper. There are pathways around the waterfalls and steps through the canyon for you see this monument of nature from different angles.\", \"Nature at it's most powerful. The roar of the falls is a great reminder of the strength of Mother Nature.\", 'Just a short drive from Jasper, with a bear sighting on the way... the falls are beautiful.

I would highly recommend it - make sure you bring your camera.', 'Just another wonderful experience on our trip through the Rockies. This was enhanced by the wonderful bus driver and company', 'This is a not miss attraction, the rush of water was beautiful and noisy, and although I could not walk the full walk what I saw will remain with me', \"About the only thing that keeps this site from being a 5 star is the lack of information and history of the site. The entrance to the Falls is well marked. There is plenty of parking. The majority of the paved paths are easy for anyone to move over. The grade is relatively flat. However, there are steps and some unusual rock formations in the outer areas that could challenge folk with unsteady legs/feet. But, if you don't have problems getting around, I can highly recommend you explore the path that follows the river until it flows into the wider river...about 100 yds.Certainly a place to see on your way to or from Jasper!\", \"Not the biggest or best, wildest or wettest but it is a great example of where a big river hits rock and cuts it way through creating a torrent. If you are in the area it's a must do stop. Watch out for Mosquitos in lower river area\", 'We were overrun by rude Asian tourists who insisted on forcing their way between my camera lens and the falls.', 'When travelling on my Canada trip with my mum abs sisterThe visit was on my own tour just gif info from research and went for itDid the trip to Canary coach to Banff 2 days then coach to jasper 2 nights before our rocky mountaineer to Vancouver', 'The falls were awesome.

Great viewing platforms giving a wide range of views of the Falls.\", \"I have been to Athabasca Falls numerous times throughout my life. It never gets boring!This spot is great for anyone. You can view the falls from the top, and if you're more agile, walk down the stairs to the river at the bottom. There are a couple of trail heads from this site, so look ahead to plan your day. Remember to have fun, but respect the signs and fences; don't end up dead for the sake of a picture.\", \"Athabasca falls is very beautiful and the drive out to the falls is worth doing on it's own. Like many other places in Jasper there are informative signs everywhere, helping you learn and understand more. The facilities at the falls were well kept and clean.

Because of this, I would recommend going earlier or later in the day.\", 'A very pretty spot, but stay in bounds, dont be dumb and die. Easy access and a beautiful walk fun for all ages.', \"This beautiful falls are just on the way between Jasper and the Colombia ice field. great place to stop for a break, enjoy the nature and even have a picnic there. you can find a lot of parking, tables, washrooms and great atmosphere , and it's all for free.\", \"I've always liked to gaze at natural waterfalls, and this one certainly didn't disappoint.

We didn\\'t have to do a thing, the young man who handled the navigation did it all single handedly. The \"rapids\" weren\\'t nearly as bad as I thought they might have been, but that doesn\\'t detract from the skill of our young person. I enjoyed getting sprayed, others, not so much. Great fun, great experience.', 'This a must see if the raw power of nature is what you an to see, great place to take that one of a kind photo!The earlier in the year the better the falls will be as the amount of water going through this area is more in the Spring than in the fall,but at any time this a great place to spend time.Take care to follow the pathway and do not cross the fences as it can be a very dangerous place to any one not acquainted with the power of water. So be careful and enjoy one of the true wonders of the Canadian Rockies!', \"Another of those sights when you visit The Rockies that make you say wow! Well worth a visit.

Edith Cavel and the road there was closed due to construction so we proceeded to Athabasca Falls. the walk was easy and the sights were beautiful. Not as long as Maligne canyon and easier if you have mobility problems. Great for a short hike.', \"We have seen Athabasca Falls on every one of our trips to Jasper.

A little bit of snow and ice on the ground - if you're unsteady on your feet - it's not a good idea to venture beyond the main falls.

We stopped in at the falls while in the Jasper area skiing at Marmot Basin. There was a lot of ice on the pathways, but with care we were able to get around to all the viewpoints.

Shouldn't miss it because it is very close to Parkway, and a very short and easy trail hike. Nothing strenuous.\", 'The sounds of the water flowing and falling is enough to make Athabasca Falls a place to visit. The rock formations are huge!The rainbow you see is also a bonus. Our kids were amazed to see this marvel of nature that is the Athabasca Falls.', \"Easy to find off of a map! Short trail! Beautiful scenery! We went here in the winter and it was breath taking so I can't even imagine in the summer! It was a nice small activity to enjoy, the falls were beautiful and the mountains superb as ever!! Really enjoyed coming here :)\", 'The Athabasca Falls is between Jasper and Lake Louise and Hwy #1 Hwy #93 crossing by. Amazing water Falls. Just have to walk there.', \"You don't have to be there for long to get great views. The trail is short, but the falls are breathtaking.\", 'Very impressive waterfall with walking paths. the nice spots for taking photos are always filled with mist from the fall so a go-pro or something else waterproof you can quickly wipe down is the way to go. If you have a choice of time for the visit, early morning or later afternoon are best as during the day, this place can be super busy and you have to focus more on not to bump into people than the massive falls.', 'Fabulous scenery. So dramatic! A must see. If you can fit it in it is not to be missed. Look for bears.', 'We stopped at Athabasca Falls en route from Jasper to Lake Louise. A boardwalk takes you along the river from where the rapids begin to the thundering torrent that is the main attraction here. Along the way, you experience many vantage points and photo opportunities. Tour was by SunDog, excellent driver/commentator, nice clean little transport.', 'Oh so beautiful. You take a walk down and just the size of the trees and the sound of the water gushing/rushing is so incredible.', \"Really impressive don't miss it.\\nCan get busy but walk along the tracks further up the falls and it's less busy\", 'we went as part of a snow mobile safari and stopped off here as part of the whole day trip, which included breakfast and a superb buffet dinner at the end, with coffee served from a huge enameled pot - just like in the westerns on TV.', 'This thundering waterfall is amazing to see. Free to visit and just off the main Jasper-Banff road. Thousands of tonnes of water pouring through a narrow neck in the river. Worth a look!', 'Spectacular waterfall viewing just off the Icefields Parkway, near Jasper. This small hiding trail is easily accessible for those who are not able to manage longer hikes. Definitely worth stopping and checking out.', '????????????\\n????????????????????...\\nThe best time to watch this falls is during summer time.\\nawesome falls!', 'It a short walk to view the falls, however bring slip on cleats to put on your shoes as the path is quite icy.', 'These falls were pretty intense! There was a lot of water coming down over them, and the canyon it has created was quite pretty!', 'Important to see this. Spectacular and many nooks and crannies to explore. There is also a pleasant walk above the falls.', 'I have been here many times and never get tired of it. Very popular place for tourists and tour buses so it can sometimes get a little crowded. Great location for photographs.', 'Athabasca Falls is just one stop on the Icefield Parkway. A winding road stretching from Banff to Jasper. An amazing route thru the glaciers where you can get up close with these natural wonders. Take a walk up on a glacier, dip you hand in a fresh glacier fed stream. Some of these streams, including the one of the Athabasca Glacier collect and flow thru the Athabasca Falls. It is amazing to see. Dress warm, this water does not get warm even mid summer. A must see.', 'The Athabasca Falls are definitely worth a stopover on the way to/from Jasper. It is amazing to see how the force of the water has carved thru solid rock to form the falls, and the canyon below.The trail is easy to negotiate and located not far from the car-park. It leads to various viewpoints and allows views from different aspects of the raging falls. If you choose to walk a little further into the trail, you will come to a viewpoint where you may be sprayed with water, depending on the time of year you visit.', 'Plunging at a height of 23 metres, this powerful and picturesque waterfall is simply magnificent. Standing at different viewpoints, you can feel the strong force of nature with a close encounter of the loud roaring sound and the blue turquoise water splashing into the deep gorge.', 'You drive up to an unassuming parking lot wondering if just beneath the surface lay something worth stopping here. You head up a paved trail and you find yourself greeted by one of Canada\\'s most secretive treasures. In what seems like the middle of nowhere (unannounced by anything more than a modest sign that screams: \"There is absolutely nothing to see here\"), rests something wonderous that will have Christians and Evolutionists reheating the debate because what you will see is inexcusable! This kind of natural beauty can be captured on film and digital media, but to understand the true essence of it, you simply have to be there!', \"Very lovely natural landmark. They've built in some excellent pathways that allow for different angle views of the falls, and that lets you get close enough to feel the spray and hear the roar.\", 'The blue/green river, the waterfalls and the mountains beyond were spectacular. There were several paths you could take to see the falls from different angles.', \"This is a must see if you are the Icefields Highway. It's a nice way to take a quick break on the long road. The falls are a once in a life time visit and the glacier blue hue of the water is stunning.\", 'These falls were worth stopping at, powerful water lots of good photos. The glacial water was wonderful with rainbows & gushing water. Watch where you walk as it is dangerous', \"Dont drive there just to see this. If it's on the way, you may spend some time. Nothing exceptional about it. You can find better places.\", 'a nice rest area with a nice waterfall. would be way better in the summer than in October after some hard frost but a nice walk around none the less.', 'If you are a nature lover , this is one of the places to visit for colorful waters surrounded by rocky terrain', 'It was a beautiful day and there are a lot of spots to take good photos of the falls and rushing water!', 'We started our journey on the Parkway with our first stop at the falls. They were beautiful and the power they have is amazing. We were there early and beat the tour buses to the site. There were a lot of people visiting but they have several spots to view them and see the power of the water on the rocks around them. This is a stop you must make.', 'All around here is stunning, you could some it up as trees, water and mountains, but that would not give credence to the awesome views.', \"We went in November and it had just snowed! It's not a gigantic fall but with the snow it was so lovely. The water was actually turquoise too.\\nThere are alot of paths around.\", 'We visited the falls very early in the morning as the sun was rising, and would definitely recommend going at that time - the falls are absolutely stunning and we got some amazing photos. Very accessible from the car park and well worth a visit.', \"After you've seen the falls, look at the size of the river upstream or downstream and try to imagine all the water going through the narrow waterfall\", 'A spectacular falls which is easily accessible from the carpark. Lots of water rushing over the boulders and down into the valley.', 'Close to the main highway, these falls are awesome, especially as they seem to burrow into the stone below. Lots of places to take a good photo and the glacial water makes all look extra beautiful.', \"It's a lovely full-bodied waterfall, mini-Niagara. It is easily accessible for great views, and there is an option to descend to the bottom of the fall through amazing rock formations that look surreal.\", \"very powerful waterfall, even at the end of Sept. Can only imagine what it's like in May with the spring runoff\", 'Very pretty falls, offering some walking trails down to the river as well as the main falls themselves', 'Yes indeed, this is worth stopping for. Lovely lake and amazing mountains are the backdrop for an really powerful waterfall. Lots of different viewing platforms with interesting stories relating to the falls.', 'A breathtaking view of waterfalls and the sounds of nature This is a major stopping point for most tours and for a very good reason.A truly spectacular photo stop', 'Yet another beautiful scenic experience well worth another bus break.different view points to capture the most of this waterfall . We were so lucky with weather.although a popular tourist attraction worth the crowd - most are accommodating when needing a photograph!!', 'Definitely is a must to stop by. Beautiful waterfalls but the best time to go when its quieter and less people, then it makes much more special and place to visit. Great spot for photography. Highly recommend it.', 'Be sure to walk all around to get all perspectives - very beautiful. If you see a lot of buses in the parking lot, try to change when you go to view - gets very crowded at the best view spots', \"Easy parking and well signposted walks along the falls. Care needed as paths can be slippery. Beautiful and a 'must visit' site in the Rockies!\", \"A nice falls which are easy to access from the highway. It really only takes a few minutes to see the falls. This area, however, does see a lot of tour bus and general traffic. If you stop, you will encounter a large number of people. If your looking for a peaceful, little spot near Athabasca Falls try Honeymoon Lake. My favorite spot in Jasper National Park is the Mount Lady Cavell area. It's located about 30 minutes or so from Athabasca Falls. If you have a little time, you may wish to take the scenic route to Jasper down Highway 93 A. You'll leave a lot of traffic behind and there's some nice scenery along the way. Also, Mount Lady Cavell is located just off 93A.\", \"Our tour bus briefly stopped here. It was a little disappointing if you have seen numerous waterfalls in the past. This is more about the volume of water going over the falls than how the falls look. If you're strapped for time give it a miss.\", \"Yet another beautiful 'must see' site in the Rockies.Make sure you see all of it and cross under the road. Mother Nature at her very best.\", 'The falls are nice and, because they’re right off the highway, are definitely worth a look. However, depending on the day and time, you could run into a lot of people packed into a tight little viewing area.By all means, get up close to the falls and get your pictures and all that. But also make some time to stroll on the worn paths alongside the Athabasca River. You’ll get away from the crowds and the scenery is unreal: the glittering river rolling toward the falls, with the sharp peaks close on the horizon.If you have a half hour to spend here, I’d recommend taking five minutes to snap a few shots of the falls, and spend the rest of the time walking along the river. For me, the falls was the appetizer and the stroll along the water was the main course.', 'Visited the falls in September 2014, easy access to see the falls for the disabled, beautiful scenery.', 'A great stopping place with falls, rivers and walkways. Well worth a stop and good photo opportunities.', 'Stopped to view falls when driving between Jasper and Banff and were pleased we did. Located very close to the main road they provided a pretty spectacular sight, especially as the waters had not really been flowing very strongly in many other locations the strength and power of the falls was very impressive.Well worth breaking your journey to see.', \"Driving between Lake louise and Jasper is arguably the best drive in the world with OMG moments all along the Icefield Pathway. The Athabasca falls is another of these moments. Very glad we spent time visiting all these great places including Athabasca Falls- don't miss it\", 'We decided to stop and check this out. Sooooo glad we did. Words and pictures cannot describe how beautifully magnificent these falls are.', 'Lovely walk beside this roaring, powerful river. I enjoyed walking down the steps in the old canyon, and seeing the rock formations on the canyon walls.', 'Stopped off to visit Athabasca Falls (30kms from Jasper), just off the HWY and well worth seeing. They are not too spectacular but they just take a minutes to get there from the motorway. The entire area is quite scenic.', 'Easy to get in and out so definitely stop here. Free parking in the lost and very well marked trails for different perspectives.', 'The parkway seems to go on forever and there are so many great sights to see, so it is tempting to pass a few bay. But I recommend you dont miss this very pleasant stroll to see the lake and the falls. I was just looking at my videos and photos from my canada trip last year and remembering how lovely the falls were to visit. Especially when you have been driving a lot in the car. It is great to get out and stretch your legs in this lovely area. Just a short stroll from the car park the walk ways are well kept and there is easy access to walk around the falls and see the lake. Great views of the falls and signs with pictures and information let you know lots of information about the flora and fauna. The wildlife is never far away. We were able to sit and watch a squirrel as he sat on a branch in perfect Tufty poise with his tail curled up his back.', \"It's very beautiful. The glacial blue water in the summer is of extreme beauty. Can spend hours on a bench just listening to the rush of the waters or walking down only 100 meters to the calm end of the fall\", 'Kind of busy with the bus tours and all, but worth a stop on the way to or from somewhere. Stroll along the path to get away from the camera commandos and high heel and bear bell crowd.', \"We did a tour from jasper, with sundog. The guide was very good, just enough information without overload. The falls are beautiful. Worth the walk don't forget your camera.\", 'A delightful stop! Beautiful view of waterfalls and potholes that the rushing water makes. Aqua water falls off like an infinity pool...a really amazing experience and walkway....definitely a must! A highlight of the Jasper area.', 'Great falls and many good viewing platforms. Get there early if possible so you keep ahead of all the bus loads.', 'We just happened to pull into to Falls while traveling from Jasper to Banff. We are so glad we did! There are lots of easy foot paths to walk on. You can easily get to various points of the falls. There are lots of informative signs. Take a few minutes to walk down through the rocks where the river used to flow.', 'Just beautiful. Make sure you walk down to the lower canyon. You can walk right up to the waters edge. Gorgeous views there!', 'A short hike from the parking lot will take you to the falls. Great viewing locations of the falls and surrounding mountains.', 'Nothing to dislike about this site well may be the toilets are primitive. The falls are amazing and very photogenic!', 'This is a stunning waterfall even when the river level is low, but not the best in the area. Alao be sure to go to maligne canyon and Sunwapta falls which is just further down on the Icefields Parkway be sure to go to the upper and lower falls..', \"An impressive amount of water over the falls even tho' it was at the end of summer. A free attraction and we walked all around the falls and in the gullies for about 3/4 of an hour.\", 'We had a quick stop here, but it was long enough for a photo. There were toilets too, but not much else.', 'We visited these falls while we were staying in Jasper and loved them. We would definitely recommend a visit as they are stunning and probably even more stunning in the spring when the snow is melting and adding to the volume of water passing over them.', 'Took a guided tour of the ice fields, fantastic experience and top class information from our guide, a must do experience especially if you are interested in the environment and effects of Globalisation.', 'One of don\\'t miss sights along the Icefields Parkway, a little outside of Jasper. The paths are all paved and you can view the falls from both sides. It isn\\'t a particular \"big\" waterfall, but a forceful one as can be witnessed by the carved out rock.', 'Best waterfalls I have ever seen, very calm and soothing, well worth the trip and little walk/hike. Loved the chance to be able to walk down to the river and feel the cold blue/green water, very beautiful', 'I enjoyed a quick stop at this falls. It was near the parking lot and well worth a stop to see the falls and canyon.', 'Well worth a visit. Major photo opportunity and well managed site with amenities. Just a nice place to hang out and spend some tie watching the World go by.', 'Having had many deaths over the years at these falls the authorities have been very sympathetic in applying health and safety at the site. True the railing do detract from the natural beauty and sort of shepherd you around but when the rivers in full flood then these falls are not only spectacular but also frightening for the faint of heart.That said, we were mesmerised by the beauty and the sheer power of the water as it made its was from a gentle undulating flow to a destructive torrent in about twenty feet.There is a full walkway that allows you to see the first part of the falls from both sides and they are simply stunning. For those more adventurous there are steps that take you all the way down to the river basin with a few off-shoots along the way - the majority of it all is extremely photogenic and I would whole heartedly recommend it to everyone in the area.', \"If you're in the area, travelling along the Icefields Parkway, then a stop off at the Athabasca falls is a good idea. There is no entrance fee, and plenty of free parking. Access is very good on foot, and the falls themselves are interesting to see: there is an old dry section where the river has diverted naturally, and the effects of the water flow on the rock formations are clearly visible.\", 'A short stop for those either in or out of Jasper. Right off the hwy. This isn\\'t a hike as all the paths are paved and easily accessible. Some of the views at the bottom as the lake trails off into the distance is breathtaking. The waterfall is beautiful, if perhaps a little \"touristy\", but with that allows families and everyone to enjoy the magnificence that is the Rockies in a safe environment. Recommend.', 'Fences line the whole route. For good reason as have been a number of deaths but feel it has taken away the naturalness of the area. Good sight but better in the area.', 'A free place to visit just 30km out of Jasper down the Icefields Parkway. Definitely worth a stop. Not a \"big\" fall but its design is interesting and the platforms allow you to get very close. A worthwhile 30-minute stop.', 'Thundering water and just off the highway and well worth the stop. Walk across the bridge to the other side for the best views.', 'Beautiful water falls set in spectacular scenery. A short stroll around to see some fabulous geology.', 'We had a lovely walk to the falls and read all the information supplied on the boards in the area. Would have liked to have stayed longer but we were with a group on a coach and so had to be back at a certain time.', \"we did this hike and loved it even though the weather was rainy and on the cool side. it was crowed, but we were there over a holiday wk end. Since it is spread out, I didn't think it was overly crowded, BUT others did.\", 'A beautiful experience, awe inspiring. We always go back here when we are in the area. Well worth the drive.', 'Just a short walk from the carpark and good stop off point on your trip along the spectacular Icefields Parkway near to Jasper.', 'Easy to find, clean toilet facilities for travellers and the most stunning waterfall. I would tread carefully following rain as the steps could become quite slippery.', 'Loved Athabasca Falls. We were there on Labour day so it was a bit crowded but with patience, you could get a good view and take lots of pictures.There were also lots of washroom facilities available. Would have been a nice spot to stop for a picnic.', 'The falls were not far from Jasper. They were an easy walk to get to as well. Every view of the falls was another photo opportunity', 'Very nice set of waterfalls. A couple short trails to see the upper and lower falls. Interesting lookouts over the falls. plenty of parking', 'As a friend said; touristy but worth it, Large fast flowing falls just near the car park. Just have to hope you manage to avoid the tourist busses.', 'Excellent. There is a nice walking trail, so allow some time for that. Series of bridges, deep gorge, impressive.', \"We pulled off the road on a whim after we saw the waterfall sign. What a find! We stayed over an hour exploring, walking the many trails, and taking tens of great pictures. And, it's free! Wear good shoes for the walking and make a point to know where you are (and where you left your car!) We got disoriented a couple of times with the many winding trails. A truly gorgeous falls and close-up water views are amazing!\", 'The low clouds, light drizzle, sound of the roaring falls all made for a spectacular experience. Not to be missed.', 'These falls although not high are fantastic. The roar caused by the water winding its way through the rocks is incredible. They are on the main route between Banff and Jasper and should not be missed.', 'Impresive. Very impresive. Grat place to hike and many photo opportunities. Great paths between huge rocks. Easy accessible. Well worth to visit. Free car park.', \"What's not to like about gushing water over age old rocks and into deep canyons. Beautiful scenery and well worth a visit.\", 'We stopped as part of a group so time was limited, a definite drawback. An early experience of the Rockies. The power of water over the years opens up a fantastic spectacle which is worthwhile taking a bit of time. Watch your footing.', 'Most impressive to see and hear the power of the water which has sculpted the rock over the eons. Fortunately we were there when there were not too many people. Judging by the large parking lot it could get mighty crowded. Off season on a rainy day was perfect.', 'We enjoyed walking along the edge of the river to the Falls and the Falls overlooks. It is beautiful.', \"Getting to this location is an easy walk - rewarded by a gorgeous falls. Don't miss this turn off on the Ice Fields Parkway.\", 'This waterfall is very accessible, plenty of parking, and always provides excellent photo opportunities.', 'An absolute must do, great experience, you are driven out onto the glacier in Big Cats, and given quite a bit of information by the driver on the way to the glacier', 'Went here to take pictures. You need to try and get there either in the morning or anytime when it is cloudy. The tour buses make the place crowded. Great place for pictures.', \"On our last day in Jasper area we took the drive out to Athabasca Falls. We had seen it before but are always in awe of the power of water in carving out rocks to form a channel. Walk was relatively easy even though it was drizzling a bit that day. Lots of good photo opportunities. We did, though, see some very stupid young males climb over the safety fence and stand out on the rocks. Attention getting? I'm sure they didn't see anything more than we did.\", \"What a wonderful experience, Fred our driver from Sundog Tours took us on an amazing journey to see this natural sight. Would recommend this to everyone visiting the area, it's not to be missed\", 'Pretty as a picture. Very easy access to the falls. Worth going to.............. Nothing more to say', 'loved to hear the rush of water and feel the spray. Lots of tourists. Really there was nothing we disliked as there was lots of parking', 'The falls and the location are fabulous for a walk and sightseeing water and nature at their prime. Easy access and relatively flat walking if only the upper falls are going to be viewed', 'Brilliant waterfall and then some! More and more waterfalls as river continues through ravine to lake beyond. Interesting walk down to lake through path of ancient river canyon. Interesting rock formations, plenty to see and photograph. Easy reach from carpark.', 'Wear your waterproof. Lots of spray and lots of other tourists all doing the same thing. More like a giant plug hole than a waterfall. But worth the stop', 'Truly amazing natural experience that took many thousands of years for nature to carve out of the stone and rock. The walk around offers many photo ops. DO take time to see this one.', 'This is no Niagara but is a beautiful place. Make sure to take the short walk on the right hand side of the road opposite the falls. Stunning scenery and unreal colours', 'Rushing water, great viewpoints, easy walk to get there. It was impressive even on a rainy, cold day. Lots of tourists vying for good camera shots.', 'Although we visited in late summer, there was still enough water to be very impressive. The walk was easy & interesting. A must stop.', 'Beautiful walks and wonderful photo opportunities! As with everything in the Rockies during the height of summer - go early to avoid the crowds and enjoy the peace!', 'Gorgeous scenery, potholes, historic information along a beautifully man made path. Walk along the river to the falls, down to the potholes and through the old river where the rock won! Wonderful, picturesque stop toward Jasper.', 'The falls were simply awesome and amazing! However, the bathrooms were dirty, smelly enough to choke a horse. The hand sanitizer was empty and we were very disappointed especially having to pay a fee to enter Jasper. One would think that the fees would also include regular maintenance of the washrooms.', 'Athabasca Falls are one of those must sees when travelling thru Jasper National Park. It is not far down Highway 93 and worth a stop.', \"Absolutely breathtaking. After paying $25 and being disappointed with the Skywalk we stumbled across the Athabasca Falls. It's beautiful and free!\", \"well worth the stop! It is a amazing and beautiful waterfall and the way it cut through rock is breathtaking. The only thing I can say is for a Thursday afternoon, it was FULL and hard to get around with all the tourists. I figured the middle of September and the middle of the week it wouldn't be quite so crowded. I was wrong...but it was still worth the stop\", 'Outside the town of Jasper but well worth the drive. Great place to go regardless of age. Good walking sidewalks, with rails. Some stairs. Great views.', 'They look small when compared to some other falls. But once you see them you are in awe of them. Very close to the parking lot. The view from each angle is different. One has to go to all the possible view points to watch. Seeing this fall from so close relaxes the mind and gives a pleasant feeling.A worth place to visit.', 'This is a must stop to see. It is just a few steps before you see this gorgeous spot! Walk up and down on both sides so you can see the falls and where they go as the water flows into a beautiful pool and river!', 'Great little falls right off the highway. Nice paths to walk on, and wheelchair accessible. Definitely take the time to walk around the falls. The path takes you right near the edge where the water drops.', 'This is a must stop, falls are beautiful and nice trails well done to walk around, easy to spend an hour here. there is really a lot to see. we were here in Sept and it was flowing really good with blue water, I cant imagine what it is like when the snow is melting in the spring. Make the stop', 'The waterfall is easily accessible and impressive. You must go to both sides of it to enjoy all its beauty', 'This waterfall is worth a short walk. Having seen numerous falls in BC, I liked the layout and pathways provided to explore Athabasca. Wish we went whitewater-rafting though!!', 'You HAVE to stop -- if you are passing -- but there are lots of amazing waterfalls in Canada - things one is easily accessible form the main road', 'The proof of the phenomenal power of water is amazing!\\nThere are a few stairs but could be fun for the whole family! Fantastic views of the falls and mountains!', 'Just like any other falls in the Rocky Mountains, they are beautiful! The scenery is worth seeing and very accessible to everyone as they are a very short walk from the parking area!!', 'The only negative thing was the wet weather we picked in May 2013. But the views and majesty of all those thousands of tony cascading down the falls was breath taking', \"The falls are a very short stroll from the parking lot, which makes them accessible for almost everyone. There are a few stairs, however, that I don't think you can get around. It doesn't take long to stop, and the falls are worth seeing, but be prepared for a crowd.\", \"When you pull into the parking area at Athabasa Falls, it doesn't look like much. Just a shallow, r rippling river... but you can hear the roar of the water, and that draws you along to the walkway and on to the bridge crossing the raging, beautiful falls. There are many paths, signage bearing interesting facts about the area, a tonne of photo opportunities.Don't miss the lower tunnel, where the river once ran. It's labelled the Time Tunnel, and the rock formations are amazing. Continue on around the bend to the right for a stunning view of the now-calm waters of the lower river. If you are only planning to travel as far as Jasper, this is definitely worth the extra drive!Note: We were there at sunset, very few people around, a gorgeous sunset added to the ambiance!\", 'The trail is easy, not much elevation, people of all ages can do it easily. It has some stairs( sometimes slippery), so stroller carriers, think before you carry it. The igneous rocks have been cut by the falls water, and that looks great. It could take 1-2 hours easily if you do the entire loop.', 'we stopped on route from Canmore to Jasper and the falls were well worth a visit. Beautiful scenery and not a difficult walk. although Sept still coach parties around so I am not sure how busy it would be in high season, but still worth visiting', \"Waterfalls and water in general is as hypnotic and tranquil as fire to us crazy human types so no wonder we all love seeing water come crashing thru rock channels and pooling up before dropping again. We walk through these trails and lose track of time as we're hypnotized as we stare at the raw beauty of water...showing rock whose the boss...lolBeautiful, free to all, and kids will love all the climbing and jumping...don't miss it\", 'This is the second time seeing this and it was well worth a repeat visit. The scenery is magnificent', \"It gets very crowded here so be prepared. Pretty little falls. Make sure you walk down to the water and see the canyon. It's a short steep walk, but you get a different perspective.\", \"It is a beautiful sight for all the senses. A don't miss is the short trek through the lower end to a lake and lookout. Beautiful pictures. You could climb up and just take in the beauty of the Canadian Rockies\", 'The Falls are very pretty adn the hike there and back is quite enjoyable. with some bends, curves, and switchbacks along the way.', 'A must see on any trip around Jasper. Like elsewhere within the park, informative signs, well marked trails and routes.', 'Good walking tours follow river and falls with various outlooks for picture taking. Geology and mountain vistas.', 'The canyon the the falls runs into is as inspiring as the falls. The walk to the falls is short and easy.', 'A must for all visitors..... Useful information boards explained what you were seeing and why.....just fantastic!', \"The other reviews are spot on, this is a can't miss spot. There is a very short walk, not hike, on pavement, to the perfect spot. Just do it.\", 'This was a great stop on our first day travelling to Jasper. The falls were beautiful. There is a nice walking area around the falls and down to the river, lots of Photo opps.', 'During the busy Labor Day weekend, this was the only place where we felt claustrophobic (in our days visiting Banff, Jasper, Lake Louise, Icefield Parkway over the days during and around the weekend). People were shoving, rude and it was really hard to enjoy the beautiful waterfall!', 'There are levels of walking for everyone - near or farther. Some rough spots. Such a beautiful spot!', 'We have been here several time before so it has become a regular when showing off to visitors. The falls are stupendous. So much power and nice easy walks.', 'Absolute must see!! Words cannot express the power of these falls. I was very impressed with the great\\nwalks and viewpoints and informational plaques. I have been here many times and am always amazed.', 'This is a definite must see for anyone who is traveling between Jasper and Banff Alberta. The toilets are outhouses and although as clean as an outhouse can be, still smelly. Concrete walkways and bridges make for easy access for able-bodied people. Unfortunately there are steps that would prevent wheelchairs accessing the beautiful views. Set aside at least 45 minutes to an hour just for a quick look around. On the occasion of our visit there was a Parks Canada staff member with information setup about various animals, and she was showing animal pelts [I am sure these animals were not killed by Parks Canada staff solely for demonstration purposes]. I have never had the opportunity before to see the size and feel the fur of these various animals. It was a very positive experience. There is no gift shop or any other trappings. I believe Parks Canada has tried to keep this beautiful spot as pristine as possible given the large number of tourists that come by every year.', \"You must stop here, you won't regret it. Amazing little place with a huge wow factor!! The power of these falls is awesome. Can get a little crowded so I would get there in the morning.\", 'worth the stop, river flowing into falls and canyon below. Nice tourist area right off main highway to view fall, with outdoor facilities', 'Sheets of spray billow off the milky white water plunging over the falls into the narrow gorge. There are several points on the paved path to get great views and pictures. All this just a short walk from the car park.', \"Excellent well worth a visit, get there early as parking can be quite limited and it is very busy at times, the falls are spectacular so don't forget the camera.\", \"Try the Rafting Adventures - it's great fun and good for all the family, from 6 years old. Safe but exciting!\", 'The falls are situated in approximately 30 kilometers of Jasper. The site is charming, the debit of water is impressive. The arrangement is easily accessible and walks very well in a fitted out path. To see absolutely. There is however a lot of people.', 'At first sight they looked disappointing, but further in the falls were absolutely breathtaking. Not just the falls, but the carved out rock they have created over the years\",', 'Athabasca Fall is right by the highway. From the parking lot we did not need to walk much to reach the fall. It was nice walking around the fall and canyon.', \"This is great, give yourself some time to really walk around, it's well worth 45 minutes, there's not just the falls, but the canyons, pot holes and the serene lake\", 'Beautiful location but extremely crowded if you get caught up with the organised travel groups. Make sure you get their early or later in the day when the tour buses have moved on.', 'One of the many sights along the Icefields Parkway and worth the stop. Nicely presented and maintained by the Parks authority.', \"Athabasca Falls, by far, is one of my favorite spots in Jasper National Park. The beauty just surrounds you from all sides. It's a must see for sure!\", \"The falls were absolutely breathtakingly powerful ....you can also take a walk along the river ......going down through the rocks there isn't that much to see - so avoid if you have issues with mobility - but Definately take a walk over the bridge to experience the power of the falls - feels like it's raining\", 'Awesomeness. Great for a stop to stretch the legs. Very pleased and very scenic. Great photo opportunity. A few trails around to explore. Toilets. Picnic areas.', 'What can you say about something like this, it amazes me every time I go there, following the trail gets you to more views and more falls!! it is nice and it is close to Jasper.', 'Even in winter, with frozen water, this fall is a sight to see. Great photo op and paved track so can be accessed even in winter.', 'nice break to take a walk and a few pictures. Amazing how much water has passed over the rocks and carved out its path.', \"A great sight, even if you've seen a waterfall before, this one has it's own unique features. The best part is probably the small hike down to the river bottom where the falls calm, so tranquil and beautiful. There tend to be a ton of people at the falls, it's nice to take a few steps away and get away from the crowd down below.\", 'I didnt expect to see such a big water fall in Alberta! Definitely must see for any nature lovers. When we were there it was pretty gloomy and raining but we still had a good time', \"It was quite crowded when we arrived and had to wait for a few people to move before we could get pictures without strangers in them . The falls are pretty but make sure you cross the pedestrian bridge and follow the trail to the right , under the road's bridge . You walk thru a small abandoned canyon and there is a fork in the trail . To the left leads down to the river's edge . To the right takes you to a beautiful overlook of the river leveling out and a beautiful rock escarpment . Nature has really worked it's magic here with the beautiful contrast of colors between the rock and the silty river .  Everyone has their own interests but I literally would stop here again just for this view .\", 'I loved this gem! Amazing scenery that can take your breath away. I will be coming back every year! A must-see. Great, light walking for someone like me with a double knee injury; the paths are easy to walk and perfect for families.', 'Wonderful to look at and enjoy, there are various viewing points you can walk to. Really enjoyed this place.', 'you have to walk on stairs but it is worth it.\\nMake sure to reach the other side of the falls.\\nYou will get wet but the view is well worth it.\\nDo go down to the lower canyon.', \"I've been here many times and in many different seasons but am always delighted by these beautiful falls. Usually quite crowded in summer time but worth the stop; can easily spend 30 minutes here crossing the falls and going down the path to the base of the falls.\", 'Nice waterfalls, but a waterfall is just a waterfall.Stop, look, take a picture and move on to the better stuff!', 'Although less popular than Sunwapta Falls, Athabasca Falls was quite beautiful to see. Wider than some other falls, it is a nice stop while driving to Jasper or Banff.', 'The place is spectacular, with a fantastic view over gorges and fall. We hear very well the current of the river to bounce on cliffs. Is worth seeing. There is however a great deal of tourists, often incapable to wait and which put themselves in your way at any time to be photographed.', 'A waterfall viewed from the top. Only a short, easy walk from the car park. An unusual view and one not to miss.', 'Wow the water flows thru here fast, you must make a stop to check this out. The amount of water travelling thru the rocks with such force was incredible to watch and a great walk thru the rocks down to see where it all ends up in the lake. You only need a half hour stop to check it out and it is worth it.', 'Only a short walk from the car the falls are spectacular. Although popular they have real atmosphere and well worth doing the trackes around and about to make the most of them.', 'The falls were fantastic to view, the history and beauty are something to really take in. Walking along the falls is a really great experience and good exercise as you climb the stairs', 'Easy walking trails lead to serveral vantage points of these spectacular falls. Stand on the trails below the falls and feel the cool mist, great on a hot day (be sure to cover your lens)', \"The sounds alone will astonish you! Water currents and geological erosion come to a head here when you stand before the awesome energy of Athabasca Falls. Though the cascade is not as vertically pleasing as most falls, the power and flow-width of this direction change and drop in elevation of the river makes you aware of it's displayed, ever present energy. Stopping to hear and feel the mist on your cheeks is worth every minute.\", \"If you are in the Jasper area, be sure to take the time to go to the Athabasca Falls. It is a beautiful natural area where you could spend much time just soaking in nature's bounty.\", 'I liked the informative notices that Parks Canada has posted there, explaining how the falls are receding up the river over time. It is a great spot for photos, as we say a rainbow over the falls.', 'The park service did an excellent job with the many interesting viewpoints of these beautiful falls. Very much worth the stop.', 'Certainly worth the stop, but it was very busy when we were there.. I think there were 3 busses in the parking lot. I picked up a bag of garbage that someone had just dropped in the middle of the path and put in the garbage bin only 50ft away... how can some people be so ignorant?', 'Athabasca Falls has to be seen. Impressive. Visit both sides. Take your time. Maybe the right side is more impressive, you could reach the border of the falls', 'Was a lovely spot to view the force of the river and falls. Great nature lover pictures. A short distance from the highway and well worth the stop to see the canyons and falls in the river.', 'This is more than a waterfall. Take the time to walk all the way down and around to the bottom Look at the walls, potholes, the little alpine gardens, and of course the rushing water below you. This is a waterfall to be appreciated up close, and slow enough to appreciate some of the finer points. There are plenty of informational boards to help explain this unique place.', 'We hit up the Athabasca falls after decided to drive through the parks on our way from Golden to Edmonton - glad we did. The falls themselves were just breathtaking but I was also impressed by the trails around the falls - nice to be able to walk down the old path of the falls etc.', \"Another spectacular natural wonder in these great parks. Quite the falls and rock formations. Don' t drive by - stop and see these falls. As always if you want to see them without the crowds come very early in the day and you won't have to elbow anyone out of your photo spot.\", 'Best falls in Jasper, hands down. Spectacular and so powerful! Well worth the stop and short walk to get right next to the falls. DO NOT MISS THIS!', 'This is a must if you are travelling from Jasper to Banff. It is a quick jaunt off of the highway and is just beautiful! Definately worth stopping for a bit and enjoying the sights!', 'This is a beautiful stop on the drive from Banff to Jasper and even better because it is free. Nice bridges and walking paths with very safe railings allow you to see the falls from many angles. This falls is fairly high, but more of an attraction because of the volume of water going over. Easy walk for those with limited mobility to see parts of it - a few stairs to get to other viewpoints.', \"It's a spectacular waterfall. There are several spots from which to admire its beauty. Easy access. Don't miss it.\", 'Stopped here on the way to Banff. The Falls are amazing. So much water. When we were there, there was a stunning rainbow above the Falls. It woudl be a crime to be in the area and not stop here IMO.', 'As all of the other reviews have stated, these falls are exceptional! You can spend a long time just looking at them in awe! Definitely worth a visit.', 'It is amazing that the rocks survive the constant pounding of the water. Really worth seeing. Easy trail and steps to see the falls top to bottom', 'I could have spent hours at these falls. Very easy access right off the Icefields Parkway. Guiding paths allowed viewing from all angles. Definitely a place to visit.', 'Make sure you stop and see this, so beautiful. Lots of tourists but its normal as its so beautiful. I stop here when ever I am in that area.', 'The Canadians love their parks and can be legitimately proud of Athabasca Falls. It is easly accessible and because of bridges, you can see the falls from many vantage points. This is a \"don\\'t miss\" if you are in the vicinity of Jasper', 'From a gentle surface to the canyon formed by the falls shows the power of nature. Short treks can also take you up and downstream a bit for further views', 'The falls were amazing. The color of the water is beautiful. We just stayed and watched the great gushing of water and enjoyed it so much. A relaxing break from a hectic trip!', '...you could elude the ever-present overcrowding. Face it, anyone who visits Banff/Jasper/Yoho/Kootenay all visit nearly the same time of year. The crowds in the well-known areas are going to be overwhelming. I still have to say, though, it most definitely interferes with your ability to absorb what otherwise on an uncrowded day would be a lifetime experience.That being said, the falls are beautiful. Parks Canada has carved out a beautiful path to view and to descend to the beach, where you are able to depart on a white water rafting expedition. The falls would be an incredible experience if you could enjoy them in a less-crowded setting. My suggestion would be to try to get here very early and see if the experience is different.Parks Canada has also done a great job with the placement of informative markers so you can read the historic elements of the falls. I simply wish I enjoyed viewing things with 1000 of my best friends.', 'Good for a quick stop. 15 minute viewing of falls so close to the road. Big parking lot. Buses will be there about 8.30 so leave Jasper before 8 to be ahead of the crowds', 'We & our kids enjoyed being able to see & feel the falls as well as explore around the area. It was beautiful. FYI though, this is not stroller or wheel chair friendly.', \"Not just another falls, very impressive to see and hike around. Wish we had more time to do the trail down to lower view. Saddest part was seeing memorials to young people who didn't stay on trail, and were lost down the falls. Watch the kiddos! And hope you don't mind using park pit toilets\", 'The power and force of water is visually displayed at these beautiful water falls. The water carves through the canyon. It gives one pause and demonstrates power.', \"http://www.jasper.travel/content/athabasca-fallsDon't pass this by. It doesn't look like much from the road, but has several vantage points for spectacular views of the waterfall and the interesting erosion patterns. I found it to be one of the best waterfalls I have seen due to the surrounding scenery and erosion than for the falls.There are boardwalks, decks, concrete and stone steps, and paved rams on which to walk to view the falls from different vantage points. Be sure to walk around the corner at the old falls to get the full effect. There are a lot of steps, perhaps 100 altogether, so be prepared to be tired if you are not accustomed to steps/stairs and altitude. You cannot negotiate strollers except at the very beginning. Some of the steps and walkways are wet, so I would recommend good walking shoes with rubber soles rather than heels or flip-flops.My bus tour was only there for 30 minutes, so I had to hurry to go to the end and back in that time. If you are on your own with no time constraints, I would allow about an hour here. It is quite crowded, but the photo ops are splendid.\", 'The falls are beautiful and very easily accessed. The walkways allow visitors to experience the falls (and their power) from several different vantage points. Very cool.', \"By all means, this is worth the time to pull over and explore. We walked the entire boardwalk and were blown away by the volume of water and forces created. The mist in the air made for fantastic photographs. Highly recommend it. You won't be disappointed.\", \"These falls are close to the highway and so are worth a stop off during your drive up or down the Icefield Parkway. We spent 35 minutes here, walking to see the falls from the different angles possible, and taking pictures but you could have easily spent longer as we were very quick. Whilst we saw many different falls on our trip, I would definitely recommend stopping here. As others have said, here you see the awesome power of God and his creation. It's just amazing to stand and watch the power of the water. Truly amazing - a wide, calm river and the power it has on the rock as it falls. It's interesting to walk down the passageway to see the canyon and river below. Where you walk, is what once was a passageway for the water, a long time ago and you can see where the water has carved patterns in the rock over time.\", 'Just a short hike from the parking lot takes you to a thundering waterfall (more like a really big dangerous rapid) and a deep cut gorge. Just off the Icefields Parkway south of Jasper.', 'The falls are easy to access, which accounts for its suffocating crowds. I guess I would rather hike to a less crowded waterfall. Otherwise, it is one amazing, majestic sight as the river cascades lower.', 'This is a must see stop. Its not a long walk at all and well worth it if it was. It shows the awesome power of God and his creation.', \"Athabasca falls is certainly a MUST while visiting Jasper National Park.the main falls are close to the road, but if you wish to enjoy the full experience, take the short well-maintained trail to the bottom of the little canyon, where the falls open up into the river.The sheer power of the water thundering down the falls is very impressive.The water-carved walls in the little canyon created by the falls are beautiful to walk through.A great experience for the whole family.We loved it!! So will you!!!Don't Miss It!!\", 'A very short walk from the car park to a stunning set of waterfalls and a great example of the forces of nature at work as cuts through a deep canyon to the floor below', 'This is probably one of the most impressive, definitely in terms of its water force. Just a short walk, and you get to look at it from different angles. You even get to feel it as it sprays over the viewers platform. Wonderful.', 'This was a beautiful stop. Short and very easy. Handicap accessible for a good portion of it. The part that is not handicap accessible is a very easy path to hike. The falls here are lovely, great picture spot! Many visitors stop here, it can be very crowded.', 'Athabasca Falls is one of the must do stops in the Jasper area. It is a nice walk with lots of water. We say so many falls in Alberta and this was one of the good ones and worth a stop.', 'The sheer power & force of the water flowing as it wends its way down from the top of the falls is an incredible sight! The vegetation & rock wall formations that harness the sideways flow having been worn away by the water have a strength of their own ! A must see when in the area.', 'What a great walk to see what water can etch into a landscape. The path is easy and safe, the photo ops are brilliant. Well worth a peek.', 'Amazing falls but I guess it has to be enjoyed by all. And I mean all! If you are lucky enough to visit between tour busses! The best time is probably early evening and when the weather is a little cool. Yes a must to see in Jasper!', 'This is some kind of a fall, big, noisy and showing itself from all sides, with even a sport to refresh yourselve in the spray. Very interesting also because you can walk an old arm where the water left and see what it did to the rock. It ends down where the falls end up in the river, quite a nice spot.', 'COOL AND REFRESHING with the spray in your face and so beautiful for photography. My fave place in Jasper definitely', 'Enjoyed thoroughly the sound of the fall, cool air and majestic falling for water. Makes me wonder why man thinks they can be God? The fall was so magnificent.', 'We stopped off when driving down the Icefields parkway. It was a good stop with some great views and with not much walking involved a good way to break up the journy', 'The falls are quite lovely and interesting. Be sure to walk around so you can view the falls and associated canyon from different directions. Excellent photo opportunities. Not a place to scramble around but very much worth seeing. Look for cross bedding in the sandstone all around and amongst the falls.', 'We took the 1st road to the falls which is actually the longest road to the falls, but the scenery is worth it and there is virtually no other cars!! We were able to stop and get lots of pictures without worrying about who was behind us. Lots of elk grazing by the road. The falls are absolutely beautiful.....do not miss them!!', 'Lots of good views of Athabasca Falls, but stay on marked trails. It is dangerous to leave them. Many different angles to view these beautiful waterfalls.', 'Never expected this sight and the power of river water sediment carving bowls and canyons thru solid rock.', 'Absolutley breathtaking beauty!! The Falls were magnificent and powerful. I loved my time there and would advice anyone going to Jasper to take the short trip to the Athabasca Falls.', 'The falls were frozen when we visited them. The lake was free from ice. It was very beautiful. You should see this at least two times. Frozen and when the water crushes down. You have a lot of platforms around the falls for the best view.', 'Nature is amazing! A short easy walk which is well worth it. Note the beautiful rock formations as well as the falls.', 'Worth a visit, wear suitable shoes and go hiking around the park. Falls are great and rush through the blow hole. Plwnty of great shots for photos.', \"Maximum view with very little hiking effort! We took many great photos, which didn't even begin to capture how spectacular it was.\", 'Athabasca Falls is not the most stunning sight, you will experience along the Parkway, but it is certainly worth the easy in and out visit. A very powerful falls, there is a series of walkways and bridges that allow you great vantage to see the falls, the pools and the power of mother nature. You can ease right off the road, there is ample parking to a short walk. Do it!', 'Really impressive falls,quite mesmerising to watch! Plenty of information to read and lots of different view points.', 'Very popular and thus relatively crowded. Easy walk from parking lot. Allow 30 mins to take in the views. Nice and cool on a warm day due to breezes from cold water. Plan clothing accordingly - particularly if it is chilly out.', \"Very powerful falls, and well worth a stop if you're travelling along the Icefield Parkway. Good interpretation along the route.\", 'Another great stop on the icefields parkway. Easy to get to with paved walking trails to all the good viewing spots. Amazing views of the impressive falls from all around. Take some insect repellant though!', 'Awesome falls, small walk and a nice stop point along the way. Kids loved the spray coming off and it is quite amazing to see. worth stopping', 'Family of 4 and our dog visited late July. It was busy but no problems getting a parking spot. Beautiful falls. Great paths to walk and lots to see. There is more than just the falls. Be sure to go down to the river and sit for a while. My boys loved building Inukshuks down by the river.', 'Our kids loved this stop along the Ice Fields parkway. The falls are pretty spectacular and there are many nice walking paths around the area to view the falls from different locations.', \"Go early or late in the day to avoid the crowds else you won't really get to appreciate the natural beauty of the place\", 'This is an essential stop. A marvel of nature and easy to access. We were impressed by the interpretive panels that educate the visitor about the river and the falls.', 'We have been visiting Athabasca Falls for the last 35 years whenever we come to Jasper National Park and it never fails to impress. The way the walkways and lookouts are positioned around the falls give great views of the sides and front of the falls. There are also many informational posts regarding the natural history of the falls and area.The Athabasca Falls are easy to access from either the Icefields Parkway or Hwy 93A. There is lots of parking available within easy walking distance of the falls and there are bathrooms at the site.', 'We were here in the peak of summer and this was one of the most impressive feats of nature I have seen!

Very close to the carpark so not a long walk at all.', 'This is an excellent stop for anyone in the Jasper area. Gorgeous waterfall which can be seen from many angles.', 'Quick accessible stop just short of Jasper if you are on the Icefields Parkway. We were happy to stretch our legs and were thrilled with the huge volume of water that passes through the Athabasca Falls every day. It is an easy path most of the way but be prepared to encounter lots of tourists.', 'One of the most beautiful waterfalls in the world. A must see and very accessible.

These were absolutely beautiful! Well worth the time! Be sure to view them from above and below.\", 'This is a one of the must-see falls.

Nevertheless, with a bit of waiting around we took the photos we wanted but gave up on some aspects as we planned to visit again en route to Lake Louise.

I recommend staying on the established trails as some of the area is fairly steep. Lots of photo ops!', 'We stopped on to way to Banff. It was really worth the stop. The car park is big enough and there are washrooms. It was very impressive. We really enjoyed the view. It was a rainy day so the flow was even more impressive.

Be sure to take your camera with you and go right to the bottom to get the full experience.', 'Quite nice, as always it is walking to the falls themselves that adds to the overall experience.Also by going to these areas it gives you the chance of seeing animals.

A great way to spend a few hours.', 'Every stop is picture postcard around this area & the Athabasca Falls are no exception - breathtakingly beautiful !', 'these falls are amazing so much water coming through such a small space. lots of opportunities to view the falls close up', \"We had looked at the Bow River Falls in Banff proper and while they're famous for their appearence in the 1953 Marilyn Monroe film River of No Return, they're not exactly spectacular. I almost didn't care if we skipped these... wow, would that have been a mistake. The falls themselves start off with a steep plunge into a set of pools, so the sound of crashing water is impressive. There is a path around the falls and it is well worth it to walk to the other side as on sunny days there are beautiful rainbows (I'll post a picture of them) to view. They have moved the fences very close to the falls so you get very good views of the falls. The water swirls at the bottom so there are these cool circular pools carved into the rock. There are also several paths that lead down closer to the lower parts of the falls and bridges that allow for great photos. VERY impressive stop. One note.... numerous people were seen climbing the fences to get pictures closer to the edge of the falls and this behavior scared the pants off many. I was told several people a year go over the edge. I believe this is because the signs are only in English and French, and believe new signs should be placed in Japanese and Chinese warning to to scale the fence. You don't need these at ever site but this site has the potential for great danger. Just a thought.\", \"We stopped on our way back to Jasper from Maligne Lake. It was gorgeous! It's always nice to be able to cool off during the day when it gets hot and this is an excellent spot to do it! There is a trail you can take to the bottom of the falls and dip your feet on the water. There's also a spot you can stand and enjoy the mist :)Tips:- comfortable shoes! - take your camera and water- give your self an hour, at least. - please don't litter and stick to the trails.\", 'Not far off the Icefields Parkway, more touristy but worth seeing. The hiking areas were mostly wooden walkways, easy walking.', 'The falls in the Canadian Rockies are known less for their size and drop as for the sheer power of the water rushing through narrow parts of the rivers. Athabasca is one of the best and just outside Jasper.', 'We visited in early July when the falls were full and the water was rushing over the rocks. What a magnificent place! I could have stayed for hours!', 'An easy drive and lots of wildlife in the area. The falls themselves are amazing and the river itself is beautiful. The trail is very easy and has some incredible viewpoints. You can even feel the spray from the falls.', 'You must stop and see these falls. Unbelievable how fast the water is gushing through these very narrow and deep gorges. There is a walking track around the falls so you get a good view from different angles. It is just off the Icelands parkway.', 'After the Athabaskan Glacier and The Skywalk, this was breathtaking as well. What a beautiful fall. Worthwhile to visit.', 'Right off the Icefields Parkway and definitely worth the stop. The river drops through a short but deep gorge; paths and stairs let you see the whole thing from various vantage points. Enjoy the spray on a hot day!', 'We could hear the roar of the water as we opened the car door. The paths to the falls are very well done. The falls are stunning. Make sure you have your camera. Would recommend.', 'This is a must see if driving the Icefields Parkway. The falls are only a short stroll from the parking area and the trails offer great vantage points.', \"It's a little bit outside Jasper, so it's easy to miss it, but it's worth the stop :it's quite close to the road, so very accessible !The power of those Falls is quite impressive...It might be a little bit in the shadows early in the morning so not so easy to take good pictures,I think around noun the sunlight might be better...\", \"I could't find the beauty of the famous Athabasca falls.. maybe wasn't a good day to visit it... but the water was extremely brown\", \"You can hear the roar of these falls from far away; once you're near, you'll be impressed by the sheer volume of water. Spend some time wandering and taking pictures\", \"Bring your camera. You'll want to take plenty of nature photographs here. I myself took 488 shots. It was glorious.\", 'Huge falls that you can easily spend hours enjoying and photographing. Make sure you go down to the abandon part of the falls.', 'Great place to go , kids loved it especially where you could get sprayed with water!!\\nEasily accessible\\nToilets were very smelly would not recommend to use them', 'Great attraction near the Icefield parkway lends itself to lots of tourists so it can get a bit crowded. I suspect anyone nearby stops with good reason. One of the many must see places in the Canadian Rockies.', \"Departing Jasper you will see Athabasca Falls on the way back down towards Banff. I did notice a bridge and a lot of mist while heading north but did not stop. On the way back down South I pulled off the freeway and it is a very short drive to the parking lot and an even shorter walk to view the falls. Definitely worth the stop to check out the falls. Beautiful (is there any waterfall that isn't??). One of the must see if you are visiting Banff and Jasper National Parks.\", 'We stopped here on the way from Banff to Jasper, this is one of the myst see locations near Jasper. Easily accessible from the car park so its a great location for families to visit. A short easy walk brings you straight to the falls. We walked across the bridge and had a different view of the falls. The spray and mist was quite something, almost like having a spray shower which the kids loved! Another short walk downstream brings you to the canyon view. The walk is interesting as it brings you down a flight of stairs that seemed to be carved out of huge rocks!', 'Fantastic views, all around. Millions of years powerful currents carving stunning sculptures.\\nIf you are a smoker or enjoy littering, please have some respect for the nature & drive right past this spot.', 'Awesome -amongst most spectacular natural phenomenon I have ever seen. Access and presentation excellent.', 'A must see when visiting Jasper, great views of the falls from many different angles and vatage points', \"Good car parking. If you can walk 200 yds and do 56 well maintained 30 degree steps down then up again then you can see the lot from all angles. Still worth seeing even without doing the steps.We did this as the first of a three stop day out of Jasper. Next was Sunaptra Falls then a trip down to 'glacier central'. On our trip we saw black bears (with cubs) at the roadside and mountain goats and of course amazing scenery.A good stop but perhaps a bit of a geography field trip stop rather than a 'wow' so don't base your whole day on it.\", 'We were told to see Athabasca Falls as a preference to Sunwapta Falls if time was limited. We did Sunwapta on the way to Jasper then Athabasca on the way back to Lake Louise. Athabasca Falls is very impressive and is very close to the highway, much more impressive than Sunwapta.', 'Well worth the turn off the highway. Amount of water and the noise is amazing. Short walk from car park so no problem seeing this great sight.', 'It is a very impressive area and not far off the highway so be sure to take the time to visit. How did the fish get above those falls???', 'The sheer power and volume of these falls is not to be missed. A good location to see a beautiful without the long walks required of other locations in this area.', \"What surprised me was that the water was very brown. The walking path was nice enough, but I didn't find it too exciting.\", \"They may not match up to Niagra, but the Athabasca Falls certainly show just what water can do! These thunderings falls are carving a real chasm through the rocks and although they are not going to occupy you for hours it is a great free show with interesting information scattered around the many viewing areas. Definitely worth a visit if you are in jasper and especially if, like it was when we were there, the weather wasn't good enough to be heading up the mountains!\", \"If you don't like waterfalls than it probably is not for you but the walk is what I would class as an easy hike take a camera and a bottle of water and your set a great free attraction to do\", \"A must see for anyone visiting the Jasper area of the Rockies. The falls are magnificent, especially with the mountains in the background and there are several very good viewing areas from which to take photos.When we were returning to our coach, we spotted a black bear grazing in the wooded area adjacent to one of the pathways. It was calmly minding its own business so we did the same but got back to the coach faster than I think we would have done if we hadn't noticed the bear.\", \"Athabasca Falls enjoys a super tourist friendly approach (i.e. fast and paved) just off of the Icefields Parkway. Its a worthwhile stop, but expect loads of tourists and noise. The falls themselves are nice, although nothing too amazing if you've seen waterfalls and river canyons before.\", 'Athabasca Falls is a waterfall in Jasper National Park, situated next to the road. It is not known for its height, but for its force due to the large quantity of water falling into the gorge. It can be safely viewed and photographed from various viewing platforms and walking trails around the falls. I managed to capture the brillance of rainbow hued sprays at one part of the falls. From the start of the Upper Athabasca river, the water is calm. At the start of the falls, is also calm. Then the water gains momentum, and one can see the sheer force of the waters, rushing vigorously , powerfully down into the gorge. Then after the great fall, one sees calmness again', 'Plenty of good viewing places and relevant information boards. Visiting in May we got to see ice and a good flow of water. The pathways are pretty good, watch your footing where tree roots have caused them to become uneven.', \"these falls are right by the road, so anyone passing by has no excuse for not stopping. Really good views of the falls from many viewing areas, and plenty of great photo opportunities.I've knocked a star off because the toilets were absolutely disgusting. The smell almost made me sick.All in all, a must-see waterfall but avoid the conveniences.\", \"Visited this area in April. The waterfall and ice formations were beautiful and fascinating. It wasn't completely frozen, so some water was flowing down the waterfall. Beautiful views of the blue-green water on the other side of a bridge.\", 'Beautiful waterfall with good access longer walks possible easy to find with good parking great place to view wildlife.', 'Lovely waterfall on the glacial river. Liked the Good info as you walked down to it. Nothing to dislike', 'I was blown away by the Partnachklamm near Garnisch, The Athabasca Gorge is the nearest thing on this continent to reflect the shear power of water.', 'While we were in Jasper we did a drive out to the falls. They are just a short walk from the parking lot and certainly worth seeing. You can hear the power of the water as you get closer. There are lots of information boards around and whilst at the main falls there are a few different viewing areas so make your way around. There is another trail which heads down the canyon for more views. I was reluctant to try it as there were warning signs about the number of steps involved on the return trip.Ended up doing it. Going down was fine and there were a LOT of steps but the lower canyon was also a great spot and the climb back, whilst tiring was manageable. You can take your time and have a rest along the way if need be.', 'Good parking facilities and a very easy and nice walk to a majestic view. Walk around as much as you feel like and spend as much time as you can afford. We stop by each time we drive to Jasper and are equally impressed each time, as the falls and the surrounding area are in continuous change.', 'The Falls are very easily accessible from the parking lot. They are well worth the short walk. Just over the top beautiful and amazing. Exceptional photos opportunities. Canada is packed full of majesty and beauty, Athabasca Falls is among the many fantastic sites to see. If you have mobility problems, do not skip this place very easy to maneuver.', 'We took the shorter walk around the falls but it is beautiful and worth it. With time the longer walk would be nice too.', 'The water has eroded the softer layers of rock here leaving harder layers behind, eventually cutting right down, making a narrow cut through which the water thunders down. The footpaths offer superb view-points from which to admire, photograph or simply stand and enjoy the wonder of this place. There are, like most attractions in Canada, comprehensive informative information boards to educate visitors.Do locate and visit the falls known as Natural Bridge in Yoho National Park. It is very different, stunning, not suitable for disabled or the faint hearted, if you have a little courage you can hop, skip and jump across this natural phenomena and take some brilliant photos or even videos. It will not disappoint those who love nature.', 'The Falls are just a short walk from the parking lot. Another trail heads down the canyon for more views, but warns the visitor that there are a lot of stairs one will need to walk up on the return. But, the hike down the Lower Canyon is not necessary to enjoy the power and magnificence of these Falls. The main Falls are an easy hike and appear handicap accessible. A definite stop/hike to make.', \"You start at the top of this extremely powerful and breathtaking waterfall and venture your way down to where the waterfall calmly streams into a wide river surrounded by mountains. You'll get some beautiful pictures, just don't drop your phone.\", \"An easy five-minute walk from the parking lot and you're there. Very impressive falls with lots of information on the boards about how the falls were formed. Not to be missed.\", 'A short pleasant walk from the car park to see these falls.\\nNot high but a river squeezed into a canyon, the access is good but hang on to your kids!\\nThe power of the water going through the rocks is awesome!', 'Easy access from the parking area. Very little walking required. Lots of viewing areas and photo ops. Definitely worth the stop.', 'There is waterfall, and river to admire. The Park rangers also showed off a bear hides. Not much facilities though.', \"This is quite close to the road and very much worth the stop. It's neither a long nor strenuous hike to see a lovely waterfall cutting uniquely through the rock formations.\", 'We stopped in on the way to the Icefields and are so glad we did not miss this. Great pathways. Get there early.', \"You shouldn't go to Jasper or Lake Louise without stopping along the way to see this gorgeous waterfall and short walk to many vantage points. Very beautiful.\", \"Another of natures many wonders in this part of the world. I would suggest that if you're travelling to Banff, you see the falls on your way there. Only a short walk from the car park and you at the powerfull falls. There isn't a huge amount to do here, however I could stare at waterfalls all day so for me, loved it! It's also free!\", \"You have to be impressed with the power of water. Gallons and gallons roaring over the falls carving stone with consistent force and beauty. I have never been to Niagara Falls but I imagine that this is a slice of what it is like. We were on a tour and couldn't stay as long as we wanted. If I was fortunate enough to come back I would stay much longer and enjoy the trails and follow the roar of the water further. If you can go do so.\", 'Very good place for family outing. Fall views are well protected to have good view of the fall. Do follow the safety rules as water is fast and furious.', 'Great scenery and water falls well worth a visit if you have time however the cafe prior to this is not worth the stop for coffee.', 'Because it was snowing, this was a winter wonderland! Quite intriguing how the water rushes through. Good signage explaining what is happening!', \"Although I was originally a little shocked that they'd compare these falls to Niagara, or even the splendor of The Great Wall of China and the Pyramids of Egypt (they actually do on the signs!), the Athabasca Falls were still a treat.Beyond the main falls, there is a number of short walks available which are also worth taking and it was disappointing (but great for us) that not many of the tourists bothered to make the detour. Situated between Jasper and the Columbian Icefields, I definitely recommend making a stop here at Athabasca Falls.\", 'We were advised by our hosts in Jasper to be sure to do this falls and they were right. Awesome falls in the spring of the year as the snow is melting. Who doesn\\'t love a roaring falls?? Be sure to put this on your \"To Do\" list.', 'We only were able to spend a short time at these falls which were stunning. It was not very busy so we had good views. We walked from the car park, short distance, and easy paths, but can be a bit skippy in places on the concrete. Plenty of places to take some good pictures.', 'Beautiful! Took about 45 minutes to walk around the various paths. Many photo ops. Loved it! Beware: many steps.', 'The walk here is another beautiful sight to see. Along the road, we saw a lot of wildlife. We only stayed a short while as the trail was quite busy.', 'Fantastic what nature can do. This was a lovely day out for us. Thoroughly enjoyed the amazing falls.', \"Unexpectedly beautiful. From the parking lot, my husband said 'there are no waterfalls here'...only to turn a corner and see absolute beauty!\", \"There is a walkway around the falls that lets you get right up close to them. We were lucky enough to be there when it wasn't busy but I can imagine that it can get quite full in season. Really impressive!\", 'The falls are quite stunning and the rock formations which they created over millions of years are now very accessible via an improved hiking trail and new bridges. Naturally carved \"stairways\" are a beautiful sight. There are new rest room facilities as well. You cannot get the full experience and views from the highway or your car.', 'We were only there for a short time during a trip,but it is well worth a stop. The area is lovely and the falls are powerful and you can get some great snaps', \"Nice short hike. Beautiful. We actually photographer here at night since it's a short little walk on a paved path from the parking lot.\", 'Easy to walk around. Amazing views. Its free. Easy to find. Ample parking. Worth a visit. Preferred it to Sunwapta Falls - more to see and read.', 'The waterfalls is OK. We spent about one hour to walk around and take pictures. It is easy to access the falls.', 'While on our Canadian Rockies tour we were taken to Athabasca Falls by our tour guide. He said there are other waterfalls in the area but this was the nicest. We were not dissapointed. The falls are a short paved walk from the parking area easily accessable to those with handicaps. And the view of the falls is well worth the short stop. There are walking trails to the side of the falls to get a different view which I would not recommend for those with handicaps. There is also a stepped walkway to the bottom of the falls. Take a few minutes and enjoy this natural beauty.', \"Stopped on our way to Banff. We'll worth the time and the walk, although as short as you want. We never went the whole way as bridge 5 was closed, still early season and the bears were just starting to appear. In a way some of the features were like Maligne Canyon but very different in other ways. Another must see in Canada.\", 'Well worth a 30 minute stop on your way down the Icefields Parkway. Close to the carpark, and an impressive amount of water coming over.', 'The falls were full and powerful. This is our third visit and we are still in awe of these falls.There is an interesting trail that follows one of the river used to flow and you can walk right up to the end where the river opens up.It was really good to go there in June as the melted snow makes for a very full waterfall.', 'Easy access to a wonderful series of falls. We were there in the height of the melt water coming down from the surrounding area so not sure how impressive they would be later in the year. Maybe something to bear in mind', \"This is the most convenient of the canyons/falls in Jasper and Banff and it is very impressive. A very short walk (couple 100 yrds if that) and then you can go further if you want. All paved. Because of its convenience expect crowds and tour buses. Crowds aren't our thing but we're glad we stopped by for 15-20min.\", 'We saw woodlands orchids in bloom on the path to the falls. This is not an easy place for elders or handicapped individuals, but otherwise- just awesome. The view left little to be desired if you like waterfalls.', 'Beautiful location - the mountains in the background are only beaten by the stunning falls themselves. A must see.', 'We stopped off at the falls as we drove the Icefields Parkway and were very pleased that we did. The fals themselves were very easy to get to from the car park and were in ful flow - the sound was wonderful and the view even better.', 'This is one of the more popular waterfalls along the parkway (as seen by the number of tour buses that stop here). Lots of paths make it easy to see the falls with several viewpoints, each with great views. This is probably the most impressive waterfall on the entire drive between Jasper and Banff, well worth stopping by while driving the Icefields Parkway.', 'Amazing!!! Easy to access and visit on the way thought the Icefields Parkway and to walk around. Only takes a short topi me to see it all but worth the stop', 'easy access from car park. beautiful falls. The thaw had just started so lots of snow and lots and lots of water. Well worth a visit.', 'There was a lot of water because the snow started melting. Impressive noise and sight on the water thats smashed down. Following the stairs you see the rockets with the different colours after ages pressure of the water.', 'thundering sound of the water crashing over the rocks was great!\\nfascinating how the water has sculpted the landscape', 'This is a short easy walk near the Icefields Parkway. As you walk along the paved path you discover more and more sights of water.', \"The Falls have an excellent system of walkways and vantage points to watch the water thundering through the gorge. Lots of different picture possibilities here.Also excellent parking and picnic areas nearby.There is no long hiking trail to get there (unlike many attractions in the park), so only a drive to the site and you're there.\", 'I always love going and seeing these awesome Falls! My favourite part is after you cross the bridge, turn right and you walk down stairs where the water used to run... I always find it fascinating!Almost every time we go, there is some one climbing over a fence. There are signs every where saying how slippery the rocks are. If you go visit these falls, be warned, people have died from climbing over the fences to take pictures. The Falls are beautiful and amazing even from behind the fences so please stay safe!', 'The Falls are easy to reach. The view was breathtaking. There where 2 busloads of tourists so we waited 15 minutes till they where gone, then we had the Falls in a private session.', \"Amazing waterfalls and canyon. Like many other popular attractions in the Canadian Rockies, this too is highly accessible from car-park with only a few minutes walking.The twist is that the water hasn't always flew in the same channel, it used to flow in another parallel channel, until the water managed to beat the rock and find an alternative, better route (the current channel). So what you can see today is both the wet canyon and the dry canyon - scar that remained from the past, when water used to flow in its previous path.\", 'An amazing visit with family. The view is amazing a must see. Walking is not too bad. The amount of water going through these falls is amazing.', 'Stopped here driving from Lake Louise to Jasper to give the kids a break. For such a great view and scenic wonder this is very non-touristy. No gift shops, pay parking, guidebooks, etc but still a walkway with information boards and great access. The kids loved it. Down on the lake shore many visitors have stacked stones to mark their own visit. In many countries these would get knocked down and ruined but he they are left. Making a form of visitors book.', 'Stopped off at the falls on the way to Jasper. Well worth a walk to the far side of the falls to get the best views of the falls and the gorge below.\\nGood parking close to the falls.', 'If you are in the area do not miss this it is very cool to see how the water has carved a trench through the rock over the years. Mother Nature at her finest!!', 'Huge water fall with interesting short hike in the same area as you step through where the falls used to be. One of the better Falls in the Parks and is worth the stop.', \"This waterfall was mostly frozen, when we visited it. It was still stunning to see. Unfortunately one of the walks was blocked off due to snow, however this didn't prevent seeing some great views of the falls\", 'Perfect setting for an engagement:) We drove from Ontario to British Columbia in September of 2000 and stopped at Athabasca Falls on the way. It is beautiful, plain and simple. Definitely recommend a stop here.', 'A very pretty waterfall with a nice hike around it. Try to do the full circuit walk for views from different vantage points. We visited when it was raining lightly. The pathways were slippery but we had a very beautiful rainbow over it. One of the highlights of the trip.', \"It is a very beautiful stop. You can see the falls easily from the parking lot. However if you're looking for a hike its a really easy, beautiful, and short hike. I'd guess less than 2-3 km total. Just make sure to stay behind the barriers. The rocks here are super slippery and dangerous if you ignore the barriers.\", \"The falls is just magnificent even if it's still frozen when we went there. You would just imagine how beautiful it could be during summer when the water is fast moving. If you plan to come during the spring, you should wear good hiking and/or winter shoes for traction as the stairs and some tracks are still icy and slippery.We'll try to come back during the summer to see the difference.\", 'Athabasca falls are one of the gems along the icefield parkway from Jasper to Banff. Very easy walk from the parking lot to the falls and viewpoints just on the edge of the falls. Beware of some water puddles and spraying. Our 7 years old really enjoyed and it was also an excellent photo op.', \"We were here while there was still snow on the ground. While we had a decent time, and enjoyed the walk, I don't recommend going in the winter, especially if you have mobility issues, as the stairs are not cleared and are quite slippery. We ended up going down the stairs and then at the other side climbing up the hill to the road to have an easier walk back.\", 'Thunderous waterfall with easy access for the mobility challenged. Do NOT get close to the edge though! In addition to the \"rush\" from being close to this much water moving this fast, you may even see the resident black bear with cubs!', \"Me and my two friends stopped at Athabasca Falls on our way from skiing at Marmot Basin. It was at the end of winter, so all the other attractions along the way to Lake Louis were closed. Athabasca Falls were the only accessible through the snow and it was definitely worth stopping by.They were all frozen and it was magical to see that even such a power can freeze down and make incredible sculptures. The trail around them was covered in snow and not all open, so we had to watch our step, so we didn't fall.\", \"If you travel by car from Jasper, there's an alternative and interesting drive to the main Icefields Highway - turn right about 10km south of Jasper onto route 93A and have a relaxed and interesting drive. the road ends at the Falls, where it rejoins the Icefields Highway. The falls, although not especially high, are spectacular and the National Park management have installed walkways and a bridge that allows everyone to safely get close to many facets of the cascades.\", 'A must see while travelling. A great excuse to stop and stretch your legs and see some pretty special falls and learn some history along the way', \"We love Jasper area and make it a regular stop every year. Been coming to the falls ever since I was young. Now I bring my children. Can't wait until this year\", 'The trembling waters cutting through the mountain is amazing. Completely in awe at the sheer beauty!', \"If you're in the Jasper area in the winter, take the short 20 minute drive (not including stopping for photos of a lot of wildlife!) to the Athabasca Falls. They truly are stunning when they're frozen.When we were there in February, the river and falls were almost completely frozen solid. There was still a bit of water running, but not much. We went in the early afternoon, around 2pm. There was still enough sun to hit the ice and make it shine.Be careful of your footing, and wear proper winter footwear. The paths are someone maintained, but they are covered in snow and some ice. Common sense and good shoes will keep you safe!\", \"I love Athabasca Falls! It doesn't matter how many times I see them, I am still awed by their sheer power and beauty. I've stopped here in winter as well and the silence and stillness of these massive falls is equally impressive in winter.\", 'Athabasca Falls is my absolute favorite place to go while in Jasper. I love nature and seeing how the land, trees, and overall landscape change over time. Athabasca Falls delivers on every level. The informative plaques describe how the falls came to be, where the water once flowed and how the course has changed, and offer information on the history. Although the summer is my favorite time to visit the roaring falls I most definitely enjoyed our recent trip to the falls. As the parking lot was not cleared we ended up parking on the side of the road and walking down. Having Athabasca Falls to ourselves without a sound around but the small hole of flowing water that broke under the frozen falls was absolutely surreal! We toured around, carefully, and took pictures of the sites without having to wait for other tourists which is uncommon. I love the falls in the summer but the winter visit did not disappoint!', 'lots of areas to walk to to see the falls and the breath taking views of them roaring down was awesome!', 'We were in Jasper on the weekend looking to for a hike or a walk suitable for small children. Our 4 kids are ages 5-13 and we all loved the scenic 20 minute drive out to the falls and the short, easy walk to see the frozen waterfalls. The kids played in the snow and there are outdoor toilets nearby for potty breaks! It was free fun and we loved it. Stayed about an hour out there.', 'Right off the Ice filed Hwy heading toward Jasper, a few minutes moderate hike to the fall itself. Specular views and the sound of the water hitting of the rocks makes it that much visiting. You really get to feel the power of the water flow. Camera is a must, wonderful spots for pix. Numerous platforms to view the fall from different angles, not too busy with tourists and a must visit if travelling along the ice field parkway.', 'These falls are beautiful! There are lots of pathways and stairs so some places are not very accessible if you have mobility issues. Lots of places to take pictures and different views. I enjoyed reading all the signs and we will definitely stop here again!', \"I am only rating these falls as average as we only saw them from the road bridge which is a real shame (this is because we didn't want to be naughty and push our luck parking up on the road and wandering in which is what a lot of people seem to do)Even from the bridge you get a reasonable view of the falls and a really good impression of their magnificence, I have been in autumn and they were breath taking\", 'The sheer size of the falls and the excellent walkway with narrative boards made a very pleasant stopping place on the way to the Colombi Icefields', \"These falls are pretty much right next to the Icefields Parkway. The lot where you park is a short walk to the main falls. The falls are truly spectacular (I keep using that adjective for attractions along the Parkway, and with good reason...it's true). The sound of the water cascading over the falls is very soothing, There are several areas you can walk to to view different areas of the falls, but the one you approach first is really great. Don't pass up this attraction while travelling the Icefields Parkway. It is very worthwhile and extremely accessible.\", 'It is just fabulous, incredible colours of the water, the lake, and the trail in the woods under huge rocks makes it a must stop in Jasper!', \"Pretty short and very enjoyable hike. The falls are lovely and if it's in the summer, the water mist is very cooling and enjoyable. The trail is well shaded as well.\", 'This place is amazing in winter. The falls had frozen solid and displayed some amazing blues,greens & turquoise. The walk down to the falls was a bit dangerous and older people could easily fall. So good walking shoes are a must in the winter.', 'This short hike (which took us awhile because of how many pictures we were all taking) is an awesome way to see the beautiful glacier fed Athabasca River. The rock formations around the river are unlike anywhere I had seen before. Got some awesome photos! The walk is not too strenuous and I believe the upper portion is even handicapped accessible.', 'Athabasca Falls was something so beautiful, newer seen anything like this. We were there early morning, waiting for the first sunlight. No tourist rush, no screaming children... just calm and beautiful.', 'A must visit for everyone. Stunning visually but the sound it makes is tremendous. A video camera is essential', 'The canyon is a fascinating formation. It twists and turns, it narrows to a slot canyon than opens up into a wide waterfall. Make sure you give yourself the time to do the whole walk around the area.', 'These are majestic falls and worth a visit off the highway.It may look serene as you anter, but take a look much further in and you will not be disappointed at all. Sadly the concrete walkways detract from the natural awe and charm evident here. However, they are there to protect you from the canyon below. Do check it out if your nearby. Worth it!!!', 'Went with sun dog tours excellent trip ,stopped on way to Banff ,the power of water incredible plus the beautiful colours.', 'We went in November & the ice added to the beauty of the falls. I would highly recommend going in late autumn', 'This is a must stop see just outside of the city of Jasper! It is very safe but yet you fell so close you could almost touch it!', 'The view of the Falls is great and no one should miss it if they are in the vicinity. At the time of our visit the river was literally overflowing with ice-melted water and the view was overwhelming.', 'Easy to get to, located right off of the icefields parkway. Can get crowded do to the convenient location but definitely a must see attraction in Jasper!', 'We went to Athabasca falls on a Sunday so was more busy but was cool and sunny and spectacular. A definite place I would recommend, beautiful.', 'If you are driving by, it is worth stopping for. But it is not special enough to drive any distance to see.', 'Regardless of whatever time you view them throughout the year, the Athabasca Falls are guaranteed to be running solidly. Some excellent walkways and bridges have been added over the years which allow excellent viewing of the falls from most angles. Venture a bit further afield and you are able to view further down the river where the falls resume with the meandering river. Well worth the turnoff for the view', 'We really enjoyed walking around here. There are a number of pathways and viewpoints allowing you to get a feel for the water and how the rocks have been reshaped.A sobering memorial explains how a young guy fell off the slippery (having climbed over the guard rail!) and that a couple of people die each year! Stay behind the rails...', \"This is well worth the visit to see how the water has cut it's way through the rocks. Not very high (like Helmcken falls) but the shapes that have been carved out are amazing. You are able to walk through an area where the water used to flow but no longer does and the shapes are great to see. Good toilet facilities on site (the usual pit in the ground) and well worth a visit.\", 'You need stamina to make the trek all around the falls. There is so he areas where a wheelchair can access the falls but really you need good legs to climb stairs and rpt filed trails.', \"We came to see the natural beauty of Canada and weren't disappointed. If your going to Banff then drop past on your way there.\", \"We had considered skipping this stop but are very glad that we didn't! the falls are spectacular and are another must see in Jasper National Park.\", \"Considering it is right on the side of the road, you should definitely stop by and have a look at this. It's a lovely waterfall, with a nice river, all of it a lovely azure. It was very easy walk, and very close to the Jasper town.\", 'This is worth stopping for. Opportunity to take some beautiful photos of the falls with the mountain in background. Easy walk suitable for all. Usual restroom facilities, plenty of parking.', 'not the highest falls in Jasper but definitely one of the most beautiful... Why? Because you see the battle between water & rock. Different paths are formed & you see what what water can do with rocks. Also the trail tells you how this happens. the Trail is max 45 min and is worth every minute of your time. Easy accessible', 'Bring your camera. What an interesting geological site. The walk to the falls was easy and there were interpretive signs along the way.', 'Must do stop....it is stunning. Take hike over to lake it is lovely as well. There are quite a few different things to see there.give yourself lots of time.', 'These easily accessible falls are worth the Icefield parkway stop. The colors are amazing, as well as the cliffside \"gardens\". The falls start is turbulent which you can follow as they cascade into a aquamarine pool which will take the waters to the Arctic waters.', \"What's interesting about the rockies is that there are so many little detours you can take to see something beautiful and this is one of the ones we came across on a spontaneous road trip. The falls are gorgeous, and there's a pretty well constructed path for you to follow to experience it. Besides the $20 fee to enter Jasper National Park there's no cost to visit the individual sights in the area. This waterfall is gorgeous. though quite busy in the summer.\", \"When I got there I was a little dissapointed. Thought the attraction was just a few small falls we see right when we get there. But there is so much more. The water's color is unreal and all the rocky mountains around it make it a beautiful picture. The power of nature is stunning. Good place to stop and watch and think.\", 'These falls can be looked at from different angles. Each viewpoint opens a new vista to the onlooker. The walk in is a gentle walk. Enjoy', 'Truly spectacular falls - the day we were there was freezing cold but well worth the trip.\\nThe cuts taken out of the rocks below the falls are also spectacular', 'Was there twice this year. Once in July, where the falls wer in full force, and once in October 2013, where they were much more passive. Always a great sight to go see. One warning though, stay behind the fence. There is always someone climbing over the fence for a better picture and there has been deaths due to this. Please respect the falls.', \"This is a great place to stop and enjoy the power of nature first hand. Only steps from the highway, Athabaska Falls will let you see why and how water can carve channels in the rock. Take the short hike to the area below the falls and you'll be amazed how fast the raging torrents turn into a peaceful little bay.\", 'This is a lovely place to visit..very pretty..but there is only so long you can ooh and aah for !!! Have seen other falls as well', 'The Athabasca Falls is a must see if you are in Jasper! It is really only accessible to see in the late spring, summer and early fall months of the year. It is closed in the winter for your safety as the road offers poor driving conditions in the winter months. This is wonderful spot for photographers - with the majestic mountain background, the flowing Athabasca River that leads to the falls, the sweeping deep canyons formed over the years and the hard rushing falling water makes your images ones you will treasure forever. You can drive here yourself or you can take a bus tour to get here. It is better if you can drive yourself as then you can take your time at the falls. Also, driving on your own you can then drive to the nearby \"Meeting Of The Waters\" which is where the Whirlpool River meets the Athabasca River. As the waters meet rushing side by side - one side is crystal clear and clean while the other side is muddy. There are many little places to stop and see along the way if you drive on your own to the Athabasca Falls - and if you have the time and continue along highway 93 or even highway 93A you can visit Lake Louise for the day. So much beauty to take in to the Athabasca Falls and from the Athabasca Falls. Enjoy!', 'This is well worthwhile. The scenery and the roar of the falls one of Jasper parks nice (and noisy) attractions.', 'This is another example of nature creating an exceptional and transforming way for water to travel. The formations and crevices, magnified by the unusual color of the water, create magnificent art to enjoy right by the parking lot. Take time to enjoy and walk down by the canyon as well.', 'Driving from Jasper to Banff this was one of our first stops and defiantly one of the high lights! With many viewing points the waterfall drops away violently into the canyon and exits a calm pale stream. Truly breath taking.', 'We visited these falls trowards the end of a cold, snowy day and this added to the drama. That said, the water colour was a stunning sapphire blue. The Falls are easily accessible from the car park which is itself, just off of the Icefields Parkway. I wish I could remember the name of the mountain on the opposite side of the Parkway but the imposing presence of this added to the atmosphere.', 'Beautiful falls right off the Iceburg Parkway and easy to walk to. Worth stopping to see and enjoy the sights!!', 'Must be able to manage a few steps. Salutary lesson about previous casualties at the falls. Liked the peace and quiet of the lower canyon', 'The falls are fearsome and demonstrate the power of nature. Be sure to walk down the trail of the old path of the falls to see how the water originally flowed and look back up across to the bridge to see how high up you are from the falls.', 'There is quite the view of this waterfall. Amazing how much water can shape the land and rocks around it. Take a walk down the path to see all the sites', 'I loved the sound it made, in early summer it must be absolutely deafening. There were also lots of squirrels around', 'This is easily accessible and has several bridges that allow different vantages of the falls. It has ample parking and can be busy when tour buses pull into the parking lot. There are several view points along the route, though, and some great photo ops.', 'Lots of people know about this place, just off the Hwy, lots of parking available, a smaller falls but lots of power and great trails to see it all. Take pictures!', 'This one gorgeous falls. It was in the Fall when I arrived, I would love to see it in the Spring when runoff occurs.', 'Got beautiful photos here, even with the mountains hidden in clouds, the falls are still pretty. Somewhat crowded with buses and large tour groups though.', 'Take tour time when visiting Athabasca Falls. There are so many nooks and diversions with numerous viewpoints that it is hard not to miss at least some of them. The falls are gorgeous (excuse the pun)! We started off in cloudy weather and had to redo all the photography stuff when eventually the sun broke through.', 'stunning beauty all around!! right off the parkway. great views of the river and mountains.\\npart of the trail from the parking lot to the falls is paved.', \"This was just part of a spectacular day travelling between banff and Jasper. We'll worth seeing and a memory which will live with me forever\", 'During our trip thru the mountains, we stopped to visit the Athabasca Falls. We are certainly glad we did. It was fall and the air was crisp and smelled amazing. Loved the hike to get to see the falls and could have stayed and gazed at them for hours. It was great being there off season as there were not hordes of people to contend with. Tons of great photo opportunities!! I encourage anyone travelling in the area to stop at the Athabasca Falls. Loved it!!!', 'A two hour visit, with the river forcing itself through a devils cauldron and carving a canyon through to the other side. Well laid out for tourists to visit all aspects.', 'Water floe is don this year, End of Sept. Have stopped there several time, good stop. The falls are always interesting, even with lower water flow.', 'We spent almost an hour here walking around, taking pictures, and looking at all the beauty of the fall. Definitely worth the stop. No strenuous hiking required.', 'We took the trail along the canyon. At the bridge, it was hard to see the water because the canyon is so narrow, and the river is a long way down. The falls are beautiful, and well worth the short hike.', 'was on the list and could see this was rated on TA. It was on the way from/to Jasper but we made the trip on the way from jasper to calgary. This place is easy to locate and just 200 meters from the highway and the falls is just right next to the parking lot. came here and was amazed - took the usual photos and off on our way along the IP. we probably took 30 mins max staying at this place (sadly during our week it was getting chilly [end of sept] so you just want to take photos and get out of there lol so I would say during summer time would be nice to hang around and have lunch here or a snack)', 'Athabasca Falls is located in the Jasper National Park. The falls were formed by the water over many thousands of years. The trail along the river is well worth the visit. One portion of the trail goes through a slot that was abandoned by the water many years ago. The rock formations along the wall are very interesting. The trail is not suited for strollers or wheelchairs. Also water your young children as the water is running fast and one of the benches along the trail is dedicated to a young man that slipped and fell into the water. The tour buses stop here so go early to avoid the crowds.', \"This is an easy walk to view the falls and they are worth the walk. You can actually climb down the trail through parts of the canyon to the river and perhaps get lucky and see white water rafters. This canyon engages you to imagine the water rushing through here thousands of years ago and it shows what strength water has. Don't be afraid to get wet at the actual falls as water sprays high into the air. A must see on the Jasper Parkway.\", 'Check it out! Even my 2 year old thought that the falls were fantastic!! You really do not have to walk too far, to be able to see the falls!', 'The falls were quite fierce...we took this on put way from Lake Louise to Jasper.... kids were quite excited.', 'Lots of good view points to see different angles of the falls. Well worth exploring them all. This is not far from jasper.', 'These falls were one of the highlights of our trip to Canada. They are beautiful to behold and there are lots of information plaques to read about how they were formed. The water is so blue.', \"Beautiful and great for photos. Short walk around worth the great views. You can even build your own inukshuk down at the lower lake. Stunning and a sight you won't forget\", 'Loud in places, bit of a spray. Nice views. plenty of visitors.\\nPlenty of viewing platforms all around.', \"If you haven't seen Athabasca falls you're missing out on a great attraction. I've seen them about 5 times in my life, the first time when I was a child of 7yrs old. It's a must see,you'll enjoy it.\", 'If you are travelling along the Icefield Parkway, it is worth taking a short stop en route to visit the Athabasca Falls, which in late September are not too busy.', 'Worth a look although it is busy, lots of tourists, coaches etc. we did the walk around and down the the lower falls as it is good to stretch your legs.', \"It's worth the hike to see the falls. There are many beauty spots in The Rockies, but this is one of those that's worth a detour!\", \"The falls have carved out a very interesting route though the rocks. We found them full and rushing. The drop off toward the river was narrow and steep. It's amazing what water over time can create. Worth a stop.\", 'A neat stop, well suited to tourists and geologists alike. Lots of designated viewing areas, well thought out.', 'This one has to be seen. Cascading massive falls coming from the Athabasca Glacier. A walkway around makes viewing safe for all, although it can be crowded at busy times.', \"Amazing falls / canyon - a must see if passing through this area.\\nParking is close to the falls so not a long walk - there are also pathways all around the area so it's easy to walk round and take in the spectacular views.\", 'One of the falls on Ice Parkway. Nice roaring water fall in summer.\\nShould visit if you are on Ice parkway.', 'Wonderful sight and must be done as part of any visit to Western Canada.\\nHighly recommended.\\nWe were very impressed at the natural washrooms in every sightseeing spot in the National Parks.', \"The Athabasca Falls are magnificent and one of the many spots we always take our Alberta visitors to. For the most part the walking is easy but there is a lower view which can be challenging to anyone not steady on their feet.If you are visiting Jasper don't miss this wonder of nature.\", 'How can water falling give you such a good feeling? This is a stunning area near Jasper. Wonderful place.', \"If we were to advise someone going to Jasper for the first time, we'd tell you not to miss this. It's close to the freeway, doesn't require any hiking to see it, and it is absolutely spectacular.\", 'one of the many stops you can take while driving along the icefield parkway. a nice trail leads to the fallls. the falls is great for photographs.', 'It is not signed very well from the parking lot, but follow the sound of the water. You view the falls from a number of angles. The paths are paved and the walk is not too strenuous, even the walk back up. You can follow the canyon down to a beach area where people have built several inikshuks.', 'This place is a must when in the area. Lots of viewing areas. Beautiful area to walk around. I have never seen anything so amazing. Not to be missed.', 'Absolutely worth viewing. It would have stood out more as an amazing sight if we had not have tried to cram so much into one day of taking in such incredible geological wonders. Wish we had more time to spread it out. Try to do so.', 'These are beautiful falls. Just off the road and crowded, but well worth a stop. There are many places around the falls to get many varied views.', \"A must visit just to see the power of the water. Lovely on a hot day with the must spraying on your face. A nice walk to the bottom to the 'pebble beach' where you can build your own Inuksuk!\", \"Not well signed off the Parkway, so keep a lookout. We nearly missed it and we were keeping an eye out for the turnoff when driving southbound.It's approximately 35 km south of Jasper. Lots of parking. Superb views of the falls and river from the walkways. We got there about 09.30 and the car park was empty. We had the place to ourselves. Great views of the Athabasca river. The water over the first set of falls was in full flow and we could hear the roar from the car park. The river has cut lots of interesting shapes into the rock, some of which it has now abandoned and which you can walk through. Fabulous - and free..\", 'Be sure to visit here, the hike to the Glaciers (two) is moderate, maybe a little steep, but I am 78 and made it so you can. It is worthwhile', 'Good attraction but long walk if you are not a bus or invalid. Walk if steep and hard for the unfit so if you are aged or unfit go up to the next car park and the walk from here is just a short walk.', 'A must-see stop along the Icefields Parkway. The wide river funnels into a very narrow rock canyon that has some unusual forms and shapes. Good walk-ways and overlooks are provided.', \"The loud roar and clouds of mist coming from the falls emphasizes how much power is being corralled by the rocks around these falls. Don't miss this attraction.\", 'This waterfall is one of the best places for a close up of falls. With the Rocky Mountains topping it, the scene is one of a kind. Between the trees the mountains and the falls appear as if they are a natural camera view. This is the second time for me to see it and never stopped being impressed.', 'Athabasca Falls gives more bank for the buck than most other waterfall sites. It is easily accessible from the well-maintained parking lot. It is best viewed in the Fall, when there are far fewer tourists. Even so, the path is well marked with interpretive signs and the falls are amazing as they plunge over rocks and course through a steep canyon.', 'Brilliant, best waterfall between Jasper and Banff, definitely worth a stop whilst on the Icefields parkway', 'Beautiful, powerful - lots of energy!! We were very close to the falls - closer than you can get at Niagara. You really get the sense of the power because of the closeness. Worth seeing!!!', 'Typical Canadian scenery well organised and well worth the visit. Its not Niagara but still an amazing sight.', 'These falls were running very fast when we visited and the flow was impressive. The track was well maintained and lookouts situated in some good places. Truly another marvel of Mother Nature.', 'Have stopped here over 100 times, and never get tired of it. Looks amazing in every weather, any season. Make sure to follow the path down to the river! (turn right after you crossed the bridge)', \"First week of September still great flow of water. Can't imagine how it must look in spring and early summer! Pathways and overlooks well maintained.\", 'its not as big as niagra falls (not even close), but you do get to see the falls up close without having to get on a boat and sail towards it. its is a convenient accessible site.', \"Me and my fiance stopped by, as we were staying at Whistler's campground in Jasper. Its about a 30 minute scenic drive from their. She thought that the falls were a little boring but I thought they were beautiful. We only spent five-ten minutes at the falls and were able to see from all the vantage points. Make sure you were an extra layer if you want to stay for a while because it cools down around the falls.\", \"Definitely worth the stop and the very short walk to the view. It is very popular so you don't feel like you're off the beaten track but you should not miss is.\", 'cool mountain water rushing over rocks and cliffs....thrilling! careful that you wear good shoes as it can get slippery with the spray of water. there is hand rails so you can get great photos!', 'Okay place to see some fall, but not something I would put at the top of our list. Better to hike somewhere and see some of the remote falls', \"One of the most beautiful falls I have ever seen. Easy access to the site off of the main highway into Jasper. Don't miss this if you are in the area. Parts of the area are handicapped accessible, but most are not. Plan on spending at least 30 minutes here as some of the most spectacular sites are when you cross over the bridge to the other side of the falls. The fast flow of water is amazing.\", \"look at the rock formation and the canyon, to see the force of nature and power of water. This is easily accessible, large body of water fall, good paths to walk along, and even somewhat hidden picnic tables just upstream that we totally missed and settled for the picnic area next to parking lot.Next time, I'll walk 100 ft upstream and spend an hour eating my sandwich lunch box there.Certainly not Niagara, but this is the best one in Banff-Jasper corridor.\", \"The Athabasca Falls were beautiful. We spent some time hiking and then just sitting and enjoying the sound of the rushing water. We took some great pictures. There were alot of people but the sound of the water keeps the area quiet and you really don't hear people talking.\", 'Very scenic and a camera is a must, however, there are chipmunks that throw pine cones at you (seriously) :-)', 'Well worth a visit. The falls are very deceptive initially but up close are quite spectacular. The cost is .... well free! Go early and there are very few people but the sun is shining into your lens. Later in the day may be better for photos. Either way, they are well worth a visit.', 'Not quite Niagara, but these are impressive falls nonetheless, and they provide some excellent photo opportunities.', 'You really see the power of water here. The falls drops to a gorge and swirls around in a dance of beauty. Once again it,s great to see that Alberta is not greedy and the charge is $0.00. The surounding mountains make this a perfect spot to see the power of God,s creation', 'Worth getting up early so you can get there before the crowds. Take a little time to go to all the viewpoints and then walk down to the bottom. The walk down is stairs cut into the old path of the falls so pretty cool to see up close the channels cut.', 'If you\\'re on the Icefields Parkway, you\\'d be foolish to skip this. Falls are beautiful; accessible. Rainbow when the sun is shining through the mist. The walk down to the bottom is easy and it\\'s fun to walk through the \"old\" canyon.', \"Maybe we are spoiled having seen Niagara, or some of the fantastic falls in Iceland such as Gullfoss but we were all complete underwhelmed by these falls. Are they nice ? Yes. Does the whirlpool current at the base create interesting circular erosion patterns ? yes. Does all the walk ways stink of stale urine ? yes, which is disgusting as Jasper National Park is full of bathrooms. Anyway, if you are driving by these falls why wouldn't you go look at them. But in our humble opinion, and we maybe have been spoiled by other falls in the world, these falls are small and Jasper has much more to offer.\", 'This is a powerful waterfall, not like most of what you see coming down the high mountains. You see it as it drops over a huge gorge it has created. & is really unusual. You have to walk a little but it was worth it.', \"Not everyone who visits the Rockies is a considerate traveller. The ease of getting to Athabasca Falls is offset by the shear number of tourists which can make the experience less enjoyable. Try not to visit on a long weekend or get there before 10 am. Be sure to cross the pedestrian bridge as views from the far side are compelling. Thankfully there are picnic tables in the parking lot (though not many of them) so it's a nice place to stop for lunch.\", 'Nice walking trails to view the falls from many vantage points. A nice, quick and easy stop to incorporate in your day.', 'I loved it and this was about my 3rd visit there. Great location for people with mobility issues, the paths are all paved but there are some stairs if you want to go further on the path.', 'Although it is not a very high waterfall, its force is amazing. The walk is easy, even for small children, and very scenic.', \"Don't miss out on seeing this attraction. Truly beautiful. It can get very busy here, so I'd suggest visiting the falls in the early morning.\", 'We were exhausted from hiking but were still able to walk down and see the falls. Paved walkways, close views, nice bridges, and really designed for tourists.', \"It's only a short drive off the Icefields Parkway so why not check it out? For us it was a one-time deal. There were large, annoying crowds of people watching water tumble over some rocks into a deep channel. It was OK for a waterfall.\", \"Worth the 30 - 45 mins it takes to see the attraction. Stay on the pathways and you'll get some great photos.\", 'Easy to get to and very accessible to all. These are very nice falls and well presented with the layout of the paved trail. Nice although it was very busy which I suspect is usually the case.', 'Go early in the morning to avoid the crush of people, but the amazing nature at her best is on display. Close by some great trails for hiking too.', \"Loved this place - our first stop-off on the drive from Jasper to Banff. Not very well signposted but really worth an hour's visit to explore the wonders of these amazing waterfalls and gorge.\", 'These falls are striking, just off the Icefields Parkway and a stop here provides a nice break on your drive between Lake Louise and Jasper.', 'These were smaller but seemed just as powerful as Niagara Falls and you get to go right up to it! Great experience. Made the entire Jasper detour from Banff worth it alone.', 'We enjoyed visiting Athabasca Falls and walking the different trails. This is one place the tourist buses come so it was a bit crowded but was still worth the visit. After walking the standard route to the falls, we took the stairs through the gorge down to the river and then walked about ten minutes along the river bank. There are other trails that go along the river before the falls that we walked. The best thing to do if you have an hour or two is to get away from the main falls and take the trails to see the sights and the river.', \"This was a great spot. The falls and the resulting canyons were very cool. Stay away from the edge, we saw a bench dedicated to a young man who lost his life falling in the falls - interesting but sad.Definitely worth a stop if your on the Icefield's highway.\", 'Beautiful falls with easy access for all ages. Walking a bit further than the first bridge is worth the small hike down and back.', 'This place is a must-see if you are anywhere in the area of Jasper. It is amazing! You will not regret spending time here.', \"I don't know how many times I am going to say this about attractions around Japer but another must see absolutely beautiful\", 'beautiful! will take your breath away.I liked everything about this! Would definately go see this attractionagain.', 'Alright... there are water falls all over, but not many like one. It seemed like just another place we ought to stop, but it was well worth an hour, The rock formations and the raging water are breath taking. This is worth a whole camera chip. It is difficult to know when to stop taking photos.', \"The Falls are well worth the stop, seeing a wide river narrowed into a 10' wide cut in the rock. You will be able too see the falls from 3-4 different angle and they are breath taking. A path trails along the channel below the falls about a 1/4 mile to where the river widen again to continue it trip to the Arctic ocean. Don't miss the fantastic experience right off the Ice Fields Parkway.\", 'If you like waterfalls, rainbows, river and mountain scenery and interesting rocks this is the place for you.', 'The power and beauty is second to none. Fabulous photo ops and well planned walking areas. You could spend hours wandering and never getting bored of the beauty around you.', 'Come early in Summer and on a weekday if you can. If you leave Jasper around 9am, you will get there before any crowds and have the place almost to yourself.', 'This was well served by a large car and coach park and there are viewing areas in several places around the top of the falls and as you walk down through the old channels to the river below. The power of the water and the never-ending flow are just wonderful to watch!', 'Make sure you stop off to see this attraction ,a 5 minute walk from the car park and the noise and sight of rushing water through the rock canyon is spectacular, another short walk to the foot of the falls leads you to a large opening to the river with far reaching views.', 'The falls are more complex than I expected. There were many different vantage points for viewing from different angles. A bit of exercise rewards one with even more sights, well worth it!', 'Very pretty rainbow over the falls. Have seen bigger and better but this was very nice. It only took a few minutesb ut was well worth the trip.', 'always a great stop. well worth seeing. impressive and beautiful. the falls are amazing and the walking paths and viewing platforms and veru well done.', \"This is a great experience and an easy to get to place with superb walkways etc. The parking and 'long drop' toilets are good. Providing you stay on the walkways the whole experience is safe and gives one a memorable trip out. whilst you are in the area ride up to Mount Edith Cavell and see the beautiful Angel Glacier.\", 'During our stay in Jasper one of the great spots we visited was the Athabasca Falls. They are quite interesting and lovely to look at. The Athabasca River pours into a narrow canyon that it has carved out over hundreds of years and one can feel the power of the water as it gushes through. Just to the side of it there is another canyon where the river many years ago used to go through. A long time ago it must have found a weaker spot and started carving through there so now the old canyon sits dry. Makes one wonder if somewhere under that torrent of water another weaker spot in the rock is being slowly worn away to eventually form another new canyon of the future.Great falls to visit with not far to walk from the carpark. We had a picnic lunch there, beautifull spot, one to visit for sure', 'This is an excellent place to take kids or your elders to see falls. The walk is a very short jaunt from the parking lot and the views are spectacular! Definitely a must see if your are in the Jasper area!', \"I love waterfalls and this didn't fail to please....worth a visit. Great scenery, deep gorges and plunging water.\", 'There are a number of water falls in Jasper and Banff National Parks. However, this is one of the most breath taking. Do not miss it!', 'Peaceful, relaxing and beautiful. We took a bunch of photos and\\nthey turned our awesome. Would visit again.', \"A very special place due to the physics with the river and the canyon it's created. Not many you can drive to in Alberta like this one.\", 'Well worth a stop, make sure you wander round it in all directions, the power and beauty of this is awesome', \"Been here several times and always stop to take another look. The falls and surrounding area are beautiful and the way in which the water sculpts the surrounding rock is fascinating including in one area where you can walk down into a chasm that was carved by water than no longer flows through that area. There are several walkways and viewpoints that enhance the experience so well done on that front with the only negative being the same as always in the mountain parks - crowds in the summer - unavoidable and can't blame anyone - so enjoy the falls.\", 'The fall itself and the presentation of it, meaning the explanations and all, was really good. I would recommend all to stop by a take the easy trail to see the falls. Especially when we went, a lot of water so it made the falls a sight to see.You have got to see it!', 'Such a lovely place. The river sweeps round and then tumbles down a gorge it has cut in the rock. The observation places are very good. Car parking is easy and it is close to the highway.', 'In the vicinity of Jasper Tramway (approx. 20km away) and a such beautiful natural wonder. Perfect for all ages.', 'To see a substantial river flow over a fall and squeeze through a narrow gorge is an awe inspiring sight. The viewing areas are safe with good sight-lines to the rapids above and the gorge below as well as the falls themselves. Although the parking lot was pretty full there is room enough for people to spread out and take time to enjoy this spectacle of nature.You need a parks pass but there is no separate fee for the falls', 'The area is so well kept ... read all the signs, the history and development of the falls. Its amazing!', 'Not much to say go see it! There are all kinds of beautiful in nature and this is a gem in the Jasper area.', 'Short drive from Jasper are the incredible Athabasca falls. Awesome display of nature and the power it holds. Well worth the visit!', \"We drove to Athabasca Falls one morning from Jasper via 93A. The scenery on the way is great, and the falls are impressive. It's a good idea to get there early before the crowds. There are outdoor privies in the parking lot--they don't smell great but are no worse than those at other scenic stops.\", 'Just the best waterfall and so easy to access from the road... Took fantastic photos and enjoyed uninterrupted views of the water pounding through the narrow rocky pass from the bridge and the easy walkway.', \"Raw power of nature in the wild. It's incredible to think that these falls have been there for hundreds of years.\", 'Some of the most exciting things you will see in Jasper National Park are the falls carving out deep gorges. This drop in the Athabasca River is a well maintained interpretive trail with many overlooks on the river falls and into the deep gorge it carves. It is a great stop. And short hike.', \"Worth stopping by but bathrooms smelled horribly. Bring your camera and don't be scared to go down step to lower level.\", 'Worth stopping to see, it is just off the highway. Great for picture taking or just to relax and watch the falls.', 'The falls were quite convenient to the Icefields Parkway and we had the pleasure of seeing a small black bear browsing in the bushes along the access road. There is adequate parking and the trails are well-designed for the average photographer.', \"Lots of people around but that doesn't stop one being able to enjoy the spectacular falls and pleasant walks\", 'We visited the falls on a Saturday and it was busy....but the grounds are large enough to spread out the guests so it has a less crowded feel. Parks Canada has down an excellent job of constructing walkways and decks to maximize the access to and views of the falls without obstrcuting the natural apppearance of the falls. They are quite something...they remind me a little of the Rhine Falls in Schauffhausen Switzerland. I would have gone back for a second visit but time did not allow. Parking was no problem. The rainbow in the fall mist was a special treat. We got some great pics that may be enlarged and hung on walls here at home.', \"It's a short hike on a well marked path to visit the falls - you can get very close on both sides by crossing a bridge. We were very happy that we included this on our day trip from Jasper.\", 'The power of these falls is something to behold! Some crazy people climbed over the protective railing to get a closer look - something I would not recommend! (Those who have slipped into the water have not survived!)

From the road you can see the mist from the falls, but have no idea of its power until you're up close!\", 'Beautiful falls albeit small in comparison to Something like Niagara. Great photo opportunities and scenery is beautiful. Definitely worth visiting.', 'When the river is high as it was when I visited the force of the water falling in such a small space is almost frightening. There is not much walking to see the attraction and it is worth a stop.', 'Fantastic scenery and no need to hike for hours to get there. It does get crowded in the summer though;', \"These are incredible waterfalls easily accessible from road that should not be missed. After long day of driving, it's great to get out and experience the beauty in person (but having bug spray helps).\", 'Tremendous falls well worth taking the time to see.

The waterfall was strong and powerful and we saw a beautiful rainbow right on top of the waterfall. We also enjoyed the nice little hike.

It's a short walk from parking lot making it an easy to tour.\", 'The falls are very nice and many boards explain its formation but as it is accessed from the highway, pretty much everyone stops there for a while and it is very crowded.You can cross on the other side of the falls to get really close and get some refreshing spray from the falls, the kids loved getting a bit wet!', \"A beautiful stop, right off the Ice Fields Parkway. Don't miss this and keep driving by. You could spend 5 minutes or an hour here, there were a few trails and different vantage points. The falls are magnificient.The infrastructure could maybe use a bit of upkeep, but parks infrastructure isn't a priority of our current government.Parking in the main lot was busy, but there was an upper, RV kind of lot that had lots of room if needed.\", 'Absolutely beautiful falls with water carved channels!\\nA bit crowded at one point but the tour bus didnt stay too long.', 'Were with a trip and this was one of the stopovers. It was amazing, we went on to the Glacier - a must if in the area.', 'We stop here each time we come to Jasper regardless of the season. Always impressive. Phenomenal amount of water. Make sure to stop and check it out.', \"I've now visited the Athabasca Falls twice. Both times the stop was well worth it. On this occasion we were also lucky enough to see a black bear. The kids enjoyed the break from driving and the walking around. Some great photos at this location and the information posted is also very good.\", 'This is by far the most impressive of the waterfalls in the Rockies and you can certainly see why it is the No 1 attraction. About 30 mins south of Jasper on the Icefields Parkway. The power of the water is incredible and the sink holes it has created; the rock formations are impressive. The river before them is also very pretty.Much of the area is paved and mostly accessible by wheelchair, but there is a further walk down by steps and trails. You should take a jacket as it was much cooler down there at the beginning of July.This is one you should make a point of visiting if you are on the Parkway.Hole in the ground style toilets - need baby wipes.', \"when you are driving down the icefields parkway, this is certainly a must do stop, the waterfall is amazing and one of the biggest I've seen so far. When you are driving from jasper take 93a if you want to see some wildlife, if you're driving from lake louise take the exit to Athabasca Falls and drive the 93a to jasper if you want to see some wildlife ;)\", 'Wonderful attraction very close to parking. They have done an excellent job melding tourist accommodations (Pathways etc) and the beautiful rock formations and waterways of the Athabasca Falls.', 'Recent rain made for an incredible water flow -- rainbow and all. Our photo touring group captured the area with videos and images. Worth the stop.', 'the all around scenery was beautiful and many different areas to look at and see the view.

Loved it! the view is fantastic and there are lots of great photo opportunities', 'Wonderful falls close to Jasper and a definite stop on the Icefields Parkway. Amazing how the water has carved out the shapes in the rocks. Easy access to different viewpoints.

Seeing the previous pathway of the water is a unique experience.', \"When you're driving down the Icefields Parkway, make sure you do a quick stop at the Athabasca Falls. Watching the water thunder down the chasm, seeing the sprays and the rainbows...amazing!\", 'The Athabasca Falls were different from every angle, quite mysterious & very scary..difficult to get a photo that truly depicted the power of these falls.', \"Very powerful falls, right off the main road.

The short walk ends at a calm part of the river with a beautiful view\", 'The Athabasca Falls are a must see in Jasper. The pathways around the falls are well maintained and easy to walk on.

The site offers a very nice paved trail alongside and over the falls, allowing them to be seen top left and right, across, and bottom right. The trail has panels which explain the falls and the way they developed, as well as the impact on vegetation. There is even a walk down a canyon that used to be part of the falls which shows a large pothole. The water sprays in places which is refreshing on a summer day, but also makes the pathway slippery in places. Allow 45 minutes for the visit.', 'These falls are spectacular. Be sure and see them for all advantages. Have been all over US and Europe and have seen many falls. These falls are only rivaled by some falls we saw in Switzerland that had 9 falls inside of a mountain!', 'Amazing, wild waterfalls. You can get really close to them and they are awesome. The water was high due to the recent rains.', \"This is a nice photo op but not much else since being right alongside the parkway you get scores of tour buses disgorging themselves from time-to-time which is annoying as most don't even speak English\", \"These are magnificent falls that can be viewed from a variety of positions. In addition, there is a trail through the trees - a good relief from the bright sunshine - but watch out for the mozzies. There are a number of points of information along the way that add interest to the walk. In places the spray from the falls reaches the paths so appropriate footwear is probably a good idea. Don't miss these falls when driving the Icefield Parkway.\", 'Only 30 minutes away from Jasper the waterfalls are quite spectacular.

Saw a bear on the way... made the trip exciting.', \"I'm used to paddling the top white-water rivers in the UK.\\nThis takes it to another level - not the most beautiful of falls (the review of Maligne Canyon still to come) but definitely the most impressive in terms of scale.\", \"Overall, Jasper is gorgeous. Athabasca falls are not too far from the city of Jasper, and they're easy to find. The falls themselves are not like Niagara Falls, but they are a different kind of beauty, with charm and very fitting for the mountains. Especially with the mountain backdrop ! There is a concrete path going around there so it's easy to get around. That and there are information signs telling you the history and info on the falls.

It is only a short walk to the first bridge and you can continue walking if you want', \"I wasn't expecting to be so close to the waterfall - it was wonderful to feel the cool air movement and fine mist, caused by the immense power of the water crashing through the surrounding rocks. The information boards were fascinating and the whole area is a hikers delight. Great place to visit.I had to deduct one point, however, because the worst public toilets in Jasper National Park are on this site. All the others around the park are relatively clean, well serviced with loo paper and hand sanitizer, and they do not smell. Not so at Athabasca Falls and the smell inside the cabins was terrible. Don't be put off visiting the Falls because they are fabulous - just use the toilets en route, further down the road leading to the attraction.\", 'Easy to reach from the highway and accesible for all. Perfect place to take a picture while in Canada.', \"can't describe the beauty of the falls , while gazing the athabasca falls with its water flowing the stairway sculptured rocks, a view of the beautiful multi- colored mountain also captured your attention.\", 'There are many viewpoints with minimal walking.

There are a good few nice little walks around too.\", \"I loved seeing Sumwapta Falls but then just a short time later we stopped at Athabasca Falls and that just topped the trip! I'd highly recommend stopping in and hiking around. There are several trails and lots of information about Athabasca Falls along the way. You really get a sense of just how powerful water is when you see the deeply gouged canyons. Definitely worth the trip!\", 'The spray from the thundering waterfalls was extremely refreshing on the day we visited. The double rainbows that could be seen in the spray were absolutely stunning.

Wow!', \"Don't go out of your way to visit but if you are driving south of Jasper towards Banff, make this a half hour break, take your camera and go for a walk and enjoy the falls. Watch out for the busloads of Asian tourists who are swarming with their cameras, wanting their own private shots but not concerned about walking in front of your shots.

A good discovery and one I would recommend seeing!', 'Simply magnificent. Be certain to go down to the outflow where it opens out into a serene river and watch for the small animals that call this area home.', 'Very impressive falls with great walking trails built around it. The falls are very close and very powerful, great way to witness the forces of nature (awe inspiring). Not the tallest falls but the volume of water and strength of the falls make up for that. Walk around the trails and you can get over to a rock beach where my kids built a little rock sculpture (others had already done some).', 'A first stop of many on a day long coach journey from Jasper to Banff and only a short distance from the highway. A short easy walk brings you to the falls and there are viewing platforms at various heights to see the cascade from different angles. Well worth the stop and we could have stayed longer but the coach itinerary did not permit this unfortunately. Look out for orchids!. They are easy to miss.

We visited Maligne Canyon the previous day so we had a good appreciation of how the canyons form etc. The track here is much shorter than Maligne Canyon and can be done in 20 minutes or so. You walk through a canyon and you can view the falls and the river from a number of viewing platforms. The falls are beautiful and the power of the water is quite spectacular. Well worth stopping for.', 'Take the stairs down to the bottom of the falls and enjoy the rocky shoreline and whitewater rafters starting their journey', 'Amazing power of water!!!

An amazing display of the beauty and force of nature and all for free.', \"These falls need some time to walk around the pathways to truly experience their beauty. Great picture opportunities. Make an effort to stop in. You won't be disappointed.\", 'Worth a stop off if passing, the falls were in full flow with the meltwater and there are good viewing points. My only criticism woud be the design of the walkways which seemed o be built in concrete and seemed at odds with the natural environment, design flaw maybe?', \"Short walk to the falls, and beautiful picture opp's.

Definitely worth a stop if you are on the Icefields Parkway.', \"Certainly a must see on any trip to Jasper - I was surprised at the large crowds as we hadn't seen a lot of people until this point in our trip. The falls are spectacular and you'd be missing something wonderful if you didn't stop. Easy to do this in 30-45 minutes and take it all in - bring the camera.

Our visit was topped off with a close encounter with several deer who, while wild, are obviously used to tourists on their patch.', 'This is a beautiful waterfall and you can walk some trails to see it from various viewpoints. Since this is a Canadian National Park, you never pay entry fees to see the sites. Certainly well worth the stop.', 'A must see site on Highway 93 from Banff to Jasper as the falls are formed on the Athabasca River in the form of an hour glass. The wide river narrows into a canyon at the falls and the rock carvings are created by the sand and gravel rubbing at high speed with the rock face and creating a deep crevice. The downstream side of the fall is also very beautifu, A must-see.', \"Don't miss this place. See the beautifully carved rock canyon walls. Be astounded by the ongoing battle of rushing water against hard rocks. If you are short of time, a quick visit will take about 30 to 45 minutes..\"]\n"

      "\"I always saw the sign along the highway but never stopped, thinking it was just another waterfall. When I finally stopped to see it I was amazed at how rugged and powerful it truly is. Don’t miss this glorious wonder of nature.\"\"I very pleasant spot and one that doesn't require much effort to visit.If you are into photography you might want to time your visit to catch the best light, early morning will mean that you are shooting into the sun.\"\"Can't see much of the fall, and it's kind of small. Also, slipped on the ice and bruised my left elbow, so be careful. Viewpoint was limited.\"\"The Athabasca Falls are just breathtaking in winter!There is parking just a few hundred meters away so it is safe to go there even when it’s snowing.Snow and ice just made it more pretty!\"\"Visited here in late October. The canyon and waterfall were beautiful - a variety of colours, textures. And the surroundings were very quiet. I spent 1 hour walking through the area and enjoying the view.\"The cliffs and the jagged edges were unbelievable. You good see layers of different times in the rocks. Wow a really good place to see.\"Food for thought: Go early. We had the unfortunate luck of arriving at the same time as ALL the tour buses... Needless to say there was scarce room to breathe, let alone enjoy the scenery. Nothing against the site in itself, it was just too people-y for me.\"\"Simply amazing!Please go and enjoy nature!Is a must!!Beautiful scenery!!Breath taking.Be ready to walk if you wanna see it all.\"This falls is about 25 km from Jasper and is worth a visit. A spectacular geological history cab be observed from this area.Absolutely breathtaking. Well worth the drive. Part of the Rockies at their best. Our second trip and would definitely go back again.\"The Athabasca falls are about 1/2 an hour outside of Jasper - easy to find and not a bad drive to get there. Lots of parking available, trails are well marked, and points of interest clearly identified.Once there, you are immersed in the natural beauty of the area. The falls are surrounded by rock outcroppings that really make you recognize how long this area has existed. There are multiple short trails to follow, each leading to interesting findings at the end. The falls are very impressive, and fast moving. Take a couple of hours to visit this site - you won't be disappointed.\"\"This is a must to visit, great views and an easy drive either in your own car or on an organised tour from the local hotels.Long or short walks to see the views. Ok for fit oldies like my wife and I but could be hard work for some.Wheelchair access would be possible but not for every path, quite a lot of steps and tree roots etc. to negotiate.We took lots of pictures and spectacular scenery.Enjoy this exceptional place!Chris and Helen\"\"Athabasca falls was an enjoyable experience. There is plenty of parking, washrooms, and information regarding the falls. The terrain is interesting and there are trails to get to and explore the different sections. The falls are located about 30 minutes or so south of Jasper, very easy to get to with good road signage. They are located just off the main highway. Overall, a fun, pleasant time.\"\"The falls are stunning, noisy fast flowing water in beautiful surroundings. The path around the falls is really good as you get different views all around. There is also a path and steps to the bottom of the falls where the water is still and a beatiful green colour, lots of places to take in the scenery and capture photos.Like other places it was quite busy with bus tours when we visited but not over crowded to be able to enjoy the falls and the views.\"The waterfall is about a 30 minute drive from the Jasper city centre. From the car park it is only a couple of minutes to walk to the waterfall. The trails are well laid out and a bridge takes you to the other side so you can take many photos from various angles. When you cross the bridge don't forget to take the trail to the right as well. This will take you down some stairs through the old Athabasca river and gives you a view of the out flow.A beautiful walk with amazing sights. A great place to stop and amble through the terrain taking one's time to enjoy great scenery and informative plaques.\"Easy to get to and enjoy the thunderous roar, take your time and walk all the way around. Colours are exceptional\"\"Wonderful opportunity to go see the falls in the off season! Had an opportunity to go up to Jasper and highly recommend doing it in Oct/Nov when you pretty much have the place to yourself. Views of the Athabasca Falls and the mountains behind it were spectacular. All the mountain peaks were covered from the recent snow, but the ground down below was bare. Only a handful of people were at the falls so it was the perfect opportunity for taking pictures and enjoying the views. Being the off season, there was next to nothing for traffic coming down from Jasper on #93, so you could take your time driving to the Athabasca Falls and back. Really great destination to make for a day trip out of Edmonton and back like I did. Water was amazingly blue and the steps down to the pools below were really cool. Remember to respect the site and to pick up any garbage you bring with you. Keep it beautiful for everyone else to enjoy. :)\"\"Hey!These Falls might not be the tallest you've ever seen,or the widest,or the most forceful,but when you tie them in with their location,their backdrop and their history,you must admit they are something special.A photographers dream,do not forget your camera,well worth the visit! Be wary,because they are something else,you,ll probably find yourself in a crowd.\"The waterfall is really beautiful and the place offers a really short hike so you can access the Athabasca river for nature photography. A really good idea to stop there on the way to Jasper. Very impressive to observe how the water makes its way through the rocks!This is a beautiful little walk. The wonders of nature is incredible. The way the water has cut thru the rock over the centuries.\"amazing waterfalls, however its very crowded during summer, on our way to Athabaska Falls, lots of fossils\"\"Gorgeous, majestic, powerful. A wonderful stop along the Icefields Parkway - very well laid out so you get stunning views.\"Only 2 min walk. You get there by the time you stretch your legs out of the car parking.

I recommend everyone to visit this place\"Having checked out my list of stops to make on our two day visit to the Icefields Parkway, Athabaska Falls is difinitely at the top of my list. It is a powerful waterfall set on a gorgeous rock shelf. There is a trail and bridge that takes you to the far side of the river and gave even more great views. Not a long stop, but well worth your time.\"\"Plenty of water rushing through during melt would but very good and noisy, very pretty around falls, nice gift shop\"\"This is a must see! We did all the trails from the one that goes down to the beach below, to the one that leads up to the rapids of the falls. Spent a good 2 hours enjoying the views. An easy hike.

Informative but with plenty of time to explore this truly magnificent place it is one of the must see views.Unfortunately the falls are full of rude visitors of coaches. Although beautiful be prepared to be pushed and shoved to take a picture. My advice is to walk a bit further past the falls it's quieter and you can still get nice pics.Beautiful way to see how the whole area comes together from the glaciers to the falls to rivers. Pleasant walk along a safe walkway and great way to take amazing pictures\"Undeniably the falls are impressive. Because it is usually in the dark it is difficult to take photos of. Also it is on the main tourist coach route, so overrun by tourists.\"\"These were by far the most spectacular falls we stopped at whilst in the Rockies. You can't comprehend the amount of water flowing through & the noise is unbelievable. Really easy to wander round, so an easy walk for those less able. Would 100% recommend to anyone that they stop here! Make sure you walk all the way round to have a look from every angle though.\"We stopped here on our tour from Jasper to Banff. The falls are beautiful to lok at and the roar of the water is pretty loud. There were not many tourists about when we visited so we had plenty of time to look and take lots of photographs. There are quite a few vantage points located round about and information signs telling you about the falls.\"What an amazing place to visit . we arrived very early in the morning and it was already packed with people and blooming selfie sticks .The breathtaking beauty made the walk in the cold and crowds worth it though.It always amazes me why people run to get to the front to take a picture ,it is almost as if the water was due to be turned off at 9.30 am :-D\"\"Great parking; paths well prepared, and then the falls themselves are just superb, enhanced as everywhere by the emerald colour of the rock silt. Blown away.\"A must see when you are in the Rockies absolutely stunning. Even my 20 year old nephew was amazed at its beauty\"If you are in the area you have to stop here. While the photos are nice, being there is even more impressive.\"\"Even in the Fall, the falls are amazing- the roar of the water through the narrow channels, turning turquoise green as it flows down river.

We were making our way to Lake Louise from Jasper and our friends had planned all our stops. They said we had to see Athabasca Falls. They were right. Quite a spectacular sight. I would highly recommend stopping here and taking your time taking pictures and enjoying another great spot in Canada. O Canada. You have a lot of beautiful country!Nice views with beautiful pristine water. It was well worth the trip. We are glad that we had the chance to enjoy this place\"A really pretty area. The falls are beautiful but if you want a picture of the falls without all the people who can't read the 'dangerous - do not climb over this fence' signs, you may have to wait a while.\"Experience the power of water over time! The glacial water is so beautiful and the rock formations formed over time are beautiful. Definitely worth the stop!I have been there many of times but this time I brought my parents and daughter. It's such a beautiful spot of cysts green/blue water. It's a must stop on your way by and really only takes a good half an hour if you wanna be quick and just look at the main viewing points.\"A popular spot for sightseers but they tend to arrive by the coach load. The few spots available for photography were overwhelmed whilst we were there.Worth calling in if you are passing\"A must see! Allow lots of time here for a good stroll & many different viewing locations & photo ops.\"Beautiful falls easy to reach from the parking area , fascinating rock structures, amazing blue water\"Like all waterfalls it was awesome to watch the water cascade down the falls at a point in the year when most of the high up snow has melted can only make you want to visit again in the springtime when the water must go over the falls in torrents. Great to seeWell worth the stop and exploring this famous site. The power of the water needs to be seen ( and heard) to be believed. And this was not the falls at full flow. It's been a dry summer. What it must be like at other times of the year.A visit to the Athabasca Falls is a must see. The barriers make it safe to walk through and the rushing of the water and thunderous noise of the falls makes one feel very close to nature. Not to be missedOne of my favourite spots to visit Been there before and quite enjoyed it as last visit one you should visit\"Beautiful scenery witnessing powerful waterfalls. Great place for picture taking. Good parking area. Can be crowded so beware of times to visit - early morning or late afternoon is probably best, like most places around Jasper.\"\"The falls are stunning & really interesting, in the way they are spread around. Very different from other waterfalls we went to. The canyon that the water goes into & through, before emerging into the lake is worth the visit alone.\"Well worth the short trip from Jasper to see these falls. Enjoy a short hike around the area. It is only 30K (20 miles) from Jasper.\"As we approach the spot, the mountains and forest welcome us in quietude with swirling water flowing on the plain level. Gradually, as we descend, new dynamics gets revealed between water and rocks. The water cuts through the rocks and falls down in great speed with thunderous noise. With sun on the blue sky, rainbows appear on the spreading particles of bluish white water. The walls of rocks take amazing shapes and colours. There are View points at two levels on which visitors stand and enjoy the grandeur of Athabasca Falls.\"It was an easy stop & had handrails along the path which helps old folks like me and others on wet or icy days.\"this is one of many experiences not to be missed. stepping out on to an ice flow is weird but exciting. melting ice ,sun beating down. photographers heaven.\"\"Lots of parking, some decent pictures, water falling into a canyun through rocks, spoilt for choice in the Rockies, but definitely worth a visit\"\"Definitely worth the stop off - even though it was quite busy, the falls were stunning and the colour of the water was beautiful!\"Easy to locate- well sign posted.These falls are a must. They are loud and awe inspiring. Plenty of different views giving different pictures. The power of the water is amazing in some areas and in others it is flat and peaceful. You can spend a good 30mins just looking at the falls but there are trails to do too. Where the water is still it is a lovely blue/green colour.The walk up to the top of the falls is not flat but with a good pair of shoes and good health you will be fine- it is a proper path.These falls are a must. Very impressive. You can get very close to the top of the falls. You can also take a path to go down to the lower river level. The drive from Jasper along the icefields parkway to the falls is amazing and probably has the most amazing scenery anywhere in the rockies\"A must see, breathtaking. It's just a short drive from Jasper. The signs are very helpful and it's not that far from the road.\"\"This hike gives you a chance to view the falls from all angles, before walking down the canyon to see where it all empties out into the Athabasca River. Beautiful in any weather. Sturdy footwear is required. Our UK visitors loved this place.\"\"If you are looking to see some rushing falls, this is the place to come. The hike is a bit steep, but well worth it. We enjoyed walking the trail to see gully views as well as the falls. You are warned to stay on the path!\"\"just an hour's drive from Jasper, Athabasca Falls was a stunning treat. The new parking area at the waterfall made it very accessible and the walk paths were excellent, allowing views next-to and above the falls. The surging, spinning water has made amazing channels and formations. A not-to-missed sight!\"Had visited this area previously in the rain but this time it was clear weather and the 4 of us spent about 1 hr following the trails nearby\"The waterfall itself is not that spectacular, but the combination of the falls with the views and the colour of the water are pretty nice.\"\"short walk off the parking lot and there are numerous angles to view the natural waterfalls, rock formations and river. Well worth the time!\"\"Beautiful waterfalls, definitely worth stopping off on the Jasper to Banff route. Plenty of parking and easy to find.\"This is one place you don't want to miss when you are in the area! Beautiful falls and you won't forget this one!\"Beautiful beautiful beautifulI loved it so much and I think everyone should go and enjoy these falls\"\"The falls are only a couple of meters off the main road, so make sure to stop by. The falls themselves are quite impressive, even when rather low on water like now. There are no hiking trails around from what we could tell, so it was a rather short stop for us, 30 minutes tops\"The Athabasca Falls are between Jasper - Lake Louise on Icefield Parkway and is just a quick stop on the way.The falls are gorgeous and the landscape and scenery around is beautiful.We were lucky to get to see it during a full moon and the landscape was mesmerizing in the moonlight.Worth a stop and spending time here.\"Free parking, tourists and groomed paths. This stop is your typical waterfall stop but has been well-developed by the park and is very tourist friendly. The wide paths allow for safe and easy walking, railings for safety and occasional seating. User friendly for everyone with a beautiful scenic view of the falls.\"\"Turn onto Highway 93A and take in Athabasca Falls - they are gorgeous. Here, the river's milky blue waters funnel into a chasm and break into a creamy plume of white water with Mount Kerkeslin as a backdrop. Usually crowded, but with beauty in nature like this, who cares? Take time to enjoy the nature & go to & view Athabasca Falls.\"So many palaces to stop on the Parkway that hard to choose - would definitely include this one if you can. Spectacular!\"If you are driving south on the Icefields Parkway from Jasper, Athabasca Falls will likely be your first stop, as it is close to the town. It's a pretty but short waterfall.

Clear crystal waters - you get a sense of power\"\"Nice stop on the drive to Jasper NP. Gorgeous waterfall, easy access from parking lot, and several viewpoints. Go early or late to avoid large crowds. In addition to the waterfall, there is a nice area to explore below the main waterfall with a rock cairn beach. The water color was amazing! A must-do on any visit to Jasper!\"\"Athabasca Falls is located approximately 30 minutes south of the town of Jasper along the scenic Icefields Parkway. It is a place definitely worth stopping and exploring. There were a network of paved pathways leading to various areas overlooking the waterfalls and viewpoints of the deep and narrow canyon. Athabasca Falls was powerful and gorgeous waterfall with a stunning backdrop of forests, mountains and the river flowing through as huge volumes of water rushed down into the canyon. There were a few lookout points offering different views of the falls along the trails. I visited on a sunny afternoon and the area was quite crowded with some of the lookout areas being very small, so I had to wait my turn in order to get up front and take photos. The pathways were interesting to explore and one of them led through a narrow section between two walls of the canyon with stairs carved into the rocks. There were some great vantage points overlooking the river and the canyon to see where the water had eroded the rock to create caves and unique rock formations over many years. Athabasca Falls was a wonderful area to discover, admire the natural beauty and take plenty of photos. The parking lot was large and could accommodate quite a few vehicles. It would probably be best to visit in the morning during the summer season before the crowds of people show up. If you’re driving the Icefields Parkway, definitely stop here.\"\"On the way from Banff to Jasper, we stop over at this place for around 30 minutes~ the view is not supreme but worth to a relax short walk during long drive.\"\"I give this 4 stars only for the sheer beauty of this place. I'm sure you've all seen famous shots of the falls with a kayaker below (photo credit to Chris Burkard for that one!). The water is dazzling and the short walk down the falls to the river area is picturesque with all the little rock cairns and green forest amidst blue water. However, you are literally elbow to elbow with hundreds of tourists standing in line to get the same photo from one small spot so it felt crowded and overdone. This is NOT a hike-this is a short jaunt along mostly concrete walkways. Although there are some trails that seem to lead to nowhere along the river shore down below. There are some cool stairs carved out of the old river canyon that make a great picture if you get lucky enough that no one is coming up or down it. We had to wait for that moment for about 10 minutes. We were lucky to get some beautiful pictures but were glad to get out of that crowded place and continue on to some less trafficked hikes.\"This place only takes about 30 mins to get to from jasper and is so lovely. The waterfall is so powerful at the top and the stream so beautiful at the bottom. Easy and free to park and only a five min walk from the car parkIf driving the Icefield Parkway you must stop at the Athabaska Falls it should not be missed. The gorge and colour af the water is stunning.h\"A lovely spot to stop along the highway. There are several fairly short paths that take you to different views. There were a lot of other people there, but it wasn't excessively crowded.\"We were so taking by the breath taking views of the Falls itself. How much power the water has. Even a rainbow was sighted for a great photo opportunity. We ate our own picnic lunch therevandvit was quite busy with tourists but we did manage .\"Athabasca Falls is one of many sights to be taken in on the Icefield Parkway between Lake Louise and Jasper, Alberta, Canada. The blue green silted rivers, the glaciers, the wildlife and the gorgeous views are well worth your time. There are enough stops to keep your kids occupied and enough awe for everyone. A ride well taken.\"\"This is a beautiful spot to stop and stretch your legs. Beautiful area, and each step along the pathway provides a unique view.\"The whole area and not just the falls is beautiful. The water colour is mind blowing and add the curvy shape of the walls from the old water flow will blow your mind. Read the description panels and you will understand.\"These falls are definitely worth a stopover of 15-30 minutes. You can view them from several angles, and witness the force of the water in the small canyon below.\"\"Unlike some waterfalls we stopped at, this one offered a few things you could walk around and see how the water had shaped the rocks around it\"\"Athabasca Falls are a lovely attraction, but not very accessible for people with mobility ptoblems as there are stairs and no ramps.\"There is a large parking lot and the falls are not too far from the parking lot. The water flow of the falls is very powerful!Fascinating geology of the area creating these dramatic falls. Definitely worth the time to take the short hike to see the falls.\"Definitely a place to visit if you are staying in Jasper. Also within reasonable driving distance from Banff. Beautiful falls, easily accessed. Plenty of parking. If you have time there are a few short trails around the area or you can just follow the easy pathway around the falls.\"A very pretty falls on the way to jasper. Lots of trails and views with gorgeous mountains all around you.\"Breathtaking power of water versus rock, the falls re simply awesome, and are definitely worth a short drive from Jasper.\"The is a nice stop on the drive between Banff and Jasper. The falls were very nice and the parking was adequate. We didn't spend a lot of time here but did walk around the area to see all the different views and take pictures.\"A very nice place to visit to see the fall. The fall was not large by any means, but water flow was wild and visitors could wander along the river to several viewing spots to see the river, the fall, and the mountains around.\"\"This is one of the prime visits near town of Jasper. we went twice, it is so incredibly beautiful. a must see.\"\"This is easily located off the highway and easy to walk around.It's worth the extra 10 minutes to go down to the bottom of the river, it offers a beautiful view.\"These falls are easy to walk to and the views are well worth it. There are lots of points from which to take photographs. It is worth stopping here if you are driving from jasper to lake Louise.\"This was one of many stops on our trip through the Rockies and what a stop it was, we went early in the morning not hoping to see many people but there was already 3 bus loads there, fantastic falls and the sound s were terrific a must when in the area,\"\"Athabasca and Sunwapta fall are along the same road fairly close to each other and are must sees. The beautiful blue water cuts through solid rock making for a unique experience.These are much more developed than the little know Todd's falls.\"This is a stop well worth taking on the highway between jasper and the Columbia ice fields . Ample parking and well maintained paths lead you to an amazing waterfall and river walk.\"Pretty waterfall, pushy visitors. My fellow tourists made this place annoying instead of a place of beauty--packed with people and hard to see!\"This Falls is amazing and a must see if in the area. Walk all around for different views and photo opps. Glad we stopped to see this; just another amazing sight in the Pacific North West!This stop was worth seeing as we drove the ice fields parkway. We didn't spend too much time here but enough to see the falls and the walk down to the river.\"The Banff and Jasper area is filled with canyons like this with water carving deeper and deeper into the rock. I think Johnston and Maligne get more attention but to me, this one was the most beautiful, with the blueness of the water and the colorful canyon walls.\"Great example of power of water ln sculpting out the landscape well worth a visit on way down from Columbia icefield\"We almost drove right past but did a u-turn to see what all the fuss is about. So glad we did. This waterfall is absolutely stunning!!!! There is no long hike to get there, it is completely accessible and so worth the stop. You are free to walk along the trail to get different vantage points but the view from the main point is the best. Do not miss this on your way through.\"\"Breathtaking. Take a short walk around to see where the falls begin, where they fall into a well, and then speed through narrow canyon walls. Absolutely beautiful.\"\"Lovely Water falls to see and hear that roaring water noise , nice natural scenery with canyons. nothing much else to do but must visit\"\"Trail was easy and scenic and every step. Many, many vantage points for great photos. Able to see much in a short period of time.\"Beautiful area. Be sure to walk over the bridge and on the the other side. Even worth going down the stream to look up the canyon.\"Spectacular waterfalls that can be viewed from a variety of different platforms.It can be quite busy and we had ice /mud due to the snow the previous day but it's definitely worth a visit.Allow about 45 minutes to see it all.\"This is a wonderful sight that is close to parking that is wheel chair accessible. Don't drive through Jasper without stopping.This place was one of our highlights of our trip. We visited them twice on our trip. Beautiful pictures can be taken everwhere. Parking can be iffy as it gets buys even in September. The kids loved watching the water falls.\"The waterfalls was beautiful, but it was not as impressive as other falls in the area. You had to walk down to the falls to see the pool below the falls or you could view the falls from a bridge a short distance away. I spent a small amount of time viewing and then I was ready to move on to another site.\"\"always wanted to visit these falls, to see the view of the falls and the mountain behind them, feel the power of the falling water\"\"Thundering falls have carved out an intricate and beautiful canyon. Hike is a short, meandering walk on a paved trail which is great for children or the more physically challenged. Also, it's a great diversion after a long day on the river or more difficult trails.\"\"Athabasca Falls will always inspire you to wonder through all the canyons, walk around the lake and enjoy all the scenery surrounding the Falls. .\"We arrived on a beautiful sunny day and walk down the trail to see this roaring waterfall. Lots of nice views and picture taking opportunities. Not to be missed.\"Just plain wonderful to see and hear the falls. There is a stairway to lower falls which can be viewed at the bottom.

A good place to stop for a bit of fresh air and nature.\"Athabasca Falls are sensational with nice paved walkways to see the falls & canyons from a variety of spots.Went here on a rainy day but it was still fantastic to watch the power of the falls. It was a pity we weren't there in spring when the water levels are more fierce.\"Super easy access. Without much walk, you can see the magnificent falls from different angles including up close right by it. One hour is sufficient.\"\"Beautiful, the path is well maintained and worth going to see - you can get so close to the falls and the noise is so loud - the water is so blue\"\"We had a lot of snow the first I. September and our glacier trip was cancelled due to the length of delayed trips waiting to go, so we went up to the falls, we weren't disappointed they were beautiful. Only downside was the amount of Asians pushing people out of the way to take pictures.\"Not far outside Jasper and well worth a visit for a couple of hours or longer if you want to take one of the longer walks.We enjoyed this powerful Falls. There were plenty of places to view it and also enjoyed the canyon hike. Be sure to have comfortable hiking shoes on. We thoroughly enjoyed the beauty and power of the falls and took plenty of pictures and some video.\"Wonderful falls that are awesome to see. We allowed an hour for this stop, on the Icefields Parkway, and used every minute walking all around this fantastic spot. There are warnings about climbing over the barriers, and sad stories of people who have died when they ignored these warnings, so we were stunned to see a guy in his 20's struggling to clamber back over the barrier in a particularly dangerous spot. No photo could be worth this risk!!!!\"Very few tourists when we visited. Well maintained steps and paths and plenty of viewing platforms. Powerful falls and canyons worth seeing but not overwhelming if you have seen huka falls in n.z.It was getting near the end of the drive and we were getting a little tired I'm not sure if we wanted to stop. So glad we did as it far exceeded our expectations of the waterfalls. There are easy walks around it and is very picturesque. Tired or not is well worth stopping to see. If you're coming from the north make sure you do it.\"One of the most beautiful spots I've seen in this beautiful country of mine! Wear comfy proper walking shoes, and make sure you take a lot of photos, it's something you will never want to forget!\"You have to visit Athabasca Falls if you come to Jasper - it's why you come here!

The force was quite amazing.\"These falls are awesome and there is a good walking circuit to view these falls from many perspectives.\"Great area to see, good short walk to the area from the parking area. There is also a restaurant and bathrooms, did not use them but convient. Nice views and places to take pictures, remember your camera or cell phone and it is free.\"\"Like almost everything in Jasper/Banff, this natural wonder is breathtaking and amazing, but it extremely overcrowded. Everyone in my party loved the view of this beautiful falls and was frustrated by the excessive amount of tourists, especially those with poor etiquette of which there are many. Steel yourself and go see it.\"\"Only 32 min and less than half and hour south of Jasper, Athabasca Falls is a really impressive and photogenic sight. Although the drop of the falls at 23 metres is not particularly impressive, what hits you is the expanse of the river rushing through a small gap at the falls itself. The sound of the water is deafening. The falls is only a short walk from the car park which is just off the Icefields Parkway. There a number of viewing platforms where you can get interesting different views of the massive flow of water. You can also walk down to the bottom of the falls on a good path and view the numerous potholes that have been carved out of the rock by the flow of water.\"\"“Beautiful, but it can be deadly” The height of the falls isn’t that spectacular, but what draws you to this falls is its sure power. Loud thundering tumbling crushing cascades of water. Carving its way through hard quartzite and softer limestone, you can trace where the water changed courses leaving dry gorges and smooth potholes. This can be a dangerous place. Several people have fallen to their deaths. Do not stray from the paths.\"\"These falls are just beautiful and easily accessed. The naturally carved \"\"stairways\"\" which the rushing water created over millions of years are now very accessible via a lovely hiking trail and new bridges. There are nice rest room facilities and plentiful free parking as well. You cannot get the full experience and views from the highway or your car. But its also not a difficult walk or trek to see the falls and the eroded rock. We visit Athabaska Falls every time we come to Jasper.\"Visited Athabasca Falls during our visit to BC. Was stunning - not far to walk to see these spectacular falls. Would recommend\"We were on a tour of the Rockies , this was an amazing place to visit , views to take your breath away .\"Part of a coach your. They were beautiful to see and would recommend going to see them in either a group or independentlyAmazing to see how powerfull nature is. The falls are close to the road and there is a pad you can follow to see the waterfalls from differend sides. There are a lot of tourists because of that but still worth a visit!Well worth a half hour visit as has stunning waterfalls and water eroded pot holes great for taking pictures\"I love this place and I have to go there every time I go to Canada.Don't miss the trip down to the lakes - its breathtaking.\"It is hard to imagine the raw beauty of the falls and how powerful the flow of the water is in order to create the canyon. It has to be seen to appreciate beauty.what a beautiful area and nice walking path to see many different views of the falls. It is worth taking the time to see the entire area.\"To say that this waterfall is picturesque is an overstatement, but you will be awed by the amount of water from the river upstream gushing though the relatively narrow openings in the rocks. There is so much water that if you can too close to the nearest observation platform, you will be splashed by the fine mist whipped up by the falling water, not to mention the puddle of water collected on the floor usually mixed with mud. Nonetheless, the waterfall is interesting and is worth a visit, but other travellers consider this a must see attraction as well and the place is kind of crowded even when I visited in September.\"Nice falls. Probably my fave across banff and jasper. Very powerful! Beautiful colours. If you haven't got time for a hike you can just do a fifteen minute walk to see the falls.This is the way great waterfalls should look. Over the years water has carved a path through solid rock to a great depth.Worth it even if you only have ten minutes to spare but you could spend a lot longer. Pretty crowded though.\"Falls and rock formations were superb and seen from a path that goes up, down and all over so you get many vistas. Great for photos! If you are into it, you go down to the very bottom as well which is fun, but not really necessary for the spectacularness that the falls are...a MUST SEE.\"These falls are well worth the stop. The scenery is spectacular. Excellent spots for photographs. Must see if in the area.\"We stopped,a s does everyone, and whilst the car park was busy we managed to walk around without being in a pack and found that if we lingered the tour bus people rushed round and left pretty soon. A beautiful spot and although this isn't a Niagra experience it is very special and worth visiting.\"\"Definitely worth a visit. The falls are not huge, but the site is beautiful and the paved paths offer many perspectives from both sides of the river for viewing and photos.\"Absolutely amazing place to visit. Just beautiful. Some falls can be a little underwhelming. Not this one.\"The trail and the viewpoints are very good. The impressive amount of water can be seen from the may viewpoints. There are sufficient signs where the falls and there surroundings are explained, which makes it worthwile to walk the entire trail.\"\"Definitely worth a stop off to view these falls, 30 minutes should cover it all and has some information boards to read. Dont climb over the guard rails as people have fallen in and died from doing so\"Amazing ! Can't believe how the river has drastically changed course. Live the views as it travels thru canyonsWell worth the drive. 30 min from Jasper. Wonderful views of the falls and you can take steps down to the river.

This is a very beautiful waterfall - well worth stopping for on your travels.\"\"The carpark is very near the highway and then equally convenient to the short walk to get to these falls. A couple of foot bridges give you some great views, and you can walk under the road and down to a second platform to see the falls through the ensuing canyonOne of the highlights of my stops along the icefields parkway, I highly recommend this one\"\"This waterfall and gorge is great, the power of the water is amazing!Lots of good view points of the falls, well worth a visit. Nice walking path with a number of different viewpoints.\"\"Worth a camera stop as an intro into the Rockies. Beautiful setting.Convenient parking.easy to observe.\"\"I've seen a *lot* of waterfalls in my lifetime. It never gets old, and Athabasca Falls doesn't let you down.There are different types of falls. This one is straight up wild. It has energy. If you want to hike in a ways to see a beautiful waterfall, this one is not for you. This is a tourist stop waterfall. The views are good. Parking is easy. Access is also easy. Wheelchair friendly. Restrooms are primitive, and not the best.\"Stunning view from lots of different places. Some spots were for the able body with stairs and over hanging rocks and some views for the less able.\"We went on a tour of these falls, and really enjoyed being able to get so close to them, and to be able to walk around the falls for maximum photo ops. After some rainfall, we had lots of water to view spilling over the falls.\"\"Picture Perfect and breath taking, one of the most amazing Rock formations, Fantastic place to get some great pictures\"Fantastic waterfalls which need to secured from Japanese tourists trying to take a paddle. They spend so much time taking selfies instead of actually looking at the scenery . I doubt they even turn round . Unfortunately it was pretty packed the day we were there so it was a bit of a scrum trying to enjoy all the falls .\"Some of the most beautiful viewsWater phenomenal colors easy to get to. Close to hotel. Can get crowded\"I stop here every time I drive the icefeild parkway and I never regret it. The falls are always breathtaking.

It's a great place to visit any time of the year.\"Great to take a quick walk and get some photos. Probably gets very bust in summer, car park was nearly full in September. Good to visit en route somewhere\"\"The falls here are very strong, decent number of available parking spots on a Wednesday afternoon. Amazing rock formations made by the rushing water over the many years. This place should not be missed.\"Accessibility was easy to see these incredible falls. We took lots of pictures....loved the unusual holes made by the rushing water.love these beautiful falls but dont forget to take the fairly short hike down through the carved out rock down to the river it is spectacular !!The Athabasca Falls are a must see for us every time we are in Jasper. The constant changing water levels and colours are beautiful and unique every time we go. If the sun hits it right you can even see a rainbow from the bridge with the water spray!\"A quick drive out of Jasper to this scenic spot. You don't need a very long time here - less than an hour.Definitely walk to a few different vantage points for variety in your pics.\"\"I go here often as I live a few short hours away, very relaxing and lots of places to wonder. Free parking and most of the pathways are paved at the top.\"We saw many waterfalls during our two weeks in the Canadian Rockies but this was one of the most beautiful. Definitely make this a stop along the way!\"After walking on the Athabasca Glacier, this was an excellent stop on our way to Jasper. Absolutely beautiful! Short hike to the falls. I highly recommend making the stop.\"Very nice falls and well marked out paths that lead to various different picture sites. I would also go to the bottom and to he lake itself as can et a good picture there.\"These falls are beautiful, easily accessible, and so powerful! It gets pretty busy, especially when the tour buses are there so we went earlier in the morning. It was absolutely gorgeous!!\"\"Awesome falls, so dramatic because of the sheer volume of water crashing over. If you’re travelling the Icefield Parkway, don’t miss it.\"\"Enjoyed a short visit to these falls on our return journey back down Icefield Parkway. Easy parking and short walk to falls which are tremendous, thundering water with vapour rising. Was busy with a couple of coach parties but a short walk down a short trail to foot of falls was worth doing (very gentle steps despite warning sign!) as it was route of waterfall many yeas ago.\"In a big country with huge skylines it's easy to get a little blind to the extraordinary as it becomes mundane . This is a great stop that reminds you of the sheer power of nature .breathtaking scenery and shocking power.Roaring falls located right off the highway with various easily accessible viewpoints. The power and volume of the water was amazing. Various photo opportunitiesThe Falls are just a short walk from the parking lot. The backdrop is absolutely beautiful and the falls have an unbelievable amount of water rushing by. Be sure and take your camera.Great falls to visit - must see attraction in the Jasper National park. Take your time to enjoy the beauty of the falls. Sunset time adds a multitude of colors for your photos.\"Athabasca Falls is probably one of the best stops of Athabasca. It's a really power waterfall; probably the second most powerful falls I've seen after Niagara, of course. There's plenty to explore here and you can spend quite a bit of time here if you'd like.Upstream from here, we booked a river rapids tour, which was a lot of fun. It was just class 2 rapids, which weren't bad at all. A couple of us had been on class 3 rapids, so it was pretty gentle for us. Others hadn't been rafting before at all, and so that's why we went with this particular one. There are options to do class three rapids closer to Sunwapta. We got lucky and ended up having our own private boat with just the four of us and a guide. She did a good job explaining the surrounding areas, and of course guiding the raft itself.\"I would not say it is a must to do if you are short of time but is definitely worth it. Amazing amounts of water rushing through and carving out rocks. Not crowded but some of the pathway was slippery due to smooth rocks and water from mist. The attraction spreads over both sides of the road and you may miss it if you don't pay attention. Don't forget taking pictures while walking on the steps between layered rock formations. Also do get down to the water level where rushing water ends and wide river flows out it is a nice view from here as well.I may not take more than one hour but it is worth that time.This waterfall is quite special...not the biggest by a long way buy is one which is very interesting. The force of the water has carved some interesting shapes and canyons and indeed has caused the river course to change over time. There are some lovely photo opportunities here.The falls are a short walk from the Icefields Parkway and have interesting signs to guide the visitors.Parking lot is right there. Many interpretive signs and ample photo opportunities. Go through quickly or take your time and enjoy the beauty and power of these falls. Spring runoff would be an exciting time to visit. Came in early September so crowds were low.\"When you can't see the mountains because of the forest fire smoke, focus on the waterfalls. This is one of the two best ones. The shear force and quantity of water is amazing and the canyon that it is carved is absolutely stunning plus you can walk through the old canyons and down to the beach where you see the river become completely calm at the bottom of the falls.\"\"Beautiful day, the falls looked incredible, easy to get to and get around.......great place to have a picnic lunch\"Athabasca Falls is a pretty cool stop on your way to either Banff/Jasper along the parkway. It's a well manicured walkway which will take about 20-30 minutes and offer different views of the falls. Part of the walk includes stairways through the old path the falls used to take. It's certainly worth your time to take a quick break from driving and check it out.Nice quick stop to see some amazing falls. Good walkways and trails along the way all well maintained.\"Our trip to the Athabasca Falls was memorable. The beauty of nature was breathtaking. Got there about 4 PM and just so many people experiencing nature at its best.Great place for hiking taking pictures and just simply relaxing.A definite must.\"This is a great place to visit.it is amazing to think that all this scenery and sound was created by water.\"We spent a couple of hours here in the pouring rain. Even the rain couldn't dampen our enthusiasm, this was awesome.\"\"Amazing falls and views with a short hike. Very popular place, expect crowds. Lots of areas to explore. Paved walkways.\"I remember how much I loved this waterfall when I travelled thru the Rockies a couple of times 20 years ago in my grad school days. You know how sometimes things are not as wonderful as you remember? This waterfall is still amazing to me after all these years. Thundering water even in late summer and great vantage points that make you experience the power of the flowing water. Well worth the side trip if you love waterfalls as I do.Many viewing points for the falls. It was really beautiful! There is also a lower falls. Do not miss this as you would regret!\"If you are prepared for the hoards of others with whom you will be visiting and with waiting in line to take photos at the best photo spots, the actual falls are pretty interesting. Don't forget to hike under the highway to the lower overlook and to the river. There is a very popular photo spot from which many Instagram photos are taken, and it is hard to believe it is under a highway bridge until you've been there.\"\"The Athabasca Falls totally exceeded my expectations! The amount of water, the noise, the terrific photographic opportunity....well worth the time. We were there for about 20 minutes and frankly I could have spent an hour. If you are in the area between Jasper adn Lake Louise, please make time for this: truly wonderful.\"\"We took a Brewster Tour of Lakes and Waterfalls. Our first stop was the gorgeous Athabasca Falls. We had a little over an hour at this stop so we were able to hike up close to the falls and take some of the shorter paths to get different vistas of the area. the glacier fed falls gives the water a milky blue look. the water so so cold and yet we were there on a gorgeous July day with the sun and warm temperatures. Make sure you were good hiking shoes, you will want to walk around the area. Lots of free parking. Our tour bus was one of the first to stop in the morning so we were able to get great photos. A must see on a trip to Alberta.\"\"A humbling display of nature's ability to use the forces of water, gravity, Venturi & inertia to sculpt rock into beautiful forms over time, sensuous curves & outcropping of stone on which moss & tree still manage to cling & find a foothold. Inspires awe & wonder but also a healthy wholesome amount of fear for those wise enough to heed the park signs to stay away from the edges, respect the fence boundaries & recognize how puny we are in the face of such power.\"\"Lovely place to stop, walk down to the canyon as well as up to the top, they are only short walks and a 30 minute stop gives you time to see it all.\"\"Stopped here on our tour it was beautiful, but make sure you wear good walking shoes. There was a gentleman there selling chocolate waffles on the day, with other treats\"\"This was one of the must see spots in Jasper National Park we had to visit. This was amazing to see the falls, the canyon area and the beautiful surroundings.This takes about 30 - 45 minutes to truly enjoy. The falls and the accompanying river canyon was a true wonder. This is not too difficult of a walk but hiking shoes or a good pair of supportive shoes is recommended.There is ample free parking, and it does get busy once in awhile due to the tour buses arriving. Even with the amount of people there, we were able to get some nice photos.\"\"Just stunning - anyone who did any Physical Geography at school MUST go - really my geography teacher would have been hyperventilating! Was so excited the kids thought it was hilarious and my daughter even considered changing her GCSE options to include geography, and she does like geography. For someone from the UK who thinks High Force or Aira Force Beck is exciting this was mind blowing. You can get really close - we went early morning and on a sunny day - the light on the rock formations and turquoise water is awesome!\"\"Take a walk along this beautiful canyon and waterfall. It's a nice walk that I would not miss.Do it and you'll be rewarded.\"It was a very warm day when we visited the falls. But the spray from the falls wa refreshing and the sight breathtaking!\"Athabasca Falls were spectacular and worth the stay in Jasper.Mother nature created a wonderful sight.\"\"I was able to see the falls last month, then I went to the Alps of Switzerland in August. This compares well with anything I saw in the Alps. Switzerland has great views but this is just as wonderful\"\"Short easy hike, parking can be a challenge during high season. Be sure to walk the down river path under the road\"\"The attraction is a short walk from the car park and the views are spectacular and well worth a visit ,, We spent well over half an hour here , The falls were well attended and the walks are not strenuous at all.\"\"Well worth the stop off the highway to park up and have a little walk to see these falls. After parking, you can take one of the walks to go above the falls and then drop down to underneath the falls and see them in al their splendour.\"\"The falls are close to the parking place and enjoying the natural views is requiring no special effort and at quite a short time since it is a small natural point, unless you desire to explore more in sourroundings. I prefered the Sunwapta falls but since Athabasca falls are quite small, do not miss it as well.\"\"There are many falls in Alberta Canada and if this is something you enjoy, then you should not miss Athabasca Falls which are beautiful. We didn't get to spend as much time here as I would have liked as I'm sure there was a nice hike/walk we could have done but when there is limited time to do so many things, something has to give.\"\"Athabasca falls located of Route 93A are very beautiful. The glacial water from the Athabasca falls forms the Athabasca river which flows into the Jasper National park and ends up at the Athabasca falls where it fights with the strongest rocks in Jasper to the roaring Athabasca falls. Over time, the falls has changed as in some cases the water has won the fight with the rock and in others where the rock has stopped and channeled the flow of water. For tourists, these days we can walk in these areas. The fall itself is very beautiful and the overall tour is around 30 mins to 1.5 hours.\"Enjoyable walk and stunning views of the canyon and waterfall. We arrived early and would recommend due to parking issues\"Aside from being crazy busy with people, this is so beautiful, nice trail to walk on, paved for the main part. Then there is some dirt trail past the main part, which did have roots. There are dogs allowed, I guess, there were dogs there, which, the ones we saw were really good, but for people afraid of dogs just know they are there. Nice easy trail for anyone!\"\"Athabasca Falls is a waterfall in Jasper National Park on the upper Athabasca River, approximately 30 km south of the townsite of Jasper, Alberta, Canada\"\"Full, raging waterfall - beautiful. Nice paved trails to access the viewpoints of the falls. There are a few steps to some of the viewpoints which are not wheelchair accessible. This waterfall is easy accessible from the main highway. In my picture, you can see the main highway in the background.\"\"This waterfall, can get very busy during the day. We went around 8.30pm and it was still busy, but less so. The falls are amazing, and powerful. Well worth visiting.\"Wonderful visit to these falls and walk around the area - well worth stopping to take in this spectacular area .Right off the highway are the gorgeous turquoise water falls with path leading to several viewpoints as well as hiking trails.The title is an over used word but on this occasion the right one. The volume of water being shoe-horned into a narrow passage to cascade over the edge is enormous and so produces a boiling cauldron effect with a thunderous accompaniment. Well worth the short detour off H93.What a place!!!!! Don't miss if you're in the area beautiful you won't regret it the best falls we have seenit is a beautieful Waterfall between Banff and Jasper. we just stopped here to watch the fall. it is about 35km south of Jasper\"It is a delight to see the water cascading over the rocks.The accessability is very good though not suited for disabled people in wheelchairs.\"Falls that roar and spume spraying make this a must stop if you are in the area.Loads of parking also loads of people but lots if tours that move through quickly.Plenty of photo opportunities.These falls are easily accessed. There is good parking and the paths to the falls are okay. You don't need any real level of fitness to reach the falls and enjoy there beauty.\"Super easy to access, thunderous huge flow of water. Wonderful! The only negative is the huge volume of people as they drop busload after busload off --- try early or late. It was fun to view from multiple angles. Also, walk up the hilll by the bridge to get a good look at the lower falls and take the short walk down the canyon. One of my favorite falls.\"\"as always, wonderful to see. the best time is close to sun up, fewer tourists so you can take your time and soak it in\"Well worth the stop ... it will be a sought after and crowded spot for busses and the family photo shoots ... Look for that moment when you can take in the beauty and even get a great photo ... very powerful falls ... super viewing decks and platforms ... work your way around the side for better views ... the photos included will give you an idea of the beauty of the falls\"A wonderful place to stop and view! Easy access, great directional signage, and a natural sight that is almost breathtaking. Well worth the stop and a great photography experience. A must see!!\"\"Amazing falls, worth a visit. Good walks around. Avoid the crowds if you can help it. Nearby Edith Cavell pond is also worth a visit but you need a permit!\"\"The falls are always worth a stop. Best light is in the afternoon, which also means, more tourists. But the canyon and the stunning landscape are definitely worth it. If you are good on your feet, make sure you take the walk to the end of the canyon in the lower area of the falls on the other side of Hwy 93A (you can access this path from the general viewing area and take the path the leads underneath the bridge).\"Super place to visit. Dont miss it. Easy to access. We went with kid s and it was a great time we had thereDefinitely worth the time to visit and explore. Easy to find and there was plenty of parking space when we arrived!If you are traveling on the Trans Canada highway near Jasper you absolutely have to stop at Athabasca Falls. First the parking lot is right off the highway and the walk to the falls is very short. The trails are paved and smooth. Seeing these beautiful falls couldn't be easier and more breathtaking. There are several points from which to take photos. I suggest stopping at all of them. Nature doesn't get much better or more convenient than this.We popped in to see the falls here just on the off chance of seeing a road sign on our way to jasper. The views are great and it's only a short walk from the roadside to the falls. Lots of people will be there so you won't get lost. Nice little highlight when driving past.You must visit these beautiful falls and take the trail down the small canyon to appreciate how the falls have cut through.. Its hardly much walk for such a beautiful view.This place was amazingly beautiful and a great outdoor activity for young or old! Would definitely recommend this to anybody!\"This is a great falls. It is easy to access, offers wonderful views, and you get close enough to really appreciate the power of the falls. The railings are sturdy, and unless you (or you allow your kids) to climb over them, it is very safe. We went in fire season (Aug 17) but despite the smoke had a great time. It is a wonderful, easy to get to, and very impressive little falls.\"\"After the Columbia Icefields, stop at the Athabasca Falls. There is a short drive up to a car park which is quite small but has a fairly quick turnover. There are toilets here.A short walk down some steps and an incline brings the visitor to a viewing platform of the falls, which in late spring were still fairly fast flowing. If you have trouble getting down the slope you can still enjoy the falls from the upper viewing area. A pathway leads across a bridge where it is possible to see where the water goes to once it passes the falls. There is a small forest abutting the falls paths which provide some lovely photographs. A nice short break.\"\"A must stop off point on highway 93 the ice fields parkway. Fantastic view of land, Falls, canyon and lower lake\"Take about an hour to wander round and fully appreciate the falls. Get there before about 4pm when the sun has gone behind the trees and the photo opportunities dwindle a bit. But definitely worth having a wander round!\"Great falls, especially after rain the night before. Must stop here on the Icefields Parkway drive. Car park can be busy but it turns over fairly quickly so just need to be bit patient.\"Great to see but the crowds once a coach arrives is relentless on some of the look outs. Worth a quick stop when driving down the ice field parkway via highway 93A.\"Athabasca Falls is beautiful! It's about 17 miles south of Jasper and has many areas set up for viewing the falls, potholes, and canyon.\"\"Spectacular, magnificent etc, etc. Take the walk, get the photos. Wow. Its a must do photo stop with easy access for great photos.\"\"Stopped here on our way back to Jasper, it was very busy with tourists so I expect it would be better to visit early in the day. Impressive waterfall seeming to appear from nowhere...a few walks around the falls..and the Athabasca river is truly beautiful. Worth visiting this place if only for a hour or so.\"\"Powerful stream has carved a very deep chasm out of the rock bed, making for interesting viewing. Easy walk from the parking lot, good viewpoints created.\"It was busy being the 150 celebration of Canada but well worth it. The power of water amazes me and I love seeing these mountain canyons. Very short walk around and you can spend a little longer and walk down to the river flats after the falls.This is a crowded area of the park but worth the stop. The falls are beautiful and the area is really well maintained. This is not a strenuous hike. Anyone can manage it. We even saw strollers and wheelchairs on the paths.\"I had high expectations for this stop but, personally, I found that Maligne Canyon more impressive. There are crowds of people here and it's a little crazy. If you are expecting to get Instagram-type photos I would temper your expectations somewhat.\"Great spot to adventure the falls and the canyon! Amazing photo opportunities and super easy to get to!Did the Athabasca falls today and I loved it. Shows the sheer force of mother nature. The inukshuk's at the bottom that people made are pretty impressive as well. It is a must see for everyone passing by...even families with small children.A really great place to stop. Spectacular views of waterfalls and river. Worth stopping for the view.\"As everything around here in August, we're just way too many people 'trying' to enjoy the Jasper-Banff experience. Athabasca as all of the other super known spots are crowded....Athabasca falls are amazing but you have to be aware that you'll be sharing the amazingness with another 1000 people\"Beautiful landscape and falls. You can see how water crafted its way through mountains leaving impressive marks and potholes.Another really neat place to visit for some fantastic photos! The rock formations and the water falls are breathtaking.Take the time to stop and walk to the Athabasca Falls. Beautiful waterfall views and a great photo opportunity.\"One of many waterfalls we visited on our recent trip and to be honest they all will get 5 stars. The amount of water flowing was scary and they were just great. Lots of different views to take pictures, but none do it justice. We had no issues parking but do be aware there will be lots of people there!\"Really enjoyable and easy trail around the canyon and falls! A short drive from Jasper. worth a visit.\"Just go, you won't regret it. Basically right off the parking lot so almost no walk at all and definitely no hiking. Great for all ages and physical abilities.\"Very easy and short walk to the falls from the parking lot. Lovely picture opportunity with falls and mountain backdrop. Make sure you go till the other end of the falls - we saw lot of people just seeing it from the one end - the other end is definitely the best view of the falls.I like the hiking trail around the falls. You get several different views and great photos with the rockies as a back drop.\"The Athabasca Falls are pretty, but not the nicest in the Rockies. There is not too much parking and it was very busy during our trip.\"\"Beautiful Falls, great views. The river has formed a deep and nice canyon. Easy to park. Near Jasper. A have-to-see location.\"\"We were on a Tauck tour group going from Lake Louise to Jasper and stopped for a photo op at Athabasca Falls. Well worth seeing. I never get tired of seeing water falls. There were several lookout points all worth pictures.I would definitely recommend.\"\"This is a very popular place for visitors of all ages. The Waterfalls covers quite a large compound. When visiting here, do go around the other side of the Falls. Depending on the sunlight, you may catch the sight of rainbow at the other bank of the Falls.\"We arrived at Athabasca Falls (17 June) and the carpark was already filling up- busses too. The falls were fabulous and just a short walk to continue onto the canyon and the River. Most rivers were in flood during our visit so all the falls were spectacular.Worth a visit....stunning water falls.... amazing to see the force of water . There is parking . Just be bear aware !\"We stopped by on our drive from Banff to Jasper. Very close to Jasper , easily accessible. Before stopping here, we stopped at Sunwapta Waterfalls (Sunwapta means turbulent river). Well Athabasca falls is not only turbulent and torrential - its ferocious. This is a \"\"must do\"\" - the power of the water just blew me away. Its a \"\"wow\"\" !\"A must see stop along the way! Beautiful falls and easy to access of highway! Lots of paths to view the falls and area with easy navigation with small children.It is a mini Niagara Falls but surrounded by mountains. Easy to walk and view. There are several viewing platforms. Even the rocks with lichens were interesting.\"This is a must see if your in Jasper, it's amazing on how the water has shaped the rocks ??it's amazing the color and how fast the water moves, there is always a lot of people but it worth seeing!!\"\"We happened upon the road sign for Athabasca Falls and decided to see what it was all about! Wow! There had been some recent rain and the Falls was really roaring.Very picturesque and took lots of photos. Pretty crowded but well worth the stop.\"The falls are spectacular and landscape amazing. We were staying in Jasper and made it a day trip going to Mount Edith Cavell first and then on to Athabasca Falls. Definitely worth the visit. Plenty of parking and it's a nice drive on from Mount Edith Cavell instead of taking the highway.\"wonderful day to visit natures beauty. must see easy to get to, just minutes away from Jasper and it's free\"\"Just steps from the main road, don't miss the opportunity to walk to this hidden gem and experience an unexpected but delightful waterfall!\"\"This is a mini Niagara Falls. Fun to explore. Hidden but attracts crowds. Favorite for bus tours. 45 minutes to one hour is plenty to time to allow to see this, depending upon parking.\"really worth walking down to see the falls views over the hills and mountains are amazing. You can visit this on your way through to Jasper if you are drivingWell worth the stop. Beautiful falls with many lookout points. Very short walk to falls with good paved pathViews are stunning. It's a waterfall having different colors in different seasons. My visit was summer and the water is like silver white. It's a great visit and worth a drive into it. Highly recommend it if you're in Jasper AB. Location is easy to find too.The sheer power of the falls and river is breathtaking. The noise makes you sit and take stock of how powerfull mother nature is.\"Travelers have generally seen many waterfalls, but this one is worth the trip. There is far more water than in many mountain falls and the observation areas are excitingly close to the rushing water. There isn't anything else here, really, except some non-flush washrooms, but this is a memorable stop on a journey.\"Must see stop. Take the short walk at the lookout stop. Beautiful views. Get there early. Can be crowded in the summer\"Not a big fall. Great scenery. close to the road, and worth a stop to see it. Parking is convenient, not a long walk.\"We spent about a half hour here. Impressive views of the power of water eroding rock the Mist and thunder of the water made a great experience.One of the highlights of our trip. The power of the falls is amazing. Walk to the falls is flat but need to take stairs to see the river belowThis was our favorite falls along our drive up to Jasper and a beautiful walk along the slot canyons to view the files from different angles was enjoyable.\"Can get a little busy but a nice waterfall with some good viewpoints, pick the right time of day for the best light\"Getting to the falls was easy. What wasn't easy was trying to get onto the walkways for a picture. There were so many people. It was right in August when we went to the falls so that is to be expected. The photos you can take are worth the wait for others to move on. There is lots of parking but when we arrived there was only a few spots left. I suggest you go early in the day rather than later afternoon.Great walk with spectacular scenery. Lots of beautiful photo opportunities along the way. Easy walking.This is literally steps from a very ample car park so it is a popular stop for everyone including tour buses and it's very crowded. This also makes it difficult for photo opportunities as you will always have crowds in your shots but it shouldn't be missed. There are lots of little walks to explore the area and a lot of interesting information for geology buffs. The falls are amazing so you can't blame so many people wanting to view them.\"My lady and I share a hobby that takes us to many places, some mundane, some spectacular, and many in between. This resides in the spectacular.We arrived about mid-day and were lucky to find a non-parking lot parking spot. The weather was hot and sunny. Despite the crowds, we were able to see all of the advertised views albeit with some patience. We had been here a few years ago, but it was rainy and cold, and we didn't stay long. This time we stayed about half an hour and were able to take our time seeing everything we wanted to.I definitely recommend this attraction.\"A fine waterfall if you are interested in this sort of thing. Easy to access and you get up close and personal with the power of the water. Lots of toilets in the parking area.\"Athabasca Falls is beautiful, easy to access and worth your time if you are near Jasper. It's much closer to Jasper than the Athabasca Glacier. You will be glad you stopped to see this gem.\"\"Not the tallest falls I have ever seen, but very beautiful sorroundings. Nice pathways leading to the falls. Parking near by.\"This is a great place to stop and look around. Trails are easy to walk on and views are fantastic We took lots of pictures and saw both upper and lower views.Easily accessible from the car park. Worth stopping off to see. The paths are easy for people with limited mobility to get around. Lots of bus trips seem to stop there.\"This was very beautiful and it is hard to describe the rush of the water that has carved through the rock over the years. It was fairly crowded but we enjoyed it anyways. As many other sights, this is close to the road and not a long hike to get there. Part of the beauty of the nature at the Canadian rockies. Don't skip it.\"\"Anthabasca Falls are a short 50 ft walk from the parking lot, and very close to 93A and 93 (HWY 1) intersection. Our two girls - 12 and 16, really enjoyed the views. Anthabasca Falls are very impressive, the views are exhilarating, and you can truly admire nature's strength here. Be sure to bring your camera, and snap some pictures, as you walk leisurely for 15-20 minutes (there are many angles where you can capture the falls). Highly Recommended!\"\"When traveling through Jasper Park to Golden we stopped at the falls. It was quite busy that afternoon but we managed to find a parking spot in the large parking area. It was a short paved walk to the falls, wheelchair accessible, and I was able to set up the camera for a couple of good pics. There were clean washrooms on site and it only takes about 30 minutes to capture the essence of the falls. Worth a stop on your trip.\"\"On our way from Banff to Jasper (the most picturesque drive we have done so far), we stopped to hike the easy trail to see the falls - there were simply breathtaking! There was a gorgeous view pretty much every turn we made. It was also a dream-come-true for geography buffs - make sure you stop and read the plaques to learn the history of this amazing landscape.\"As with pretty much all sights in this area walk a little way and you escape the crowds and can be soon on your own. The falls were spectacular. The sheer volume of water and ferocity of them was really quite frightening. A good trip. On way back to Jasper we stopped at Horse Shoe lake which was probably nicer in my opinion. Emerald waters a bit of a clamber in places but deserted. It was stunningly lovelySuper easy visit and not a big time commitment. Great vista and video opportunity with the strength of the falls.We made sure that we arrived at the Falls early on the morning to avoid the crowdsThe Falls are very beautiful and we took many photos from the different places around themThe remarkable geology of the area is remarkable and the sound and spray from the Falls with the high mountains behind them and beautiful trees are hard to beat\"Great stop at the side of the road. Just moments to get to the falls and well worth the stop. Even if you have a husband that doesn't like to stop, make him because you'll all love it!\"Beautiful & majestic place to see off Icefield parkway. A 20 min drive from Jasper town. Parking could be limited but you could wait for an available spot as people tends to spend an average of 1/2 hour in this place.\"Many of the falls visited within the Banff and Jasper National Parks are viewed from the bottom of the falls rather than the top, unless you are happy to hike to the top. Athabasca falls are different in that the walk initially leads you to the top of the falls. It is the sheer volume of water crashing over the falls that makes them spectacular. Go and see them. You won't be disappointed.\"\"Impressive waterfalls, but was really crowded with tourists. One can walk to various levels of the water. Free of charge.\"\"We stopped to see the falls on a Cross Canada road trip and were very impressed. We appreciated the picture taking opportunity but more important, we appreciated learning about how the Athabasca river flows to the Arctic Ocean. This attraction is well worth the time to visit—The walk is easy and there are plenty of benches for resting if needed.\"\"The falls are a great photo opportunity any time of the year. The amount of water spilling over the falls varies a great deal. Spring, summer and fall pictures will look very different.\"\"The waterfalls are beautiful and it's only a very short walk from the parking lot so easy to visit. Nice trip if you still have some time left, you'll be in and out within an hour\"Worth a stop to check out these falling. Lots of people as you would expect but you can take different path to get some peace and quiet\"This waterfall was deceiving. It didn't look like much until you got up to the actual fall lookout. Once there, they were much more impressive.\"\"The falls and surrounding scenery are beautiful, but be prepared for the walk up the trail. Wear athletic shoes with good tread, and if you have walking poles you should bring them. It is crowded in August.\"Absolutely stunning place to stop off. Go down to the river too and get some amazing pics on the rocksOne of the coolest sights on the way from Banff to Jasper. Very beautiful! One of the best photo spots on our trip.\"Another outstanding feature of the Jasper/Banff glory. But it can get really crowded, parking isn't easy and the viewing area is small.\"\"It's like a miniature of Niagara falls. Plenty places to take pictures.It's not too far from Jasper.\"\"The falls, like the rest of Canada were fabulous. Not as big as I imagined but amazing nonetheless. Short enough walk to get to the falls so would definitely recommend as a stop off point!\"\"Easy to get to, and worth the stop. Views were amazing. I would suggest anyone travelling to make the stop.\"\"We were on a mission to see Wells Gray Provencal Park, Banff NP, Jasper and Glacier NP . While Glacier NP has a special place in memories Jasper NP is trully a diamond! Loved the Northern most part of the park and Athabasca Falls was amazing.\"Went here as partbof a bus tour. Just another waterfall. Worth a look but the crowds are ridiculous. You have to push through the crowds to get a photo. Would be ok if not too crowded.\"You don't go there expecting big waterfalls, but for seeing the natural beauties along Icefields Parkway and it is certainly worth visiting.\"Very scenic. Take the time to explore the whole area and get an idea of how this area has evolved over time. Great photo ops. WATCH YOUR CHILDRENThis was an easy to walk trail but absolutely stunning! Very unusual rock formations with the rushing water! Highly recommend!This is a must see for every family vacation! You can easily spend an hour here. Absolutely beautiful place.The falls were amazing and with the bridge that goes over it you can see it from many angles. Well worth the visit. About a 20-30 minute drive from downtown Japer. Get there early as it is popular and parking is limited. We arrived at 11:00 am an got one of the last few spaces although people are coming and going all day.\"The beauty of these falls is amazing, especially if you had the opportunity to go rafting on another portion of this river...\"\"If you want to be close up to a water fall this is the place,you can see it from every angle and when the sun is out the rain bows are fantastic.We have some great videos,warning you can get wet as well but that's the fun that comes with the trip.\"We traveled from Lake Louise to Jasper National Park on day 6 of our Tauck Tour of the Canadian Rockies and our guide Rob had us stop & visit the Magnificent Ahabasca Falls. They were absolutely spectacular with waterfalls & beauty abound! A must visit to this Magnificent site! Don't miss it!??\"Took the 93A and arrived at the back entrance and wandered around all the viewpoints that allowed you to view the torrent of water pouring through these small gaps in the rock! Nicely done walkways, bridge, viewing points, access canyons along old water courses to view from different angles! Enjoyed being so close to power of the river and nature!\"Great visit. Lovely views. Well wothe stop and the short walk to the falls. Very popular of course so there was a bit of jostling with the crowds. But this didn't detract from the visit. Highly recommend.\"They said it's the largest fall in Jasper/Banff area. It's right beside 93A, convenient. Just stop and take some picture, then leave. Definitely worthwhile to go.\"Enjoyed in the morning on our way from Jasper to Columbia Icefields. little chilly in the cloudy morning.\"A lovely walk that took a little under an hour (with a lot of stops to appreciate the views and take photos). The power and beauty of the Falls and the tranquility of the river beyond it were incredible. There were quite a few people there, but it did not feel crowded because there were so many viewpoints. I would recommend going down to the beach area beside the river, even though the steps are steep. There were some interesting information boards around the pathways and the option to walk further through the woods. Would not recommend the toilets - they are long drops, were filthy and really stank!\"What an unreal place - like being inside a picture postcard. Several places you can walk to and get great views of the falls!Great waterfall. This was our third visit and we have enjoyed it each time. The power of the river is impressive as it courses down the falls.A must when you are in the area. The sound and the beauty of these falls are carved in stones. Few from several vantage points to get the full effect of glacier melts.\"This location has easy access to a remarkable falls where one can walk across a bridge over the Falls and see down into the area below. The path on the other side of the bridge allows you to see the upper area rapids before the Falls and the lower area of the Falls, It also has a walking trail on both sides of the Falls. It is very safe to view and hearing the sound of the Falls is a treat as well. It is really worth the stop to see and I am sure you will get some great pictures for your album.\"\"These falls do not have a huge vertical drop, but you see the power of the water at work and the walls of the canyons are beautiful. The toppers are the signs. They are written with a verve you rarely see at parks and recount the dangers of the falls and the constant war between water and rock. One of the best stops on the Icefields Parkway.\"Athabasca Falls should be on your list of places to visit in the Icefields-Jasper area. Short walk from parking and you get close to the water. There are several hikes available around this area and it's common to see a rainbow around the water falls.\"Worth the visit. Definitely photo worthy.Not all of the site is disabled accessible (even the main parts).\"\"This is really cool. The fencing keeps you a little too far away but there are multiple viewing spots. Like most of the really neat things to see, parking is limited and its not setup to handle a lot of people. Didnt see any parks staff either. Still you shouldnt miss itI even got a cool shot with a rainbow\"Not quite Niagara but still worth a visit. Easy to walk around and you can go to a further viewing point if you want. Good restaurant and gift shop.You can just sit there and marvel at the amount of water from this big river getting funneled into this little neck. Sad reading about all the idiots who got too close and fell in and died. Beautiful spotEasy access we just parked side of road and walked to bridge. Beautiful spot to stop and appreciate mother nature.Not to far out of Jasper is the perfect spot to go for a short hike and amazing views. Recommend going first thing in the morning before it gets too busy with tour buses.\"The easiest and most convenient attraction to hit during a week in Alberta. Not far from parking and no hills, paved paths, and just lovely.\"This is a beautiful little hike to visit the Falls which are wonderful to experience. We shared the experience with our friends and took lots of pictures.This place is a must to visit if you are in the area. The falls and views are simply breathtaking and spectacular. Worth walking out to some of the more distant viewing platforms to see the falls - you won't be disappointed. I'll remember the views for a long time to come.\"Highly recommend going to Athabasca Falls when visiting either Banff or Jasper. It's free, plenty of parking and lots of great vistas to enjoy for solo, couples or families. Great for photos.\"A powerful waterfall that has great viewpoints near the parking lot. This isn't a hike but rather a pull off to check out. It's worth a visit if you have some time to kill.Surprised at how close you can get to this relatively small but nonetheless beautiful and powerful fall. The fall can be viwed from both sides and from above. Impressed by the way these various aspects are managed via fencing and signage. Apparently there are serious accidents and deaths when people have ignored these.\"We did a quick stop at the Athabasca falls on our way south. Although it can be busy it is worth the stop. The falls are spectacular.It is easy to get around and the place is well maintained.\"\"This is an easy stop along the way and worth 20-30 minutes. It won't be peaceful - there are lots and lots of people at this spot, but the falls are spectacular.\"Can be a bit crowed when the bus tours come in but worth the visit. There are washrooms in the park lot which can be handy. Take a jacket as the spray from the falls can make it a little cool even on a hot day.\"Great view of the falls, quite busy so best to go early in the day or late in the day, good place to stop, eat lunch and enjoy the view down by the water\"A bit of a honeypot but well worth the easy walk. The falls are just amazing. Safe due to good paths and fences.\"A great 10 minute stop to stretch your legs. It is a gorgeous place, but don't expect tranquility - Because it involves very little walking, tour buses are unloading here all day so the crowds take away some of the natural beauty of the place. In the summer time, don't expect to get a parking space between 12pm-5pm. Aim to go early in the morning or at sunset.\"\"These waterfalls were truly a memorable part of our journey to Jasper, with multiple streams and a beautiful picture-postcard view. Keep in mind it is a very busy attraction and thus very popular with tourists so be prepared to squish in among a crowd if attending during popular times! Note there are several vantage viewpoints to see the falls.For the absolute best pictures with your digital camera, figure out how to set a longer shutter speed. Between 0.25 to 0.5 second generally gives me the best results. Generally speaking, the slower the waterfalls, the longer shutter speed should be to give the nice soft effect of water movement. With very aggressive falls, shorten your shutter speed; in some cases where the flow is very aggressive, it will show up all white, so bear that in mind.Please kindly indicate if you found this review to be helpful as it will allow me to better focus my future efforts! Much appreciated - hope you have a great time and safe travels!\"Six adults and two young children hiked around the well marked trails to view the awesome falls. The trails are safe and designed for people with a variety of abilities. Lots of parking spots were available as well as bathrooms.This was a super crowded venue that was less impressive than expected. We would recommend continuing further into Jasper to Maligne Canyon! So amazing!Just a short walk from parking lot to this awesome sight! You need only a short stop but so worth it! Spectacular!Definitely worth a stop! Very crowded - best to visit early or late in the day. Many great views of the falls. Allow 30 min.\"Nothing ruins a great day in nature like 500 people fighting for the same parking spot. The falls themselves were incredibly powerful. There are paved paths to get you from the parking lot ( or road) to and around the falls. No hills to climb, lots of guard rails and warning signs - not that common sense is in short supply. Many huge rock formations and overhangs in the falls that make for great pictures. Expect to line up to get the shot you want. Too many people in a small place for me. But you should still stop here\"\"A short trail walk to the falls. Hard to imagine all that water going over the falls.Go early to get good photos by yourself\"\"This is a beautiful setting and a scenic place to stop. The falls are in more of a canyon, so overlooks are small and very overcrowded. Worth the stop, just be prepared during high season.\"\"This falls is beautiful and worth the short hike. It is very crowded, but that doesn't seem to detract from the beauty.\"\"Athabaska Falls is a wonderful nearby attraction from Jasper, Alberta. We are glad we stopped by and explore the trails which offered even better views of the falls. Definitely well worth the stop.\"\"These are a wonderful set of falls, with tremendous views. But it can get very crowded. Try to get there early (before 11:00), and before the numerous bus tours arrive. Well worth a visit.\"\"Apart from the sheer physical majesty of the place it is so well signed and explained by the information on site that one cannot help but be impressed. This is why I came to Canada. It is so much more than \"\"ahsum\"\".\"\"One must stop and view the falls...no matter how limited on time. It is not only beautiful, but also a wonderful example of the pure power of nature. If one is a photographer there are many locations to take that \"\"one shot\"\" of the trip. If you are a hiker, there are plenty of footpaths that allow one to meander among the woods and river/falls. The best locations for viewing are, understandably, crowded. However, people seems to recognize that everyone would like to have that special \"\"vantage\"\" point view and are courteous with their time at those locations. Small childres should not be left unattended or unsupervised, however. There are locations along the trails where one might get too close to the waters and could potentially slip and fall. That said, it is too beautiful and powerful to miss.\"\"Pretty incredible sight. Great trails to walk down and see all there is. Take lots of pictures, walk down to the ricer and put your feet in the cold water.\"\"Athabasca Falls are a great stop between Jasper and Banff. If you are not a hiker, but want to enjoy beautiful falls this is the perfect place to go. There are walkways all around the area, scenic views, and nice photo opportunities. It is busy in July and August, but still a quick and easy way to close to beautiful falls.\"Stopped of here as a part of our tour and they were a great sight part of Canada's wonderfully scenery.\"This is the second time that I have been to Athabasca Falls and I could hardly wait to show my Husband and friends what I had seen before. The Wow factor of these falls just takes your breath away, I would recommend that anyone that is in the area to stop by and see this beautiful Gem.\"The falls were gorgeous and an easy walk to get to in order to see. One of the best falls to see in Jasper National ParkWe made a quick stop in the afternoon at Athabasca Falls. The falls are close to the parking area. The falls have cut a very interesting rock formation.\"Athabasca Falls offers a beautiful view of the falls and an adjoining canyon. This is a busy spot so it is best to go early in the morning or later in the day. This is a great spot for photos, offering good views of the mountains as well.\"Excellent walkways and scenic spots to capture the beauty of the falls. Signage provides explanations about the falls.This is an easy to reach waterfall which has many different viewpoints for photos. It is huge and powerful - compared to any other falls we saw in Banff and Jasper National Parks. A must-see.\"Roaring churning intensely powerful falls. A good walkway through. Worth a stop.There are steps, may not be ideal for wheelchair users.\"\"The force of the water as it thunders down is really quite amazing.Follow the walkway to the various vantage points in order to appreciate how the water has carved into the rock.Information boards tell the story.\"\"Nice small walk with lots of info on the falls and paved paths. Just like other waterfalls it was just a lot of white water flowing over rock!! It is interesting though seeing the formations in the rock, imagining how hard the water hits the rocks. It's is a nice quick thing to do, not something you'd want to run into while kayaking!!\"This was a very cool waterfall and more unique than traditional falls. There is a well paved walkway with three look outs. Can be a bit crowded... but this is a must see. There are some non crowded trails that run behind the falls that may be worth a look.\"Athabasca Falls are always beautiful to visit. The scenery, the power of the water, the deep, abandoned channels, the cool spray on a hot day ... the only thing that detracts from all this are the hoards of people. Feels like Disneyland at Christmas time! Wouldn't be so bad if there weren't so many stupid, oblivious people who think they are the only ones on the planet! But I digress (because there are those people everywhere). Given that, I would still highly recommend visiting the Falls - a not-to-be-missed sight along the stunning Icefields Parkway.\"We visited Athabasca Falls in early July 2017 - beautiful falls with multiple viewpoints; You could do a half-a-day trip from Jasper or do a pit-stop on Icefields Parkway prior to arriving into Jasper (Assuming you are driving from Banff)\"Simply beyond words, a must see. Beautiful and stunning waterfalls. Let nature speak to you. Go as early as you before crowds arrive.\"When driving to Jasper along the Glacier Parkway you pass the falls so may as well stop and have a look. Good views and only a short walk from the car park. Longer walks if you want them. Good photo opportunities.Easy to get to from the parking lot but equally as interesting drive to get to the falls off of the main highway. We had not seen many animals prior to this particular day and we saw 4 bears driving along 93A!The amount of water is truly impressive. There are a variety of areas to walk around and get different views of the falls and surroundings. Take your time and explore a bit to see the other elements of the landscape.\"This is an old park that is not well maintained, but the falls are outstanding. It's amazing how water can carve through stone.\"\"An amazing display of God's majesty. Some steps to maneuver, but a very well constructed walk. A must see, if going to by driving by Jasper.\"\"You can see the falls from various view points . Recommend you hike to all of themChildren have a great time\"Pretty place easy to get too plenty of parking lots of tourest in June o well we are all tourists soke where\"We stopped on a whim, passing by on our way from the Columbia Icefield. it was totally worth it - the hardest part was to find parking! This can be a super short visit (we were only there 10 - 15 minutes), or you could bring a picnic and explore a bit more. Highly recommended!\"Awesome waterfall with easy access. There are some stairs but it is worth the time. You will need about 30-45 minutes if you want to stop at every view point on the trail. Not very busy when we arrived late afternoon!\"This was quite an amazing visit. You witness the power of the water and how it erodes the rock. Take the time to walk down to the bridges, it is well worth doing. Stunning views.\"This was a 'chance' stop on the highway - that I'm so glad I made. It was beautiful - and the information about the origins and the flow of the Falls was wonderful.\"Stunning falls. Would thoroughly recommend that you walk all the way down to the 5th bridge. Its not too tough. The signage is a bit confusing. But its quite simple. Follow \"\"7\"\" down to 5th bridge and then follow \"\"7f\"\" back to the car pArk. Enjoy!\"We travelled from Jasper to Banff and stopped to see the Athabasca Falls. It is a short drive from Jasper. The falls in summer are spectacular. Rushing water into a canyon. powerful falls. A well maintained site and good pathways. Well worth the visit\"What a fabulous place to visit / lovely walk., stunning sceneryA must visit for all ages and levels of fitness\"\"Get ready to take lots of pictures. The falls, river, and rock formations are great. Be prepared to spend about 30 minutes just looking and enjoying the scenery.\"\"A short walk to an amazing slice in the earth! Take time to walk to the bottom, your many steps will be rewarded.\"\"They are currently building a new bridge, so some access points are blocked, but this was very cool to see. Gets you out of the car and a beauty view for a few minutes, so it was work the stop!\"\"One of the must do's when visiting Jasper National Park - very nice falls, quite easily accessible after a small (not difficult) hike.\"\"Definitely worth the stop. It was nice to see the falls from several different locations and to go to the bottom and walk into the water. The parking is limited, but plenty of room along the road.\"What a wonder of creation is Athabasca Falls. We loved the raw power of the rushing water over the rock. It was very crowded as there was a tour bus there at the same time as us. We walked along the paths and when we got back to the falls they had gone so it was much more pleasant to see. Definitely worth seeing.Enjoy the vista of the water running and swirling as it passes thru crevices in rocks bouncing off walls.The stunning aquamarine water rushing and tumbling into the river gorge is a glorious sight. It's a short hike from a roadside parking spot and seems quite accessible for most visitors.Was a beautiful hike and didn't feel over crowed at all. We really enjoyed both the hike and the falls!Falls are so close to the road you really need to stop. Short path to the falls with nice vistas to see then. Take a rain jacket.Such a fantastic place the noise of the falls is very dramatic it has 6 bridges only got to 5 as it was very steep & such a hot day I just could not make it to no. 6Worth a visit particularly early summer following the glacial melt as amount of water coming down the falls is amazing.\"Great easy stop on the road between Banff and jasper. Seems to be less popular than some of the other stops (sunwapta falls, Peyto lake) so a good place to take in some gorgeous scenery without huge crowds. Very easy and short walk down to the falls which are spectacular. Beautiful forest surrounding the falls too.\"Good to visit. 30 minutes required at most. Try the 93A route from along route 93 to make a circular tour from Jasper. Quite a bit of wildlife on the quieter 93A road.\"Visiting Athabasca Falls is highly recommended. The views were awesome and I greatly enjoyed my stay at this location.Beautiful and stunning.Highly recommended.\"There was sufficient parking. The walk to the falls is easy and they are really fantastic. The force of the water is awesome.\"Great views from several platforms and viewing areas. Parking is a bit hectic as it seems like on the road is the only option, however there is an off-road area, so look for that.\"\"There are so many other places to go, waterfalls to see, hiking options ... Athabasca Falls seems designed for tourists who want to walk a couple of steps, take a photo and leave. We thought it was totally overrated and enjoyed many other places in the area a lot more.\"Beautiful setting. The waterfalls were well worth visiting. Easy walk to the main viewing area. Other longer walks along the river also easily accessible.\"We had the falls almost to ourselves for an hour, caught the sun bursting over the mountains, and were able to go all around the falls and go down to the river before the invasion of busses of tourists.\"Lovely place to stroll along the trails and see the falls from different view points. It can get crowed.Beautiful fall. At this time waters were high which made the fall of the waters stronger. There are a parking lot and washrooms. Be aware that this a touristic place snd it is always full of people visiting.Has to be experienced if you come to Jasper....can spend as little as 20 mins there or as long as you like. Not many facilities other than toilets....and there are a lot of steps on part of the route.\"You will not be disappointed, these water falls are breathtaking and very much a great photo opportunity\"\"We stopped at Athabasca Falls on our way back to Canmore from Jasper. Well worth the time! It's a very short drive off the parkway to a large parking lot w/ plenty of washrooms. You can hear the falls well before you can see them. We've visited Niagara falls a few times and of course they aren't as that tall but what makes Athabasca so special is how close you can get to them to feel the mist and of course, the beautiful mountains behind them. Depending on what time of day you're there, you can catch a rainbow in the mist. We love it there.\"A waterfall with many walks in the surrounding area and also river rafts below falls. Good facilities in car park. Falls are impressive and thunderous and you may catch a rainbow in the spray from the waters.Our friends took my wife and I to Athabasca Falls. I had never been before but was very impressed. The area is great for taking photos. I can't wait to come back again. Parking is easy. For taking pictures of the falls it is better after about 1:00 so the sun is not in you face.\"Despite being very busy this time of year,it is quite a sight.Impressive and majestic! The way water carved its way!\"\"Do not miss these falls. Incredible !!We are telling you.... do not miss it !!Take the entire family and witness Mother Naturedoing her work, effortlessly.\"Beautiful falls & easy walking though some uneven footpaths &steps you can walk back to where you started in about 20 minutes but make sure you see the lake to it's not just a place with a waterfall.This fall is really worth a visit. The view is spectacular and the formation of the rocks and water is breath taking. It is an easy walk through the first fall but I understand you can spend quite a while if you want to see them all. Take care with the smooth surface of rocks when you walk. It can be quite slippery.\"These impressive waterfalls are not too far from the car park (for a young child who was with us). Although reasonably short in height, the falls had terrific volumes on the day we visited, creating good spray and noise. The really good things is that the water continues down through a canyon cut out by the water over ages, and continues to impress as it heads downwards. Well worth a visit!\"\"These fall were great for a quick stop between Jasper and the Icefields. We whitewater rafted from the bottom of the falls the day before, so it was nice to see the view from the top!\"Only a short distance off the highway. Breathtaking falls through narrow cuts in rock with many scenic overlooks.\"Saw pics online and couldn't wait to see for myself. Sort of a 'canned' experience, with trails that are paved, giving the feeling of being at a theme park.\"\"The river has cut down 60 feet or so through the limestone. the signs warn you about the dangers of approaching the edge and the gorge is steep and the waters rush though, worth seeing.\"\"As you are starting toward the Columbia Ice Field from Jasper, don't miss these beautiful falls. Several different views and they are all gorgeous. For maximum effect take a video with the roar of the falls complimenting their wonder\"\"A short walk from the parking lot brought you right to the falls.Stopped here on way back rom Mt. Edith Cavel\"Beautiful falls just off the road but very crowded. Saw a rainbow! Easy paths to walk and see the falls from every angle. No services. Lovely\"Easy to do from the road, can be a quick stop. Definitely worth stopping for between Lake Lousie and Jasper\"\"A must see except during low water in autumn and winter. The waterfall, slot canyon and the mountain beyond is quite photogenic. Be ready for major crowds.\"\"The Falls were easily accessed from highway 93 or 93A.It was a spectacular sight. We first saw the upper part with roaring white currents. The resulting mist was cold and refreshing. We followed the trail to the lower section where there was no water. The pothole showed the power of water carving the rock. The river was a starting point for whitewater rafting. Along with snow mountains in the distance, spruce trees along the river, the view was breathtaking.\"\"We've seen Athabasca Falls countless times, as we show it to every visitor who visits us in Canada. Every time it's different, especially the beach by the river. This time the water was so high that there was hardly any beach visible. One time the beach was filled with inukshuks that people built out of the stones on the beach. It's always gorgeous.\"\"By the time we visited Athabasca Falls, it's the 5th day of our trip to Banff/Jasper. The excitement to see amazing color of the lake/falls was wearing thin, but this fall is still very much worth seeing. There is a little walkway and viewing platform for you to have better view (if you don't mind getting wet). I have been to a few places (Iceland for one) and this fall is def. one of the best.\"The power of water is unimaginable! But you can see it at work in Athabasca Falls. There is a fairly easy walk featuring various viewpoints and features of the falls. We were in awe of the massive amounts of water pouring over the falls and the features that the water had carved into the rocks.\"See how the water forms the environment, a short and impressive walk.... even though you will meet a lot of people during the vacation time....\"We came here having stopped en-route to Jasper and OH MY GOD! This place is just full of foreign tourists which makes it extremely difficult to navigate and get around. We did enjoy the sights and taking pictures and there is lots of parking.\"A great trail for stretching your legs, and taking in some beautiful sights. The trail is well maintained with several viewing areas. Can really get crowed with tourist, but well worth seeing.\"\"Not tall, but powerfull and beautiful waterfall. It is worth the stop for sure. Easily accessible for older folks.\"\"This was one of our last stops on our road trip that day from Lake Louise to Jasper, but well worth stopping for. Its a large and powerful waterfall which you can see from many angles and can get very close to. The old gorge with steep steps is also very impressive and the views at the bottom are stunning. Definitely a must see place\"one of several falls/canyons in the Canadian Rockies that must be near the top of most must-see lists. it was not too much walking and lots of nice views. the information boards were good and the path was in pretty decent shape.\"We drove the whole way from Banff to Hinton in a day, and we saw a LOT, but Athabasca falls really stands out as the top attraction. I've seen a lot of waterfalls, from Niagara to the Lower Falls of the Yellowstone and many others. This is truly one of my favorites.\"\"Beautiful falls, easy to find and an easy walk to see the falls. Several different walk options, from very short (200m) to longer walks if the mood strikes. Recommend stopping in to see.\"Quite a nice short experience. Lovely falls and good education on its history. Good location for picks and a stop to break the drive from Jasper to Banff. We loved the rainbows as well. You can walk to the bottom to see the river as well.Fantastic place to visit. This was a great place to go on a rainy day. I touted it to my spouse who had never been there before. Awesome.We went here for some exercise and the scenery. The views at all the bridges are very interesting. The power of water is nature.We stopped here with a tour group. The falls are so pretty and I loved the sound of the rushing water. I did a little video of it on my phone so I could always listen to it. This is a must stop if you go to Jasper.\"So much wonderful scenery and we were fortunate enough to see a rainbow over the water. Take the easy walk around the falls to appreciate its beauty.Cheers - Jules\"\"Gorgeous waterfall, awesome hike..i am running out of adjectives to use for attractions at banff and jasper NP!\"Beautiful waterfall with very strong water force. There are several areas for viewing and Lots of great pictures to take here. Very scenic.\"This is a great place to get out of the car to stretch your legs on your way into Jasper. The falls are quite impressive. To see what the force of water can do over the years is truly amazing. There are stairs to walk and some inclines. But if you are mobile, you will enjoy this stop. Allow between 15 and 30 mins. Depending on how much you want to see.\"\"Due to being Canada's 150 and all the National Parks are free, it is extremely busy. If you want some great photos without people shoulder barging you, I reccomend not going at the peak times. If you're heading to Banff or Jasper I would say that this is a must see along the way!\"Nice falls - lots of geological history. Can be somewhat crowded but not too much so. Raft trips can be seen below the falls in the riverStop and see for sure! Short walk from parking. One of the best waterfalls anywhere. Short drive from Jasper.Beautiful falls. They are a must visit! Go early in the morning to avoid crowds. Nice walks along the river and the road leads back to the ski hill.\"This can be said for just about any of the stunning places along the Icefields Parkway between Jasper and Banff on a holiday weekend in July, but it was just too crowded. Still it is an amazing place. I prefer to hike the extra miles to get away from the crowds, but it's still worth stopping in to see.\"\"It was a busy warm weekend, and the side trip to see the falls, is always worth it!. Not to hard of a walk and the view is always amazing! Parking was no issue, many bathrooms, short walk, and I suggest prior to 10:00 am before the crowd saturates the view points. Please stay on the trail, it is frustrating to see visitors not follow the rules, and please use the garbage cans, keep our parks system pristine for the next generation to enjoy!\"Highly recommend! Easy walk and so pretty! Getting there early is always good to enjoy it. It does get busy and you'll want to enjoy it.The falls are absolutely stunning. It was a bit crowded so I would advise going in the morning. So worth it!Gorgeous falls. Don't miss this! It is worth every minute you spend there. Awesome site to visit but be careful with children\"Maybe not the same scale as Johnston and Maligne Cantons, but easier accessibility and still beautiful!\"\"The falls are easily accessible, off the highway and near the parking lot. We were lucky enough to catch a rainbow during the time which made the falls even more spectacular. The site is a main tourists spot with many buses making the rounds. Go there early if you are looking for less crowds\"Easily manageable for most people. Not wheelchair accessible. Quite dramatic picture ops! Busy place in July.\"Unbelievably spectacular waterfall in beautiful setting. Well worth the time to see this, but be careful not to fall in and kill yourself.\"I was pleasantly surprised by what a nice falls this was. It was also made better by being able to completely go around it. The park service had done a great job of providing a viewing path allowed for so many angles of this beautiful falls.Great place to stop. Very small area when it's busy. Very good road and washroom facilities. A great shop to take a look very friendly staff.The falls actually twists and turn almost like canyon. For photo to capture the whole falls from top to bottom is difficult and a wide angle lens wider than 12 mm is needed.\"If you are on highway 93 between Jasper and Lake Louise you gotta make time for these falls. Easy parking of the road, no hiking if you want a easy activity and we went at 8.30pm and it was quite and lovely in low evening sun.\"A quick stop along the way. It was hard to appreciate the beauty given the high volume of people. If you park along 93a you can avoid most of the trail by walking immediately to the main bridge to view falls. You can escape just as easily to avoid walking in the crowds.Breathtaking.AmazingPower of the water is surrealThe entire icefields parkway ride has so many stop offs and viewing sites and natural wonders. Please do not plan your vacation short just to avoid a hotel stay. We enjoyed the ride from Banff and enjoyed the ride greater when we returned from Jasper. Thank you to our Canadian neighbors.Love these falls. Have stopped here twice. Always amazing. Plenty of parking. Even parking for our Airstream! Worth about a half hour or more\"Pictures do not do this place justice. The volume of water and the sound it makes is unbelievable. There is a boardwalk for you to follow where there are amazing picture opportunities.Well worth the visit.\"The falls are right off the highway and are beautiful. They are well worth stop. There is minimal walking to the falls.\"We spent a couple of hours here later in the evening, and there was no crowd at all. The falls are beautiful but so is the canyon. Definitely worth a stop.\"You must hike the 2.5 mile round trip to the bottom of the falls. So beautiful. You can see how powerful the falls can be.This was our last stop driving from Calgary to Jasper so it had been a long day already - but worth a stop since it is a quick walk from the parking lot. Photos really don't do it justice so just stop and appreciate the roaring sound of the water the mist in your face and the natural beauty of the blue water.\"So much water flows wildly through this section of the river it makes for an amazing site and waterfall. Walk the trails, stay a while and listen to the thunderous roar of the water, look out for the local wildlife and get lost in its beauty. If I lived in this area I'd come over and over again just to experience this natural ruggedness and beauty of this place.\"\"If you drive through there make a stop- Its a nice Fall but very crouwded- better Visit wells grey Park, all 4 Main falls areMore spectacular and less crowded\"Waterfall plus mountains equals absolutely beautiful. Falls are right off the parkway. Great place to get out and stretch your legs on the drive between Banff and Jasper.Definitely don't miss this stop. I've visited quite a few falls in BC and these ones rank as some of the best I've seen... mainly because the public is able to so close to these.This was one of the easier walks to the fast moving water and falls. all the pathways safe to walk on. Being there in June the water was flowing very swift and beautiful to see!Get up close and personal with these falls. There is a very short walk to the Falls area and then you can take another walk down into a canyon area to see where the falls continue down the river. There are stairs down this area and you don't want to miss it if you can handle stairs. The powerful river is amazing. To see how the water has cut through the rock over the years is a sight to behold. Don't miss!!!\"Do not miss this site -- an easy walk from the parking area immediately immerses you in the beauty, sights, and sounds of rushing water.\"\"Easy to get to, practically next to the parking lot, a bit busy with tourist buses. I've seen a lot of waterfalls, this one is nice, above average. Because it is quick and easy to see and you are in the area, definitely should stop by.\"\"Stopped here on our way to Jasper. Great stop. Beautiful falls, able to walk around and go down to the bottom of the falls to a rocky beach area where you can climb around near the water. Some people took off their shoes and were in the water. There is also a walking path to view the falls closer up as well as other other trails. Good stop to get out, walk around, and take in beautiful views. Definitely recommend!\"\"Absolutely beautiful, the tumbling water really pulls you in. But when you look at the bigger picture how the water has cut through the rocks over thousands of years it's mind blowing. I'd love to show pictures and a video but Trip app won't pick up on my photos. Sorry you should visit you won't be disappointed.\"\"These falls are not spectacular in height but in the simple process of forcing an enormous amount of water through a very tight opening, they are an awe inspiring demonstration of the power of nature.Access is easy, just off the Icefields Parkway and parking was busy on the day we visited but there was frequent turnover. The walk to the falls was easy. There are plenty of viewing spots so don't stress if the first few ones are clogged by selfie takers - the spots further on are better!The short walk down to the lake is worthwhile to see the geology that contributes to this spectacle.As a footnote, there are many signs to stay within the fenced areas, which seems obvious given the power of the falls, strong currents leading to them, freezing temperature of the water and slippery rocks. Nevertheless, there were also signs that someone dies every couple of years by disobeying these signs and memorial benches dedicated to them.\"\"On a coach tour, this is usually just a short stop on the way to or from Jasper. It would be worth much more, because it is a true wonder of nature. The water is cascading down on the rocks with great power and provide you with a magnificent view. There are several footbridges and well paved paths over and along the torerential, white water stream. It rushes through narrow and deep canyons, giving the visitors endless photo opportunities. The paths are good enough (at least at most parts)for wheelchair access, although if I recall it rightly, there are sections which can only be negotiated through steps. A great experience, not to be missed!\"\"Fantastic views, spent a couple of hours walking round the falls.Spectactular. It was a very hot day, but the water from the falls was cool and rereshing.\"\"We were driving past on our way to Jasper and saw lots of other cars turn off the road. We followed out of curiosity and really enjoyed an unanticipated, short wander round this interesting spot. The waterfalls are the star of course but the rock formations are interesting too. We'll worth a 30 minute stopover.\"\"Short stop off main road Jasper National park.Beautiful falls demonstrate the power water. Parking is limited.\"\"We visited the falls with friends, lovely views etc. But I found it very frustrating for I have a knee problem and had to give up for there was many steps and slopes to undertake.\"\"This is a must visit. It is only a couple of minutes off the main road, parking is free. The falls are reached by boardwalks and is suitable for all ages. Even in the heat of the day you are cool because of the water and overhanging trees.\"\"After seeing many falls in our visit to Banff and Jasper National Parks, I wasn't sure about seeing another. However a friend had recommended we go so we did. Thrilled we didn't skip this breathtaking falls. Definitely worth a visit. Good for families with kids of all ages.\"The Athabasca Fall is just off the highway and a wonderful site to see. It is very easy to walk around the Falls the site is jaw dropping amazing. One of our favorite site on our 10-day trip to Alberta.We had lots of little kids with us and the fall's path were short and stroller friend. Not as busy as Maligne canyon.Stop on a whim and was pleasantly surprised. Short walk to falls that were very picturesque. Offered to take pictures for visitors.\"I'm sure it's great early in the morning but it was packed when we went at 5:30pmI would recommend Mistaya canyon instead\"\"We have seen quite a few water falls on this trip but this was the best to date. Spill off from glaciers high in the mountains cascades down at a fantastic rate. Admittedly I doubt people would shower under these falls unless they have the all clear from a cardiologist. The water is freezing cold, admittedly what else could you expect.\"The falls were magnificent...the picture doesn't do it justice. I took a video and that is much better. The amount of raging water was incredible.We just pass by this Fall. The view is great. Too bad we didn't have much time to hiking around. Walking around area is easy.\"We stopped here as we drove up the Icefields Parkway. The view was good near the parking lot but by walking a little bit, we were able to see the full expanse of the drop.\"Drove out to Athabasca Falls without knowing too much about it...very easy walk to the falls and worth every step....many different view points before you actually get to the falls. You even have a chance to go down to a beach ...but quite a climb down. Other than this walk down the rest of the walk was fairly easy..Beautiful spot and well worth the trip.\"Located very close to the Icefields Parkway and very easy to get to, it's definitely worth stopping at the falls.\"\"If you are visiting has per national park make to visit a visitor's center. We found this whilst driving, not from the road signs.It is a work of nature and worth a visit. I would say that this is not a visit for a day more about an hour or so.A definite recommend on any trip to has per national park.\"\"We visited Athabasca Falls for Canada Day. The weather was nice. I went with family, and we didn't know what to expect -- we hadn't saw any pictures. We just found it on a map, and decided we wanted to visit.The rushing river, the falls and the cold spray/mist of the water is inspiring.I have a heart condition, and can't do much stairs, but I was able to get around for the most part. The only thing I was unable to do, was walking down to the canyon below, which meant tons of stairs coming back up.There are some negatives that have nothing to do with natures beauty however.Parking was ridiculous. It probably took 15 minutes to park -- cars lined up, everyone scouting for vehicles leaving so they'd snatch that parking space. Some people resorted to parking on the side of the road. Of course it was Canada Day, so it'd be busier than usual. But I didn't know what to expect. And considering you're in the middle of nowhere, you wouldn't expect city-like congestion.I didn't use the washroom, but 2 of my travel mates did. The acrid sharp stench of the bathrooms was unbearable. And my friend said on top of the dirty conditions, he noticed shoe-prints on the toilet seat. For alot of newcomers to Canada, all they knew in their home countries, was to \"\"squat\"\" to go to the bathroom. It's unfortunate that they haven't learned how to use our toilets. I guess this is part of \"\"multiculturalism\"\"? Because it was Canada Day, there were instances where I was the only English speaking person around. All I heard was Chinese, arab, hindi, pakistani, etc.The actual beauty of the falls is worth checking out. But as for amenities, it leaves something to be desired.\"A very short hike to see the power and wonder of water. The mosquitoes are a pain (load up on bug spray) and go to the lower Falls if you can manage stairs.\"We did this stop while driving to Jasper, and it's definitely a must do! The views of the waterfall are spectacular, and it's all within easy walking distance from the parking lot :)\"It's definitely one of the better ones in the Jasper National Park. Easily accessible from the parking with a minutes walk. The information signs are interesting and the viewing platforms are very safe for young children as long as an adult is holding hands. There are three different points to view the falls and all are equally beautiful.A brief stop on our Collette Canadian Rockies Tour. Easy walking trails with several viewing points of the falls.With limited mobility we throughly the short level walk and were in awe of natures power to change the landscape.\"This is a must see - any time of the year! It's so gorgeous, you are not going to believe that there is a highway near the viewing platforms. Bring your camera and walk the entire way because you will get different view points and all are beautiful. To me this signifies Alberta's rough and beautiful nature.\"\"The Falls are impressive and there are numerous paths to take advantage of the features.Good parking and toilets.Signage from Jasper made it easy to find.\"We though we had seen the best after hiking Sunwapta Falls. More crowded but better. The short hike to the river is an added bonus and gets you away from the crowds.Loved this attraction. This was my 2nd time to this place and it felt awesome. Multi layered falls with multiple viewpoints. A must visit if you are in the area.It's right off the ice field parkway. It's a short walk from parking lot. Maybe under 10 minutes and you are already at the lower fall. Great excursion when traveling between banff and jasper. We didn't take the hiking trail to go along river. But I have a feeling we already got the best view on the fall.Park and an easy walk to three levels to see the falls . Nice picture taking opportunity. Don't miss.\"One of several beautiful waterfalls in Banff National Park. A group of professional hikers were hanging ropes across the falls, possibly to shoot a video or commercial. Easy access from Hwy 93 & worth visiting.\"\"Worth stopping off to look at and hear the rush of water as it passes through the narrow gorge. Superb photo opportunities.Shouldn't be missed.\"\"Definitely worth a visit, amazing waterfall, plenty of parking, lots of mozies so wear repellent if you don't want to get bit\"\"The Falls are impressive and the paths, platforms and informational signs are all good. We took many photos and were pleased to find good parking and toilets. We made this a separate trip from Jasper rather than a stop by on our way to Banff and are glad we did as we could not have spent the time these falls deserve.\"Not the biggest waterfall you will see but it may well be one of the most picturesque. The water has created its own path downhill and in doing so has created an interesting waterfall. It is well worth the time spent contemplating the whole geological process happening before your eyes.We went in June at the end of the winter melt so there was plenty of water I do not know what this attraction looks like at other times.The walk is short and viewpoint good for photography although I doubt you ability to do justice to the power evident in the falls.\"Great photo opportunity, lovely falls that you can appreciate from a few different angles to appreciate the power of the water.\"This is a definite must visit. Simply loved it. We visited this fall on our way from Glacier Icefield to Jasper Town. There are a number of other falls along the way but this is definitely the best. We even caught a rainbow over the fall too. Simply beautiful and amazing. And it is only approx. 30 mins from Jasper town.We visited this waterfall as part of a day-long bus tour. It was our last stop and the most enjoyable of the day. So beautiful! So much power! It's an easy walk from the parking lot to the falls and definitely worth a stop.\"Spectacular scenery - well worth the visit.Nature is amazing!!Make sure you have plenty of 'film' or memory card space!\"\"A definite must do if travelling down to Lake Louise or Banff.Went in June so lots of water from the winter season coming down.\"\"The most awesome display of mother nature and her waterfalls that I've yet seenVery well laid out with good viewing points and not overcrowded when we were there\"\"Stopped in while travelling with my parents. The falls are absolutely amazing! Loved all the little trails, especially seeing where the the water used to run through!\"The numerous water falls make this River so interesting to photograph and just enjoy the power of the fast flowing water. The river actually flows North which is a novelty for me being from the lower 48. The cold temperature of the water makes a refreshing mist as it cascades through the narrow gorges. There are many viewing locations within a short walking distance from parking area.\"Athabasca Falls is in Jasper National Park on the upper Athabasca River, approximately 30 kms south of Jasper Canada, and west of the Icefields. The falls can be seen and photographed from various viewing platforms and walking trails around the falls. Access is from the nearby parking lot, which leads off Highway 93A just northeast of the falls. Highway 93A takes off from the nearby Icefields Parkway, and crosses the falls on the way north to the town of Jasper. White water rafting often starts below the falls to travel downstream on the Athabasca River to Jasper.It is a Class 5 waterfall, with a drop of 24m and a width of 18m. (Thanks for the help of Wikipedia to get my directions right!)You will need about 30 minutes to view this. Worth a stop.\"\"Second time visiting this fall in 6 years and not a bit disappointed, the fall and the calm-after-the-fall area are both stunningly beautiful, the stairs going down are good photo oppt. Good enjoyable hour spent there. Highly recommended. Parking may be an issue if you get there late in high season.\"We took a bit of a side trip from Jasper to see the Athabasca Falls - and we were rewarded with another beautiful display of the powers of nature. The waters roar over the falls and into the several crevasses that have formed over the years. There is an entire separate ecosystem around the falls where you can see all kinds of different kinds of fauna . You need to walk to the bottom of the main waterfall to really feel and see the power of the water. Then continue walking to the opposite side of the falls so you get to feel the spray . So pretty and breathtaking. Worth the short drive from Jaser.We had no idea what to expect but this stop on our tour was one of the best. There's a hardened path (not paved) but very easily navigated from parking to the falls that takes 3-5 minutes to walk. The falls are very impressive - such a great place to take photos. When we were there it was very congested with people but it was well worth our time and effort.\"Visited here during a day trip to Jasper and it's attractions. The falls whilst having some steps and slopes are within easy access of the car park. When we visited, early afternoon, there were some crowds but not sufficient to get in our way or detract from our visit. The views all round are beautiful and the falls exhibit quite clearly years of water erosion on the rocks, creating pot holes - just remember your camera to capture it or an audio video is well worth the effort to capture it all.\"\"We are in Jasper for a couple of nights on an organised Saga holiday from UK through to Calgary, Banff, Jasper, Rocky Mountaineer and cruise to Alaska.This is an included photo stop on an organised day trip. Everywhere we have been in Canada so far has given us the WOW factor, and this is no different. In spring, with the snow melt from the mountains, there is a huge volume of water coming through this narrow gorge. Combine that with the surrounding geological features and consider that the falls have been eroding the gorge for millions of years and you are a part of history of the place. It is then that you realise how insignificantly small we are in the bigger picture.\"\"One of my favourite spots in Jasper. I come here often. I had a lovely day taking in the scenery. Parking was busy but do able. What I hated though was the mess made by people coming on and off the tour busses. There were several busses there and people were littering I think the tour director should personally pick up the mess if your guests are too lazy to do so. This is a national park. Tip - go first thing before 9am or after 5pm after the rush. Go down the steps to the pothole and enjoy the rushing water, the beautiful colour of the falls and see if you can spot the rainbow. Take eerie pictures on the steps when nobody is around. Amazing.\"Another beautiful sight to see in western Canada. So impressive and yet another representation of the strength and beauty of nature. We loved it.\"It's worth stopping here for 20-30 mins just to see the surge of water and the mist created by this beautiful and powerful waterfall. The walkway is easy to follow, with informational signs along the way. Definitely take a little time out to experience these Falls.\"Excellent view of the falls with interpretation boards along the path. The path is an easy walk and parts of it are wheelchair accessible. Worth the stop and short hike (about 100 yards) from the parking lot.\"We stopped here, while heading south from Jasper. Parking was easy, with a couple of lots. The falls are magnificent. The roaring water, and the mountains in the back ground make them really outstanding. The pathways are paved, and easy to get around. We lucked out, and got to meet a guy (Colin from Grande Prairie?) doing slack-lining across the falls. He had a rope tied to each side of the falls. He walked across and back, barefoot! Whoa! It was unbelievable. What a character, and what nerves of steel!It's a beautiful place to stop, and get lots of photos.\"\"Amazing waterfalls and very easy to access. Very popular stop so parking can be a challenge, but well worth the trip.\"\"We were glad we stopped to see the falls. It was the last stop before Jasper and we were tempted to pass it by. Easy walk, and doable for those w mobility issues. Very picturesque. 20 minutes or so does it justice.\"\"I hail from Arizona so when I see a waterfall, I go crazy with the water volumes, feeling incredibly energized and quite frankly, envious. The water here is crazy big this season from the snow melt and the glacier melt from upstream cutting through the granite. The wooded and rocky setting added to ambiance. The walkways are easy to navigate as the fresh and moist air is enjoyed. No bugs in June!\"Stunning to watch--amazing! Beautiful areas to walk and take pictures--take the canyon walk and try to imagine the water flowing with such force!Easy stop off of the icefields Parkway . Trails at top and to bottom of falls. Many perfect picture spots. Some if it is handicapped accessible. Port o potties in parking lot . Plan on 20-30 minutes.\"This place is magical, the force of the waters have carved out a beautiful setting to see. Walkways are railed off for safety but children should be attended to.\"\"Of the many falls along the Icefield Parkway this one is very easily accessible after just a short walk, and is an amazing spectacle for it's pure beauty and power.\"\"Great hiking trails, the falls you can follow all the way during your walk... just beautiful... nature at it's best\"\"We loved this hike! We started at the first bridge and worked our way down. My husband was smart enough to realize that my in laws and 6 year old daughter may not want to trek back uphill and ran back to the car, parked at the 5th bridge parking lot and met us in the middle. It is a long walk back uphill if you start from the 1st bridge. If you have small kids you may want to do what my husband did or hike from 6th or 5th bridge lot up and have a nice downhill return. Gorgeous!\"We were on a tour of a near by area and decided to call in for a look. Beautiful scenery and a smooth water course that changes as it enters a narrow channel that become the falls. Lots of photo opertunities to get pictures of the water hurling through the rocks and dropping in spactular fashion through th gorge until it completes its charge into a lower lake. There is a bridge crossing the gorge that leads to hiking trails or a loop back to the car park.What a great visit to see the waters fall and thunder by. Great views and lovely pics taken. A WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE ALL ROUND. a MUST SEE.\"This actually was my first trip to Athabasca Falls, I thought it was amazing coz of the proximity to the water from where I stood. I could feel the energy that was roaring by me. Never underestamite the power of water!!\"\"Worth a visit if you are passing through, the area is quiet and falls worth a view. There are also picnic areas and toilet facilities on site\"Beautiful waterfalls with hiking trails. A short stop-over to Jasper from our packaged excursion to the Columbia Icefield and saw strong rapid water gushing from the falls and at times forming a beautiful rainbow over it. Beautiful serene surrounding the falls.Well worth a slight detour to have a look. Well laid out trails allow viewing of the falls. The water was rushing through when we were there in the Spring.Gorgeous views how the waters and time has routed out the caverns and pools for the water. Wonderful experience.\"Loved going to this beautiful attraction. I would recommend good walking or hiking boots, a camera, bug spray and a sense of adventure! It's not a very difficult hike, but it does require some stability on the up/down.\"\"This stop is educational and impressive. This stop has outhouse facilities, picnic tables and clean water. Parking is ample and the venue is handicap accessible. Allocate a minimum of 30 minutes for this stop.\"\"beautiful falls & several areas to look above or below the falls. don't stay at the upper view point, be sure to walk down the trail for wonderful views as well. can feel crowded along walkways if several tour buses are there\"t doesn't matter how often you come here the magistic scenery is breath taking. It is a chance to just enjoy what nature is capable ofVery few words can describe this place. Mainly stunning and wow! It's only a short stroll from the car park and well worth a quick stop off to see the falls. Take plenty of pictures from all angles. You will get plenty of good ones!Nice stop on the Icefield Parkway but more crowded than the opening of a new IKEA. Probably best to avoid middle of the day.One of the best sites in Jasper. The power of the falls was amazing. They did a good job with the interpretive displays. Easy trail to walk around and see from different perspectives.Lovely walk by the falls Interesting scenery and well worth the walk - a bit challenging for those with mobility issues.The falls are not very tall but nonetheless very pretty. You will love the place. Ideal picnic spot. We saw it as part of our tour with Brewster.We took a motorcycle tour to the Falls. They are breathtaking. We could have looked at them all day. Highly recommend!You view falls from thw top end of it here. We cisited when it was raining heavy and water was wild. It has some good walkways made around it and picture spots too but there are many othwr great falls apart from it. Nothing special about it.\"The Athabasca Falls is approximately 33 kilometers south of Jasper and offers very scenic views and good viewing vantage points. Good parking, pathways and a great place to have a picnic lunch.\"\"We left Jasper early one morning and went straight to the Falls. By the time we arrived, it was snowing rather heavily (early June 2017) and we were almost alone there. There are many waterfalls in the Banff-Jasper area, but these are well worth a visit. Like everything else, however, I would definitely go early to beat the tour bus crowds.\"We loved the falls. The power of the water was impressive. Easy to walk around and great picture vantage points.\"My title says it all. It is NOT the largest, most powerful or grandest of all falls, but it is impressive in it's own right. I find it simply amazing what plain old water can do to something as strong and hard as stone. Persistence!!\"Definitely a large reward for the little effort to get to these falls. Something amazing to see without a long hike. They are so beautiful and there are a lot of different points on the trail to see them. Also the walk through the carved rock is kind of like a tunnel and a neat experience.The falls a an amazing place to visit anytime of the year. Frozen in winter and very energizing during spring and summer time. Fantastic spot to visit while spending time in Jasper.Well worth spending an hour here to take in all the different views of these Falls. There are many Falls in the park but you can really walk around this one to take it all in. Very powerful!What stunning views from here. Even braved the glass viewing platform and was so glad I did. Perfect place for photos.Well worth the visit. Got quite a few stunning photos here. Could have spent much more time at this location.Very easy walk too see this waterfall once you park.......worth the trip to view if you like waterfalls!What an amazing place...the beauty is undescribable. We stopped here on a whim...it wasnt on our list of places to visit. So happy we did...so please add to your list for a spectaclar site!!The recent rains fueled the falls. They were really going when we visited. Rangers shared info about a 12 point elk horn and a big horned sheep horn. They let us hold the horns to feel the weight. We got selfies with the rangers too. The falls are a very easy short walk from the parking area.Love Athabasca falls. Took my kids for the first time. Just the scenery is breathtaking. Kids were amazed\"One great vista after another. Water colors unrivaled with chasms, garges, and falls galore. Well worth a visit.\"We stopped here on our way to the hotel in Jasper - stunning. Absolutely stunning. Worth the wander around it for some excellent photos.\"This is a must see, you cannot go up the Parkway and not stop here for a look, well worth the stop, plus it's only a short walk to the falls\"\"After a disappointing ice field visit, we were impressed with the falls. We were able to take in the beauty of the falls, river, and rock formations that make this attraction a need to see. Even with a number of tourasses around, we got good views of the areas open to the public and see the wonders of nature. Stop in and see this if you are ever in the area. It is a must see.\"We were lucky enough to have a totally blue sky and sun for our visit here. We literally had rainbows over the falls. Stunning!We liked this because of its easy accessibility. No long hikes to the waterfall itself. We visited in Spring so waters were at a high level and the sound and fury of the waters as they fell into the gorge was a sight (and sound) to behold. Interesting rock formation around the gorge too.\"On the Icefields Parkway in Jasper National Park, Alberta, CA. Rated one of the most scenic highways in the world, and justly deserved, these falls are a don't miss topping to magnificent scenery. Essentially the Grand Tetons of Canada in my opinion\"Great fall at the Icefields Park Way. Short easy trail to the fall. What a power water has. Nice viewspots.A short drive from Jasper to view wonderful scenery. A great location for photography. There are also toilets at this spot.Great place to get out and walk all around the falls. They have done a great job making it very easy to look at from all angles.The amount of water this year was incredible! The water was high and moving so fast. The spray was like a light shower. Beautiful and awesome to feel the power of this waterfall. One of the most impressive falls in the area.We stopped by these falls when most of the rivers in this area were at flood stage. The amount of water flowing over the falls was astounding. They were as beautiful as Niagara Falls.\"This was part of Rockies tour and it was awesome, would recommend it to all ages to see, a slight walk not to demanding but worth it, views are awesome.\"\"Very well organised and very short walk from car parkThe old canyon is also very interestingDefinitely to be visited\"\"Such a beautiful spot, a must stop on your trip if you can accommodate. The falls are spectacular and there are lots of great vantage points and photo opportunities.\"Stopped here on our way to Jasper. Lovely area with good views of the waterfall. Nice place for picnic.\"Just stunning!! We are in awe of the amount of water around Canada and the amazing waterfalls as a result. Great views, lookouts and hiking trail.\"Spring thaw came late this hear so the falls were more like a glacier the\\an a waterfall . Very beautiful and an adventure to negotiate the frozen and flooded paths .One of our 'must sees' on our trip and not disappointed. We intended to go to the Ink Pots but the views and photo opportunities to the upper falls meant we ran out of time. The trail has been made to allow easy access with minimal disruption to the natural beauty of the canyon.Easy pull off of Icefields Parkway. Beautiful falls with great viewing areas. Lots of parking. Would be a lovely place for a picnic.Wonderful truly enjoy this . Impressive. Not very crowded when we went. Beautiful pictures taken. Be careful walking around not very safe but worth the effort.\"The best of best places is in here. I mean JASPER. Another place one can never skip to visit . As far as I know I am going for round 2,3....\"Great photo shots from many areas. Reminded me of Watkins Glen in NY. Great to see snow around the falls in multiple areas.\"Although it was a small fall, it was simply superb! There were a few angles to view the fall, so it was just refreshing to see it at those angles. Took a lot of pictures..Look out for the rainbow!\"You can get very close to the falls from a number of vantage points. Easy to walk to. Be sure to also see the abandoned waterway along the walking trail to the falls.\"The fall is located right by the Icefield Parkway, an easy stop between Jasper and Banff. It offers a short stroll to see snow-capped mountain and a nice fall.\"\"It didn't seem like much when we started but the falls are just beautiful. It twists and turns through narrow rock chasms, huge holes carved by the waters. The paths and bridges through the area give wonderfully different view for some great photos.\"I visited as part of a touring holiday and was blown away by these falls. They were truly a sight to be seen at this time of year as they were in full flow.A great waterfall to visit near Jasper. Quite easy to reach and very god facilities at the attraction. It is a 15 minute walk from the car parking to the waterfall area. It is well paved and easy to get to. There are a lot of areas where you can get great views of the falls for great photo Op. On the whole we had a very memorable time here and highly recommend it.\"This was our last chance to stretch our legs and engage our eyes on the Brewster Icefields Parkway Banff to Jasper Tour. We stopped 30 miles short of Jasper and ambled from the car park set away from waterfall (with facilities available after all that rushing water). We had time to take some close shots of the Falls and its glorious mountain backdrop and stroll over the different bridges for different views. As always it would have been good to have walked a little further and spent more time taking in the beauty, but that's not the point of a tour like this. . Our Brewster's driver, Jarrod, who'd been excellent all the way had the unfortunate job of finishing the tour by telling us of a cancelled Maligne Lake tour the next day due to a forest fire in the wrong place. His care of us on the day would make me recommend this tour to others.\"\"An easy stop right off the highway a short distance south of Jasper. Paved walkways and stairs take you around, above, across and below the falls and canyon. Very much worth the time to visit. We took the back road (not maintained in winter) on the trip into Jasper and found this less traveled route very scenic and interesting. The road is paved but is bumpy and narrow in places.\"Impressive waterfall located just off the Icefields Parkway. Definitely worth a photo stop especially in springtime when snowmelt provides lots of flow.\"The Athabasca Falls is worth the visit if you are in the area. Plan to stay around 30 minutes if you plan to see everything, including the old canyon.\"So close to roaring water. You will get some fabulous pictures! Only takes 15 minutes and well worth the time.\"Make sure you visit these Falls, they were amazing. So much water rushing through the rocks and falling down\"\"A good pretty falls, you do get a bit punch drunk on the amount of the falls and they do all start to fade together but these were good. A nice walk too on a good day . Worth the visit\"A lot of these places are good if you are touring by car. Good explanatory boards to aid your visit. just allow 30 mins unless you want to do the hiking round itThis may not be the biggest waterfall in the world but it is a worthwhile stop to stretch your legs and see both the force of the waterfall and the peaceful river.We almost missed going here and are so glad we did go. It is a very pretty falls and hardly anyone was there.We enjoyed our visit to the falls. It takes about an hour if you go slowly. It is safe and beautiful.\"The Athabasca river really thunders through this narrow gorge. Lots of paths and bridges to allow you to see and photograph safely, but still understand the power of the river.Its a good 30 minute stop on the road between Jasper and Lake Louise, or you can follow the trails and spend lots of time. Once you leave the main track there are few people around. The main parts get tourist coaches by the dozen.\"\"It's on occasions like this that TripAdvisor's rating policy confuses me. If, as many reviewers have rated it, this is a 5 star attraction, then how many stars would Niagara Falls receive from the same reviewers? This is pleasant enough and worthy of a trip whilst visiting Jasper or driving down the 93, but it's no Niagara so we've given it a rating of 3 which we think is fair. We arrived fairly early in the day and it was very pleasant, although it was spoilt when a coach load of tourists arrived and rather rudely noisily jostled for prime positions. I can imagine it's not overly pleasant during high season. The parking lot was probably 10% full when we arrived and I'm guessing it won't be much fun when it's full. Recommended, but be careful when you go and only expect a 5 start attraction if you've never seen a waterfall before!\"\"We were on a three week vacation from the UK travelling around western Canada. We dropped in about 9.30 am as it was very easy on our way from Jasper to Lake Louise. We were surprised to see so many coaches there already so early, but it did not stop us from seeing the Falls briefly. There was no need to hang about though. If you can, get there before 9.00 am.\"\"These falls are beautiful and stunning, with lots of informative signs to tell you all about what you are looking at and seeing.\"The Athabasca River thunders through a narrow water-carved sluice here and a network of paved paths and bridges allow visitors to safely approach and observe up close the power of the river. It was a special treat to spot some delicate ground orchids blooming near the path here in late May.Happened to visit Athabasca on our way out from Jasper to Banff. Stopped there and it was the most amazing place I saw. Highly recommended!\"Picturesque spot, wide falls with lots of water flowing over, saw a rainbow in the falls. Spend a little or a lot of time.\"A nice waterfall to see. It wasn't too crowded. You can get a good view from the bridge. Not far out of the way.Love the main attraction but lots of other interesting views as well. In may the little calypso orchids are out so delicate along the forest pathway.\"See the initial falls, then see the results off the falls down to the lake. It is really impressive to follow the water. We saw the falls in a dry period and after a rainy perio, really impressive!\"We visited this on a cloudy day. Even though it was cloudy it was still beautiful. The only thing was there were people jumping the fence to get very close to the waterfall and they were getting in the way of our pictures.\"Well worth a stop on the way to or from the glacier, allow plenty of time to explore the trails and take photographs from the many viewpoints.\"\"Great hike, easy trail - not too long, not too short . Excellent place to stop when going to Jasper.\"\"Been there three times. They are beautiful falls and canyon... This time, went there in the winter... slippery... The falls were hard to see as they were covered by ice... an interesting perspective and contrast to seeing them in the summer\"\"Hardly anyone there. The rush of the falls. Ravens feeding chicks in nests built into the rockface. Need telescope camera to get into their rock face nooks... Moss pillows on tops of canyon, narrow gorges and the sound of rushing waters...different colours of rock formations...too beautiful; a cold day so couldn't stay out too long, will try for autumn next year.\"Beautiful views and landscape. Popular stop for tourists. Not stroller friendly. My father inlaw said this was his favourite stop on our rocky mountain trip.\"Your hike here can be as short or as long as you want it to be. From the parking area, you can get to all the major angles of the falls within a few minutes. But you also have the option of walking up the river, so it's really the perfect hike. I suggest getting there early - tourists tend to linger excessively long in all of those spots you'd like to take photos.\"\"The nice thing about this hike is that it is a short distance from the parking lot, so all ages can easily enjoy this place. There are plenty of informative signs around to educate you on the progression of the falls, potholes, the canyon, etc. You'll notice a temperature drop from the observation deck down to the canyon - and the mist from the falls feels nice on a warm day. Many great viewing angles available.\"If you are looking for an easy hike this is well worth your time. The sights are spectacular. A little off the beaten path we weren't fighting any crowds though we went off season.This is a must see for everyone to see the awesome power of water and time!..been over 25 years since we were last here and it's still amazing.We stopped at a lot of places along the Icefields Parkway from Banff to Jasper. This was our favorite. Beautiful area.\"Close to Jasper and great drive to locationTrails are great and must take go pro gear for capturing all scenic spotsYou can choose a short hike to open area to chill out and enjoy mountain peaks\"A must see. Gorgeous scenery and easy walking trails. Senior citizens will be able to navigate the trails with ease. Highly recommend adding this stop to your itenary.low water season but still worth the look. Easy walk to the falls from parking area. Short drive from townIt is a beautiful spot however it is full of tourists. Hard to take a picture without having other people in it. it is still worth a visit.\"Situated about 30kms from Jasper Athabasca Falls are very nice,heaps of parking for RV's and buses,easy walk down to the falls with various stops for good photo opportunities,toilets are there as well.\"Great scenery and really good little hike. Trails were a bit sloppy in place but that is to be expected that time of yearThe most stunning views and lots of boards posting geological explanations about the Falls. Easily accessible walk to the Falls which can be viewed from several lookout points. Good signage about safety and warnings to keep on the paths plenty benches to relax all around. Very level and easy walk. 30km south of Jasper a short distance off 93AThe walking/viewing area was very well done and offered enough options for everyone from short walks to more extensive areas.\"On a tip from a Parks Canada rep who suggested Athabasca Falls over Sunwapta Falls as we only wanted to do one, we stopped on our way to Jasper from the Columbia Icefields.We started with our stroller but took it back to the car in favour of a baby carrier so that we could do the further reaches of the trail. It's listed as a moderate trail, but I'd say that the main part is easy, but the old canyon section is moderate. The views were simply breathtaking. The water crashing was just awe-inspiring, and we loved that they included the old canyon on the trail so that you could see where the water used to go. If you have good shoes and can manage some steep steps and uneven ground, follows the signs to the river, where the water ends up. It's quieter than the Falls and a perfectly picturesque vista for photos.Fantastic stop, close to the highway and Jasper, and you don't need to walk far to be rewarded with fantastic views of the Falls and surroundings. Also has toilets and picnic benches, which is a bonus!\"Have been to these falls many times over the years. It's always a nice visit. The falls are beautiful and it's easy to get around with little ones.Athabasca falls are absolutely stunning place to see. we make sure we go every time. It changes every year because the water hitting the rocks. So many different views and walks to take.\"Good walking for whole family trip. Big,noisy and cold waterfall with gorgeous texture of mountings sure is best place to take a family pictures.\"So pretty and easy to see and take lots of photos. The color of the water is ice blue from the melting glacial waters.\"These falls were so beautiful. Right off of highway 93, it is a close walk from the parking lot and a great spot to stretch your legs while on a road trip. Easy paths to walk on, great for kids as well as pushing a wheelchair or stroller.\"\"The falls are just off the hiway and easily accessible so you can take as much or as little time as you like to explore, parking is good, washrooms available. Tourists - STAY ON THE TRAIL don't wreck the area.\"Very spectacular view. The rest area is well laid out and they have public restrooms as well. easy paths to walk. Very short distance from the vehicle to viewing areaWe visited these falls as part of our tour with Brewster's tours. The falls are beautiful and worth a visit.\"It's nice but not that amazing .Located near the road.Why I have to wright a lot.It's not that big fall in do not know why they call fall any way.\"Beautiful spot to visit - easy to get to if you're self driving. Lots of good spots for photos. While there are the trails along the falls - good walking shoes are a nice idea.Just go! It was an incredible walkabout falls that are fed by a glacier. It is a short walk and you will see the falls and walk through an old channel. Bring your camera for great shots. I just don't know where else in the world you can see nature like this.The falls are beautiful and a must stop and see if you are in the area. There are walking paths to many view points and public washrooms on site\"This is my favourite place to visit in Jasper (25km south on Hwy 93). Worth it to take the time to visit not only at the top, but at the bottom along the river. Never ceases to impress.\"\"Thunderous and thrilling cannot begin to describe the Athabasca Falls experience! Water is a beautiful hue, and it's journey through the rock formations is wondrous to behold.\"We passed by here after our Colombian Glacier Ice field trip and I may say we kept coming back here.It is a well kept falls with reasonable amount of parking .If you want a relaxing gateway this is the place .Beautiful scenery and lots of points of history in the area .\"Stopped here for 20 mins or so and it was only a short walk from the car park. Great attraction as the there were two falls actually, the one to the left is wider and more timid and the one to the right is narrower but pretty ferocious - reminds me of the power of Niagara Falls.\"\"A can't miss stop on the road to or from Jasper. Take video along with pics to get the sound of roaring waters.Easy hike\"Just off the highway and only a very short walk from the car park. The falls are definately worth the visit.Must visit place and ultimate to visit.It was owe some place and one must visit any season of the year.\"I stop in to visit these falls every time I am in the area. They are beautiful, but unfortunately crowded in the summer season. Snap your pictures quickly and prepare to step aside so everyone can enjoy a moment and opportunity to capture a memory. There are tons of little trails everywhere so if you have kids or pets, make sure they are attached to you in some way. The crowding can really overpower anybody under four feet tall. There are picnic areas which are nice and some are in the shade for hot days. I personally enjoyed my time the most when I visited once in March, not many people and parts of the falls were still frozen and gorgeous.\"This is a must stop while in the Jasper Park. There is plenty of parking and easy paved trails to view the waterfalls and river. The rock formation around this waterfall is so beautiful. The day we went it was raining and snowing so trails were pretty wet. We just stayed in the main area. There is lots of signs telling you about this area. Very interesting that this river and falls flows to the Artic Ocean.\"After having done the Maligne area (lakes & canyon) we had one final visit on the agenda: Athabasca Falls. (Our) GPS did not help out in finding it so we had to do it the \"\"oldfashioned\"\" way with a map, but that had too little detail. Resulting in us - coming from Jasper - starting at the wrong end of the 93A, coming around the long route to the falls.Some really bad sections of road we came across; better lift your foot off the gas there and try to avoid the worst patches (traffic allowing of course). Better of course to travel down the 93 South a bit further and take the second exit to the 93A.The Falls themselves at this time of year are spectacular with ice and snow still present. Makes for some great pictures, really. One can get pretty close to the Falls at various spots and angles. Absolutely worth the trip!\"\"It had been a long time since I visited the falls but we had family over from Ontario and we had time for 2 attractions - Athabasca falls had to make the list.The falls were kind of low because it was early in the season and the mountains still had a lot of melting to do. However, the path to the back area where you can check out the canyon was flooded so it was pretty difficult to get back there.Even with the lower water on the falls, it is still a majestic sight and sound (I love the roar). One of the water runs was frozen which was an added bonus.\"A great place to click lovely pictures ..Worth a visit on road trip from jasper to Banff ...We visited them in morningAfter visiting the Columbia ice field we returned to Jasper by way if the Athabaska falls. The walk round the falls is well laid out. There are notices to give you information and you are advised to set aside half an hour to do the walk. A path from one side of the lower area to the other side is currently under water so you need to walk along a couple of tree trunks! This may not appeal to everyone. At this time of year there is overhanging snow so it makes a very pretty sight.\"I highly recommend taking the time to stop here, it is definitely worth it. It's beautiful and easy to get around.\"The falls and the gorge that they have created are marvels of nature. Sort of puts in your place if you think that mankind can have a major long-term impact on the environment. Walk up and around and down the gorge for a full tour.\"Athabasca Falls are so lovely and the walk around the area is nice. The path to follow is an easy walk and the views of the river down below are awesome. The Athabasca River is a really nice color and makes for nice pictures. I will say, people need to be careful and mind the railings and barriers. People always want to climb over them to get better pictures, but people have fallen and died here, so respect the Park rules!\"\"Take your camera you will get plenty of great shots. Keep your eyes open for chipmunks, and other small animals. The falls are amazing and well worth the stop\"Visited only for a few minutes when driving to Jasper. Worth the stop to see the fall. Very pretty and there are a few levels you can stand at to see the fall.\"Excellent stop! Loved the Athabasca falls hike. we visited in August with our two teenage sons. Great hike, but gets busy so get their early.\"I've been to Athabasca Falls in all seasons and it's beautiful no matter what time of year it is! Lots of chances for great photos!\"We visit this falls during our way from Jasper to Banff. This falls are near the highway, but really nice to visit. It's no problem to visit it with young childs.\"Excellent stop. Unbelievable view of falls. With a mountains in the backround. Highly recommended. AND ITS FREEEEEE!!!!We took our 2 toddlers to the falls and had nice time. The walk is short and fairly easy. There was still some ice and snow on some parts of the path but we could see a lot. Part of the falls was frozen still. The lower walk way was so full of water that we couldn't access it like we could during summer. It's a must see and easy to visit with the whole family.\"amazing views, scenery, my favouirite place in Jasper. very peaceful and relaxing.I go there every time we are in Jasper.\"\"Very beautiful falls, there is picnic spots, and it is a short walk. Worth the detour from the road.\"\"Its all described in the other reviews, but if you're able-bodied enough, and have the time (and if you don't have the time them make time), and the underfoot conditions allow (i.e. its not iced over), then clamber your way down to the actual lake for a view that is simply spectacular. Dare to go for a paddle !\"\"Forget about it, don't go to Jasper or be on the Icefield Parkway and not stop here. Short walk from the parking lot for amazing view, longer trail down to the bottom if you're interested.\"Lovely stop off between Banff and Jasper. Good parking with outhouses. Great views over the falls with a large mountain in the background. Lovely colours in the water and we were lucky enough to see snow and ice down the falls.I wish we had more time to walk around all the trails but we had to settle for the main viewing area. It was truly beautiful and we will for sure go again and spend more time there.Great location as it was just a couple of minutes walk from the parking lot. Very close to highway. Turquoise waters.\"A spectacular view awaits you along many other recommendable stops along the Icefields Parkway. The gush of water squeezing past the gorge is mesmerising, you could stare at it forever!\"\"Located between Jasper and the Columbia Ice Fields …. The falls itself wasn’t particularly mind blowing, but historically it possessed enough strength to carve out a small gorge immediately downstream of it. Make sure you walk down the canyon to observe the force of the water and the beautiful different blues hues of the water\"\"We visited in April so it was still partially frozen but makes for a lovely stop on your way to/from Jasper.Accessible trail during warm seasons.\"\"In summer and winter it's just beautiful and a nice little hike down to the bottom, in summer you get a must which is really refreshing and the winter you can really see the amazing icicles and colours of the water\"\"30 minutes to walk arround , very bussy in summer, waterfalls are special! Parking area could be full.\"The waterfall itself is still iced over for the most part but it doesn't take away from the beauty of it all. A nice area for a picnic and take in the beauty and fresh air. Will be coming back this summerVery beautiful falls with milky blue water from the glacier flower. Easy hiking trails and great photo opportunities.\"The parking is ok. Thank god it had outhouses in the parking lot. At one end is the gift shop and food etc. The other end has the sign with the trail info to begin there. It doesn't matter which way you start. Not as packed as I thought it would be. But plan your trip wisely. If in tourist season get there early 7-9 am or you won't get parking. OR sleep in, organize the kids and get there for late lunch or dinner time. You're in the woods so a cooler time of day is best. Very well groomed trails. You cant get lost. You have your choice of a long or short hike. The more you hike the more you see. The path along the canyons and water are amazing. One trail loops around and is basically a trail running horizontally to the water trail but not much to see up there. I would have turned around and went back along the water trail again!. I couldn't stop taking pictures. Nice informational signs showing different birds, trees, plant species, history of this area. Great to stop and take a break for 30 seconds. The signs make the whole experience better because you'll start noticing all the stuff they're talking about. Its a great way to challenge kids to find everything on the sign. Make them read it and point out what they find. Bribe....I mean..... Reward them with ice cream as the prize haha. Anyways worth the trip. I was supposed to rock climb down these cliffs, on a tour, but I threw out my back brushing my teeth if you can believe it, so I couldn't go. That would have been awesome hanging right above the rapids and rushing water!\"\"Stunning as always, well worth the short drive south to see this beautiful location highly recommended\"\"Visited on route from Jasper to Banff on a very quiet day - there was only one other car in the car park. The falls are very close to the car park - 2 minute walk, but the walkway was very icy and could have been dangerous. But on arrival on the viewing bridge it was a spectacular site - falls were running under the ice and running through into a blue water channel through the canyon. Easy to access / great photo opportunity just off the main road.\"\"I've visited these falls before in summer and this time most of the falls were frozen BUT water was flowing and it was really interesting to see how the melt was being shaped by the water flow.Even in summer these falls are worth a visit, they're on the main route between Jasper lake Louise and Banff so there's no diversion necessary. The falls are 200 meters from the convenient car park very near the main road.\"Athabasca Falls is definitely worth the short drive and short walk to see the falls. It is a two or three minute walk from the parking lot. It is easy to see how the river cut through the rock if you stand and watch for a few minutes and just imagine the power. Walk over the bridge and take the trail to the right to the bottom.Easy access and paved pathways give access to this spectacular waterfall. The canyons are beautiful and there are stone staircase/steps that trail around part of the feature. Care should be taken and visitors should keep to the pathway. Climbing up on the outcrops can be dangerous and slippery (but I still saw people doing it while we were there). Benches and tables available for picnics.We had already done some hiking for the day and my children were tired so it was nice to be able to see this waterfall within steps of the parking lot. It isn't as spectacular in the winter but still beautiful. The road coming in was pitted and would be very rough for a car as the snow was melting but not much you can do about Mother Nature!They were nice but surprised they are not bigger--kind of icy walking the paths--had to hang onto the fence to prevent falling--maybe a bit of sand would help\"This is one of our favourite places to stop in the summer, these falls never disappoint us. We decided to check them out while they were frozen... they were amazing. No one in the parking lot. There is a short trek to the falls that was quite slick, but well worth the view. You need to stop here in the winter and the summer!\"\"Athabasca Falls has an extensive walkway and bridges around it, which gives you great views of the rushing water plummeting into the deep gorge and canyon. The turbulence of the water can be viewed from several aspects, one being right over it, so you can really appreciate the rushing water. It is said to have more volume ofvwater going over it than Niagara Falls. Beautiful scenery can be found all around the falls as well as on the route to it. Another great spot to stop in Jasper National Park.\"I have been to Athabasca Falls many times and in every season. It is never disappointing. The scenery is breathtakingly beautiful and well worth a visit! It is nice to check out in the less busy times as it can get quite crowded.\"Spring runoff made the walk glare ice. Brought boot traction aids and it made the trip much easier. Sport shops in town had them in adult small which fit our 3 and 5 year old kids, they loved it.\"\"30 mins south of Jasper are the spectacular falls. Definitely worth a visit. The walkways were very icy and slippery in March, but the short walk is worth the effort.\"A great little stop along the highway on your drive to Jasper from Banff or the other way around. A great little break for the kids in your car.\"If we say that The Niagara Falls are spectacular, then we would say that Athabasca Falls are charming. They just have different styles. The both are easily accessible. We're much closer to Niagara Falls ,so we hold the Athabasca Falls dearer.\"Short 15 minute walk to falls through the snow.Great shots of falls even though frozen..Lots of photo shots along the way.Dont get to close to frozen lake to get a better shot as a few people have lost their lives.\"With a powerful rush and roar, the falls drop 80 feet into a narrow gorge. You can see how water has carved the rock over eons. You can cross the gorge on a bridge, stopping mid way to gape from on high. It's a short walk from the parking lot.\"\"Before you get to Jasper, coming from Banff, first, it is very convenient to stop for a nice look at the Athabasca Falls, which are in Jasper National Park. There is a nice walkway or path that leads you to different viewpoints of the Falls. It is not a very large area, if there are a lot of people there at the same time as you are, you have to juggle your way around. But do stop for a look. Very pretty to see.\"Went to this place. It was beautiful. One must beware of the rainey season: the river can get really high and nasty.\"It was Spectacular... Well worth going for a look. We were driving down the highway and decided to stop for a look. WOW, what a sight, easy to walk to, the power of that Waterfall, what a site.\"\"We visited here in February so everything was frozen! Very scenic, great for photography but watch your step as the pathways were completely iced over.\"An extremely beautiful falls which is very easy to access. There is one spot where you can get fully wet from the drizzle from the falls. There is a trail from the falls which leads to a beautiful scenery.\"I have been to Athabasca Falls in summer and in winter it is so beautiful and impressive during both seasons! There are many view points and all parts around the Falls are fenced off! Please respect those railings, they are there for your safety!\"This falls drops 80 feet through a narrow gorge. An easy walking path takes you to see the top drop. There is a bridge over the gorge and multiple places to get great photos and videos. Mesmerizing and magnificent - the power of nature and the beauty of rock and water.A must see if you like water falls! Beautiful and powerful! Beautiful landscape! Just breath taking!\"Car park is located just off the highway within 1 minute drive, very short walk to the falls, with not too much of a hill. There is a trail around the falls so you can explore a bit more, not very strenuous to walk. Natural beauty and power of the falls is breathtaking\"\"About 20-25 minute drive south of Jasper, easy short walk from the parking lot. We went late February and the walkways and paths were super icy, so wear good footwear. So interesting to see the deep canyons and frozen waterfall, with pools of crystal-blue water swirling around. Definitely check out all the different viewpoints/lookouts, it's beautiful. Can't wait to come back in the summer to see the falls in all their glory!\"Always a hit to pitstop here with out of country friends or when travelling with kids or seniors.incredible photo ops.I actually recommend you to visit this place when it is warmer and in summer.. surely there's a beauty in frozen things but the life is frozen too .. it is super slippery and you will need cleats to go up and down..\"We arrived on a rainy morning--it was worth standing in the rain. Incredibly display of power, water, just amazing! Still got great photos (possibly even better ones than we'd have gotten if it were sunny).\"Beautiful in the winter when much of it is frozen. Worth the small walk from the road to get there. Highly recommend to anywhere driving through the icefield parkways.\"Enjoyed a lovely walk along the falls. The water gurgled underneath the frozen ice, and gigantic icicles lined the walls of the canyon! The photographs we took did not do it justice, it truly was breathtaking!\"\"We just happened to see the sign for the falls while driving and we were not disappointed , such an amazing view!\"\"Beautiful location in the summer, but also amazing in the winter with the frozen waterfall. Parking lot is plowed out in the winter. 30 km from Jasper, spend a half hour wandering around and enjoy the frozen falls. Stay on the pathway.\"\"If you're in the Jasper area, do yourself a favor and spend at least an hour to check out Athabasca Falls — it's one of the most beautiful places in all of Alberta!\"\"First of, it's free at this place. In fact, most of the places in Canada are free! This water fall is very beautiful, with loud thunder sound of the water running down crashing the rock. There's also a place where you white water raft for level 3 if you're an experience one. The natural rock formation is beautiful and to walk through it is quite a memory. Spend an hour or two and you'll enjoy the day.\"\"We stopped at Athabasca Falls on the way back to Jasper. It had been raining but stopped by the time we arrived. Because we left early, there was no one around and we had the place to ourselves. You can see our pictures at winenchocolate dot com\"We spent Sunday afternoon out at the Athabasca Falls. It was beautiful walking in the snowy area & seeing the magnificent falls. It was too dangerous to go to the lower falls.We went here on my Moose tour and i'm glad we did! It was a beautiful spot. We weren't here too long but we did a bit of exploring.\"If your looking for a quick day trip in Jasper that's convenient, beautiful and not to physically challenging then stop by to see the amazing waterfall at AthabascaEven more beautiful in the winter when it's frozen:)\"We did this hike in the winter so part of the trail was closed due to snow and ice on the stairs. This is a great little hike to stretch your legs on your drive along the Icefields parkway. It is very pretty.We had a awesome time walking down the trails to the river to take pictures looking back up the mountain. We have been in the fall and in the winter.\"A very busy place in early fall with many tourists. Paths are paved and fairly easy to navigate for all ages. More extensive trails can be accessed as well. A beautiful must-see attraction, however I prefer less busy times.\"\"If you want to experience the Rockies and their Falls this is a Great starting place. Easy access off of HWY 93, Beautiful scenery all the way to the falls. This is a great place to see in the summer and winter.\"My husband and I loved the Athabasca Falls. So amazingly beautiful and spectacular!! Lots of areas to explore with great walking trails. The water is like no where else. Beauty everywhere. Be ready with your camera and to be visually fulfilled.\"Beautiful views. We had the chance to raft down the Athabasca River (after the falls!) for about 10 miles. Not very scary, but the landscapes were beautiful and the guide was really knowledgeable.\"The waterfall is beautiful but the history of the falls can be seen by a short hike to the river's past channels gives you an unprecedented look back in time and see how water can cut and polish rock.This should definitely be on your must see list. Start with the falls and then head towards the canyon. You can take steps down and then you end up at the bottom of the falls after the canyon and it opens to a beautiful rock beach with views that are breathtaking. It's dog friendly and perfect for a photographer. We were also told it's one of the best places for star gazing at night. It's busy but we didn't feel overwhelmed and I would definitely go back if we were in the area again. It's on your way to reaching Jasper if you are coming from Banff or an easy 30+ minute drive from downtown Jasper. Enjoy!\"It was very beautiful. I went during the WInter and everything was frozen, but with the mountain in the background, it still looks and sounds amazing!\"\"Feel the the mist of spray on your face, view the rush of white water leaping down the canyon and listen to the roar of water crashing over rocks, plummeting down below the walking bridge. A great visit a short drive away from the town of Jasper, and directly on route from Jasper and Banff National Park. Stop and stretch your legs, take a bathroom break or have a relaxing picnic on a nearby bench,\"This is nature at it best and most wonderful. The walkways offer you so many different views of these magnificent falls.\"Gorgeous spot. This is a beautiful place for pictures, especially with the unique stairs built into the scenery. It was not crowded for me as we went right after a rain, but I can see how it would be a bit uncomfortable viewing with more people.\"\"The biggest canyon and waterfall I have seen! Superb!Quite accessible, mainly paved. Some areas inaccessible to those who cannot climb / scramble.\"\"This is a must stop when driving along the Icefields Parkway.The scenery & the power of the water is amazing.Very easy to walk around.Athabasca Falls won't disappoint.\"\"We checked out Athabasca falls while we were on vacation in Jasper in December. The scenery was amazing and the trails were well kept and easy to navigate. It was pretty awesome to see the falls , nature is pretty crazy. It was about 25 minutes from Jasper and we walked around for about 45 minutes before getting chilly and heading back to the car. Very pretty location, great place to check out if you have the time.\"The power of water amazes me. A must see if your visiting Jasper National Park. Extremely breath taking scenery.You must stop here when you are driving on the Icefields Parkway. The fall is very near the parking lot. We have seen a lot of falls in British Columbia and Alberta and we loved them all !\"Athabasca Falls are stunning, lovely walks and good paths. What spoils this area is the selfie stick tourist of which there were hundreds. They are not on the hiking path but in front of the falls not to take a picture of the falls but of themselves with a small amount of lovely blue water in the background. If you want to be shoved, kicked etc then that's the place for you! If you walk on you will find fewer people and equally stunning views.\"\"There are just SO MANY wonders of nature in the Rockies, that it is hard to even attempt to compare! This is one of those must-see attractions!\"\"This is a definite must-stop on the Ice Fields Parkway. The falls are enormous and create such a beautiful detail in the surrounding rock. Take all of the paths, there are different views all over. Paths are clean and easy to walk on. My favorite part was the small lake and basin after the falls. The water turns bright blue/green and all is calm after the falls. There is a long stairwell to get down to the basin with large steps and things to hold onto. Very touristy, go early in the morning when it's chilly to grab your photos.\"\"This was a gorgeous place to stop, and I'm so glad we did. Make sure to hike down too - you could spend a good hour here just enjoying the view - which we did.\"\"Worth a half hour stop, even in snow. Easy walk along pathway with fencing, beautiful views, spectacular falls\"\"If your driving the highway between Jasper & Banff, summer or winter, stop and see this place. There is some walking, but not very much, so most people can enjoy this place.\"\"Very impressive Waterfalls, Good Parking and not too far to walk. Bring Camera - Excellent viewing platforms.\"Second only to Niagra Falls this natural wonder is just plain fantastic. Easy to get to. Gentle walking trails. Plenty of parking and bathroom facility. Photographers are in their element with the landscape views and energy of the falls.\"Been 35 years since visited last. Wonderful view, able to appreciate the power of water/nature. Kids enjoyed the walk and the different view points\"Well worth a visit. Signposted from the road. Free parking. Takes around an hour overall. Powerful waterfall. Nice scenery.\"We have been to Athabasca Falls many times and it is always a treat to walk the trails. Standing on the bridge you have great views of the falls and it's great for picture taking. Despite the fact that there are signs warning people not to go over the fences there is always at least one fool who thinks the rules don't apply to them. On this visit there was once again a guy with a camera trying to get the best view, standing on wet rocks right at the edge of the falls. Obey the signs so you don't become a statistic!\"\"One of natures beautiful works.The falls are ordinary but the view is amazing once the falls flow down and cut through a gorge. The nice part from the visitors view is that U get to walk through the rocks and see the falls from different points. A history of the falls is written at the various points too, which is good information.The different layers of rocks, plants etc give the closest insight into the effects of erosion over hundreds of years. A commendable part was the singular toilet amidst the woods. I must say thank you to the Jasper tourism center for its provision in such wilderness. I took my 6 year old kid there and so had the closest look into one of the best accommodated toilets I seen. Sans flush, the WC runs at least a 100 feet deep into the ground! In all its wilderness, it was spacious, clean and with enough supply of toilet paper.\"This was a great place to stop. As well as the falls it is worth the effort to walk down the the bottom where te water flows into the river and to the pond.\"We stopped on our road trip from Calgary to Vancouver and although time was tight, we found the waterfalls would be worth adding to our next trip as a place to spend more time.\"\"Cool, cloudy day, a bit of rain here and there.....We enjoyed every second of our visit. Make sure you look up and down, go down the stairs, go down to the river edge, go for a walk by the river. Explore! You will not be sorry.Safe, well paved walk ways. Hold on to the rail at the more steep areas.\"\"Very enjoyable promenade. Magnificent views of the river, waterfalls, etc. Well indicated trails. Truly recomended.\"\"My husband and I from the UK have visited Canada several times over the years and I am always finding different things to comment on on Trip Advisor so this one is a long time coming.This is a stunning tourist spot, the first time we visited several years ago and on a revisit more recently. You cannot imagine the power of the water and the noise until you see these amazing falls. It is very accessible to able bodied and also to those that may not be quite so mobile so everyone is catered for to see this wonderful spectacle.Because of its popularity it can be very busy and quite crowded especially around the car park areas so be aware, and you do have to navigate crowds of people but it is worth it in the end. A must see, and one beautiful photograph I took is framed and on our wall at home, so every day, even in England we see these amazing falls!\"\"Gorgeous views, easy access paths. This place is very tourist-y which is not my favourite thing but the views are too beautiful to pass up! Disappointing how some people disrespect nature and feel the need to litter. Well worth the visit, though.\"\"Athabasca Falls are beautiful and an absolute must stop. I can't imagine coming all the way to Jasper and not stopping here. The Canadian Park Service did a great job designing and building the path system to accommodate all visitors no matter what their abilities. The signage was informative and easy to understand. Yes, I am sure that it can be very crowded especially in the summer. We were there on a drizzly day and it was not crowded at all. Maybe stopping in the early morning or later in the early evening would help avoid the crowds. Everyone in my family loved it .\"\"Since I love waterfalls, I had to add this attraction to the list. Lots of tourists but still worth visiting. Not far from Jasper.\"Incredible rock formations and good interpretive walk signage. Not too far from town so go see an amazing display of the power of water over time.Athabasca Falls are very popular. The trail is well maintained and an easy walk. Great for all ages.\"I absolutely *LOVE* waterfalls, but I hated this one. You park, walk through a maze of tourist buses, navigate hoards of rude tourists, none of which speak English, and the waterfall isn't even that great. Zero tranquility here. The tour guide drivers are also miserable to deal with- they'll shove you out of the way while a family takes 300 selfies. I walked down to the area closer to the riverbed hoping that maybe that would be more enjoyable, but it wasn't really.Do yourself a favor and don't stop here- Jasper has other, much better, waterfalls.\"\"i thought I had taken a wrong turn and was so disappointed that we'd missed the falls. Kids were tired and cranky, then I come across the sign to the falls -Yay! Kids said nah, don't worry - of course mum spat the cheque and said we didn't come all this way to miss this. Got grumpy 1 and grumpy 2 out the car upon arrival and they were completely amazed, such stunning views, awesome falls, amazing how calm the water can be, then turns into a raging fall, good little walking trail, seen a double rainbow over the falls as well. We were all very happy after that to continue our drive.\"\"These waterfalls are incredibly beautiful, would definitely recommend stopping here on the road to/ from Jasper. Lots of informative signs, pretty easy access to all areas, predominantly kid-friendly. Also saw two tiny dogs in tiny coats so if you are looking to see these then this is probably one of your best bets in Alberta.\"Not to be missed. Exceptional natural beauty. Carved by water and weather. Easy access and careful walking for everyone.\"Although not a high waterfall, the sheer volume of water means that it roars as it plunges into the deep, narrow gorge it has carved out over time. Allow at least 1/2 hour to enjoy and photograph the falls from the various platforms providing different views. It is only a short distance along a wide, flat path from the car park to the viewing platforms at the top so this attraction is suitable for strollers and wheelchairs.It is a nice little climb down the stairs, through the gorge to the bottom for a different perspective again.Strongly recommend making this one of your stops if traveling the Icefield Parkway.\"\"This is a very impressive Fall, not very far from the roadway, easy to park the car, a short distance walk is required, good for family trip. You can get real close to the fall and watch the water falling off the cliff. Nice view.\"\"Love these falls, so easy to get to just outside of Jasper, pavement access, wheelchair accessible. Well, worth the short walk. I went in November and had the whole place to my self. I walked up the river as well for more beatiful scenery. Nice place to stretch your legs and get some great pictures!\"I like that there were signs with information about the falls - a self guided interpretive trail made it more interesting. Good stop to make not far from town if you want to see something but don't have all day.Glad I had gloves and a beanie because it was -10 the morning out tour took us which make for sharp photos.Gets very busy with tour buses so go early but rug up and enjoy the thundering falls.Rained the whole time but still enjoyed the trails. The views were breath taking and it was still very busy considering the poor weather.Well worth a stop- pleasant stroll to various viewpoints of waterfalls and canyon of glacier blue water amongst leafy green vegetation.\"Being right beside the highway this is an easy and worthwhile stop. This is not a particularly high falls, but the water volume going over the falls is large, and watching the water thunder over the falls can be hypnotic. There are some short trails that take you to different viewpoints for different perspectives. Whatever you do, DO NOT climb over the fences for that \"\"perfect photo\"\". The rocks get slippery from all the moisture and spray, and people lose their lives here far too often by ignoring the fences and slipping into the falls.For most visitors, I'd recommend budgeting 20 or 30 minutes for this stop, as that's long enough to take in the views and admire the falls.\"\"near to the highway and accessible for all. great views of the falls from the bridge over the gorge or from closer when clambering down the paths. some of the path is a little worn in places now and slippy when wet, but great photo opportunities\"\"Beautiful falls, nice walking area. A must great stop along the way to other places. Can spend 30 minutes or hours depending on the day and what you want to do.\"\"There is a short walk from the parking lot to the falls, though it looks like you could extend the hike further.\"Very spectacular place to go. For me It's a must see place in Jasper. Very busy all year round. Bring your camera.This is close to the road and worth the stop if you're driving past. It does have a lot of visitors however and those that visit evidently aren't able to figure out what a rubbish bin is. It is scenic although there are many falls like it along the highway and amongst hiking trails.Very pretty falls which take about half an hour in total to visit each viewpoint. The force of water is very strong as the river plunges into a narrow canyon where the water then turns to a deep turquoise. The pathway and steps round the falls are very well maintained and signed. There are good barriers along the path which clearly state you must not climb over them. There is even a plaque which tells the sad fate of a boy who died. Yet whilst we were there several Chinese visitors still climbed over with their tripods to stand perilously close to the edge and in doing so in considerately blocked the view for everyone else. I asked them to move but they only did momentarily. Hopefully people reading this review who may be inclined to do the same might consider why it is not right to do so and refrain from doing so.Mind blowing and fantastic.. its such a wonder it just amazes me how beautiful it is in there the crystal blue water was impressive definitely a bucket list goal :)\"Athabasca falls are so beautiful any time of the year. It's a very short walk off the highway, you'll be pleasantly surprised.\"\"Found this falls to be one of the best on our entire trip, fantastic views. Very well presented in as much as many walkways with hand rails as required. I feel we benefitted by visiting later in the year as I can imagine this place could very easily become overcrowded.\"\"I could never get bored of seeing all the gorgeous glacial waterfalls and rivers in this part of Canada, but this was just amazing, if not one of the best we saw. This is situated at the Jasper end of the Icefield Parkway and really did set the scene for what was to come!There are plenty of information boards dotted around the site, which are quite educational for the whole family. The crashing waterfall with the mountain backdrop was breath taking, but the most gorgeous and serene part was down at the bottom, where the waterfall gave way to a quieter ice blue river. Although it was freezing, I could've spent hours there!\"\"This place was an awesome place to go hiking and to take some beautiful photos, I couldn't believe how long the hikes were, which was a huge highlight in my opinion. Some of the views are from high above so if you are afraid of heights it may be best to go with someone you trust.\"Athabasca was my favourite waterfall of the trip... & we did a lot of water falls! The key here is to look at it from all the angles.. The other side has a great viewVery scenic walk. More than one pathway to walk..take your pick.All trails are marked and accessible. Safety rails line most pathways..enjoy!One of the most beautiful falls that we saw during our trip. Close to Jasper town and easily reachable.After doing the Cavell Meadows hike we drove down Rt. 93a to Athabasca Falls at it’s junction with the Icefields Parkway. There are restrooms and picnic tables at the parking lot. The falls are right next to the lot. The Athabasca River narrows converging its waters to form a wall of water that flows over the falls and under a bridge through a gorge. There are great photos of the falls with snow covered Evelyn Peak in the background and of the blue green waters rushing through the deep gorge as the river continues on. Did this review earn a “helpful vote?We loved touring the falls. Two out of Five of us have disabilities yet we were still able to enjoy the falls by taking a shorter walk around the falls. Amazing views. Locd it.\"Definitely worth doing. Lovely mountain views in the background. We actually saw a mink while we were there. It can get busy, but worth the visit.\"\"Throughout our drive from Lake Louise to Jasper, this is the best place to go. The falls are really beautiful and we are lucky to visit it during a sunny day. However the washrooms are not very clean, so be sure to look out for washrooms whenever you can throughout your drive.\"\"Didn't expect ourselves to enjoy this stop so much after three days in Jasper. We planned make a stop here on our way from Lake Louise, but decided to delay the stop until the day we drive back to Yoho, and that was a good decision, as we would not have had enough time to spend time here on the way to Jasper. The walk to the lower canyon was a lot more interesting, with the colorful and interestingly textured canyon walls, the falls, and the river at the bottom.\"\"Once again, this country just keeps on giving with scenery, absolutely spectacular. The Athabasca Falls were amazing, so much to see and take in, I would recommend stopping here for a look on your trip.\"\"Beautiful thundering waters, try and explore the whole area as there are some lovely walks around that give different views of the falls.\"\"Just a great spot, easy to access and nice walks along the river and falls area. Picnic areas, toilets etc and the falls themselves not huge but beautifully interesting.\"\"A great place to visit. Plenty of room for all the tour buses and you. Beautiful in all ways. We saw it just after a new fallen snow and it was incredible, definitely a must see on this route. Much more impressive, in my view, than the ice fields. Oh and it's free.\"\"A must-see in Jasper! Be sure to take the walk down to the river. The place really reminds one of nature's power and beauty in its raw, unspoiled state\"\"This place is busy, but worth the trip. Nice falls, lots of water pushing through. Take the path down to the river, water is cold!\"\"The color of the water was amazing milky blue. The rock formations were intriguing and highly photogenic. It is best to stick to the paths and hold on to the handrails. If the ground is slippery, it is important to use good judgment and refrain from continuing if it feels unsafe or might be too much work to get back up.\"Spectacular falls easily reached from the road and then from the car park - several different short trails are all worth following for different views of the glorious falls and the surrounding country. If you're here you'd be foolish to miss.Easy walk in from the parking area even in snowy and slippery conditions. An extremely photogenic piece of nature and we'll worth the visitWe stopped here on our way to Banff. We spent about half an hour walking from the top of the falls down to the river. Was a really enjoyable stop. Great photo opportunities as well.\"They aren't the biggest or baddest falls, but they're pretty neat. If you take the time to read the plaques and boards you can learn a lot about the local area. What makes these falls so cool is the age of them and to see the eroded rock where the water has been flowing for many moons.\"\"We stopped here while driving through Jasper National Park, and this is a place you do not want to miss! It's simply an awesome example of nature's unique artwork. And it's right off the main highway!\"\"After going on the Maligne Lake Cruise, I still had enough energy to hit Athabasca Falls and what a Hi-light. I must have taken 300 pictures as I couldn't believe the colour of the water and canyon in the rocks that the waterfall had hollowed out. The walk down to the bottom was filled with picturesque views and I had my camera clicking at every turn. I couldn't believe how much there was to see and would recommend the trip to everyone old or young.\"\"Crazy busy place, full of tour busses. It's beautiful to see but I wouldn't want to spend very long there.\"We visited while on a tour out of Jasper. Its difficult not to take hundreds of photos in this area.\"Went here as part of the icefields parkway trip. Was beautiful lovely photographic opportunities. Time allowed not quite long enough, would have spent longer. We had 20 minutes there.\"\"I highly recommend this trip to anyone who visits Jasper, its a short drive from Jasper. The short hike to the falls is well worth it, I have visited the falls both in summer and winter and personally in the winter months I find the falls to be and their best.\"This is a must stop location along the Columbia Ice Parkway. Lots of parking and easy trails to explore the area. Count on spending at least one hour checking out all of the sights. Amazing to see how the water has carved out the rock over time.\"Didn't know what to expect, but nearly lost my camera when I looked down!!! That's friggin amazing! (Hope you know what that means?) An incredible natural demonstration of the force of water, and an unbelievable gift shop. A must see!!\"The falls were beyond awesome. The trails are clean and manageable and the vistas are beyond magnificent. A must see\"Stopped off on a Brewster coach trip to Jasper from Banff. Although the falls are not particularly large as falls go it comes from the Athabasca river, a fast flowing mountain river, with a spectacular backdrop of part of the Rockies. In the river there are twenty species of fish downstream but only one above the falls, such is the barrier. Worth a visit though.\"These falls are easy access from Icefields Parkway and are absolutely stunning. There are interactive signs to explain the history of the water flow\"This is off the road, but well worth the stop. Stunning falls, and a nice little hike for those who want to wander.\"Athabasca Falls are well worth a side visit on the way through with stunning scenery around every corner. The first part of the walk is fine for most abilities but the further down you go the further up you have to walk and it gets mighty steep in place especially if you take the route through the trees as opposed to walking back up the side of the falls.\"When you arrive, you don't know quite what to expect. The trail opens up more and more of the water rushing down this series of narrow passages through the stone. It is a special experience.\"\"There are a number of falls you can visit and should think they are better seen when snow melt is at its height or when frozen. Having said that, falls are free to view (assumed you have already purchased park pass) and information boards give you an idea about how the falls formed. Accessed by short walk from car park.\"Beautiful place to visit for a stop off and photo opportunity. Great scenery surrounding the falls. And gorgeous blue at the bottom. Must stop visit.\"Stop by here on your drive to Jasper from Banff. It's right off the Icefields parkway. Parking was limited in August. We didn't spend a ton of time here (about thirty minutes) and were able to see the falls and go on a brief paved walk, as opposed to actual hiking. There were lots of families here and dogs too!\"\"The falls are a must. Stunning scenery. Water falls thundering hundreds of feet to the river below. Well maintained walking tracks and stairs. Park notes regarding the history and creation of the falls very informative. This was a highlight of our trip to Jasper. The top of the falls has easy walking tracks, stairs for the fitter take you lower down to river level\"Great little place to go. Parking is close by so you don't have to walk very far. Worth the 15 minute pit stop for sure!\"Arrive really, really early. We got there before the first tourist bus arrived and had the place to ourselves. It is an incredible sight and amazing to see. I'm so glad I got myself out of bed to be there when I was.\"\"The rapids, waterfall and turquoise blue water cascading through the narrow crevice is really impressive and picturesque and well worth a photo opportunity.\"Amazing scenery and nice walk to the falls. A must see when you are in West-Canada. Much more recommended than the Athabasca Glacier which was very dissapointed.A sign from the highway easily points you in the right direction of the falls and it's an easy walk to the viewing area of the falls. They are thundering and are just beautiful. A great photo stop and it's free. Worth taking the time to stop.You can choose to do a range of hikes around here or just a quick stop as we didt o stretch our legs and see the falls. It's nothing spectacular.The Falls are easily accessible - an average walk from the parking on relatively flat terrain. Really enjoyed everything about our visit to the falls. They are really beautiful.\"We visited on a day which was cloudy and a little rainy and it added to the dramatic thunder of these wonderful falls. Definitely worth it to stop there for a while and marvel at what nature will do unaided if we let it! Unbelievably, we saw people risking their lives and going beyond the barriers to take photos although the dangers are pointed out everywhere. Accidents can and do happen because of this kind of reckless behaviour and it is not what anyone would want the Falls to be associated with.\"\"Called in on our way past and glad we did, quite busy but walk a short way as most visitors stop at the top!\"\"Please take the time to check out the falls. The unique trails are a must see. Not so great if you have a wagon or stroller, but a relatively easy walk\"\"Wonderful place to visit, specifically the canyon, about 10 minutes walking from the falls, it has beautiful stone rocks which carved by erosion millions years ago, this place is free of charge, you only have to pay the permit for Jasper national parks, worth to visit definitely\"Athabasca Falls is a short drive from Jasper that can be done in a morning. Paved walkways around the falls area make it an easy hike. Great scenery for picture taking.\"This is a paved, easy walk but there are some stairs. There are beautiful views of the rushing water. If you're short on time, avoid the path through the tunnel that leads to the canyon/pothole; left is where the action is. It's a popular stop for tour buses so it will likely be crowded.\"The walk to the falls was not difficult. The color of the water was a beautiful shade of blue. We recommend this to anyone.\"A must see if you are in Jasper! Has always been my most favourite place - the rushing water, the carved rock and the full spectrum of greens from the trees, grass, flowers and moss.Make sure you walk the full train to get views of the falls from all points. The paved trails are well maintained and very walkable.\"Beautiful and impressive. Just be prepared for bus loads of tourists elbowing their way to the best photo spots.There is a lovely easy walk to see the falls and the river. It is a beautiful area and well worth a stop to see it all.\"Literally! My words can barely begin to describe the beauty of this spot, located in Canada's Jasper National Park. A brief stop on Route 93 and within a short walk from the parking lot, is one of the more beautiful spots I've seen - anywhere! The turquoise water from the glacier melts in the Canadian Rockies, the river meets a narrow spot where you can see, and witness, the power of the rapids as they literally eat through the rock, creating a breathtaking sight. I've included a few pictures which barely show the power and majesty of the river and falls. I highly recommend this stop which is easily accessible to most everyone.\"\"Impressive waterfall that is easily accessible from the parking lot. There is a paved sidewalk around the falls viewpoints, as well as steps down to the lower canyon. I recommend going to the lower canyon which will take you to the river. You get a feeling of the rainforest with all of the green lichen on the rocks, the ferns and plants as you walk down the steps. Also take the sidewalk to the side view of the falls, which definitely looks different than the first view you get. The river is very wide here with beautiful mountains in the background; this backdrop with the rushing water of the falls makes for impressive photo opportunities. Warning: Do Not use the outhouse in the parking lot.\"\"Be sure to explore the falls themselves and surrounding viewpoints.The water color is amazing in this place and its a very short detour from Icefield Parkway, definitely a must for those driving through.\"\"A really pretty place to visit and take some photographs, plenty to see and very dramatic scenery. We were lucky enough to visit on a beautiful day and it wasn't too busy.\"\"The glacial water is truly amazing. The site is crowded with tour buses, so go early or late in the day.\"This stop doesn't take much out of your time and is well worth it. Beautiful waterfall and viewing points of the river along the way. Easy flat quick walk.This should definitely be part of your exploration of the Canadian Rockies. The fast flowing river gushes through the narrow gorges carving out narrow ravines and waterfalls.So easy to access these falls and such a fantastic sight. As everywhere we have been in the area the information boards provide exceptional insights into the flora and fauna and the history etc of the pace. If you drive the Icefield Parkway make sure you stop here. Just a short trip back from Jasper too.\"Allow yourself a good half hour to walk around the falls area, there is plenty to see. The falls themselves are fascinating to watch that amount of water charge through, and the walk to the Lake below is well worth it.\"\"We stopped at these falls for a short while on a coach tour from Banff to Jasper. Time constraints limited our visit to the top section of the Falls, where the river commences the downward path into the canyon to the lower falls and onwards. The width for the very large volume of water is constrained as it descends over rocks providing an impressive sight. As is the case at many of these good standard view points in Canada surfaced parking and clean washroom facilities are provided. The scenery is very good and warrants the short diversion from the main Icefields Parkway to reach the Falls.\"\"Part of the Banff-Jasper trip, but an experience in itself. Not too far from the carpark and paths reasonably walkable without too much up and down. Good views across the river to the mountains and then of the falls themselves.\"Lovey waterfall and worth the time to stop. Water is a great colour and the rock erosion is very interesting.\"Don't miss this site close to Jasper on way to icefields. Really enjoyed. Water is stunning blue. Good pathways, carpark, wc.\"its a waterfall very pretty but nothing much to do there apart from stop take a photo and move on . very cold so didnt stay long here not sure if there is a cafe nearby or notA lookout spot that is definately worth a stop on a road trip. The natural bridge is a wonderous sight and the water is so clear and blue. If you like natural beauty this is a must.This falls is one of the best so make time to stop. It is an easy walk to see all the areas and do take the trip down to the end where the view is different but very lovely.\"We arrived before 9am, way before all the bus loads of tourists started arriving. Moment of peace seeing the falls, and going down to the canyon when there was just a couple of other people around. Soon after >20++ people arrived by the busload and stomped the place. We were glad for the moment of peace and even gladder when the tourists left.\"We enjoyed the views throughout the trails and the scenic beauty is quite memorable. A great photo opportunity stop.This is another one of those stops that you don't want to miss when visiting Jasper. The views of the falls are lovely but don't miss the lower canyon...it's amazing! It's a bit of climbing both up and down but it's usually a fairly easy hike. More difficult if it's raining. Love it!Do stop at Athabasca Falls on your way to Jasper. They are stunning. It makes a really nice break in your trip. You can spend as much time walking around as you want but the Falls are well worth seeing.\"A short walk to the fall from the parking lot, it was crowded and a bit disappointed of the size of the fall.\"We went to the falls on the way to the Icefields Parkway. it was an easy hike and the falls are lovelyThis was another beautiful falls that we've seen on our trip! The one thing that separates this from many of the others is it's easy access from the parking area which for people who aren't able to take a long hike may be an advantage.\"Nothing much to see from the carpark and I thought \"\"another lot of falls\"\", but to my surprise, they were absolutely beautiful and worth the effort. Gentle walking tracks and certainly a good place to stretch your legs and breath some nice fresh country air.\"The falls are well worth a visit. There are a couple of short strolls around the short canyon and along the river. There is a trail that leads up and crossed the road and onwards to Geraldine Lake. Certainty worth a stop and a stroll around. Very popular and can get busy.\"An easy walk from the parking lot brings you to this amazing view. You can walk around and get some great shots if you're into photography, or just chill on a rock (hopefully under the sun ...)\"\"If you don't stop and visit the falls on your trip between Banff and Jasper, you missed a beautiful sight!Allow hour to visit, or more if you do the longer trails.\"\"Loved walking around this falls. Great place to spend some time.Easy walk with a lot of different views and sites to look at.\"\"We made a quick visit early, it is worth spending a little time here. Get here early because we were very soon swamped by many coachloads of visitors. did not spoil visit.\"\"The are lots of average to nice waterfalls on the road between Banff and Jasper. But this was the nicest Falls, lake and rock formations on the road to Jasper, bring your camera, stay one hour isn and enjoy\"\"Interesting place to visit when driving through the Icefields Parkway. Powerful falls, very impressive.\"\"A popular destination so be prepared for crowds and if you can go very early or late. An easy walk to the falls, people of all ages were there. Very beautiful with stunning rock formations.\"\"We saw many waterfalls on our journey, but this one and the surrounding canyons was just amazing! We spent a while there just listening to the thundering waterfall and then walking the pathways alongside the canyon walls as the water flowed through into a lake. The water was a beautiful shade of blue and was an even deeper shade in the canyon. To us, this was the highlight of the parkway and is not to be missed!\"\"I liked Athabasca Falls because of its pretty mountain backdrop and magical water colour. The falls itself that exciting, but it possesses enough power to carve a gorge immediately downstream of it. The gorge becomes deeper the lower into the canyon the Athabasca River goes.We were able to experience this waterfall by doing a very short walk along its extensive and very busy walkways and bridges. These paths skirt the gorge immediately downstream of the falls. You have views on both sides and some of the interesting geology of the gorge itself.I didn't do the walk that leads you further downstream deeper into the lower canyon. I was amazed at the colour of the water, a lighter blue and milky appearance. The color impressed us and adds to the waterfall's scenic allure. A protruding rocky island in the middle of the Athabasca River actually splits up the Athabasca Falls and as a result you are able to observe dual segments from the overlooks surrounding the falls. With a little luck you might see a faint rainbow in the rising mist of one of the waterfall.\"Part of out sightseeing tour of Jasper. Beautiful scenery and waterfalls as they flow down several levels and create bowls in the rocks. They weren't in full flow in August but when they are it will be spectacular.Stunning falls.. Short trek and easy to get to the falls. Beautiful and serene. Glad this was in the list of places we visited around Jasper.Worth the stop to take photos of these falls. Fed from Glacier melt so good water over the falls even in SeptemberWe stopped off at this attraction on the way to Jasper and almost skipped it. So glad we didn't! Amazing views and nice trails.\"Just a short detour off the Iceland Parkway are the beautiful Athabasca Falls. Promoted as small but powerful they are indeed a photographers delight. Within a very short walking distance from the main car park you encounter the wonderful Falls experience. A must see as you explore the amazing \"\"Rockies\"\"!\"The weather was pouring down but it was still worth taking a look at this beautiful spot. There's plenty of parking and toilets and some good photos to take. It wasn't busy either.\"If you are a fan of waterfalls you should definitely visit Athabasca Falls! Large parking place is available for cars, it´s accesible for all ages. I´d recommend to go there early in the morning to avoid crowds since it´s very popular atraction.\"\"This is a must see, don't forget you camera for this one. you will not be disappointed. The waterfall falls out from the side of the Mountain, and the views are breath-taking.\"\"Visit this place early (day break) and you have the falls all to yourself. Pack yourself a breakfast and you can enjoy the sounds of the water with your breakfast.Overall walk takes less than 30mins and entrance to falls very close to car park, no hiking required.\"These are really easy to see. It's only a short walk from the car park to the falls. There are a number of viewing points and a few information signs. This is a great place to spend an hour whilst driving along the Icefields Parkway (easy access from the main and scenic roads).Absolutely amazing Falls and slot Canyon. The pathways are abundant and offer amazing vantage points along the Canyon. I highly recommend this beautiful and powerful place.Definitely worth going in to. The walk is nice and easy and the viewing platforms were excellent. Would take the time.You have to visit the falls. It's obviously a bit of a tourist trail but well worth the visit. Not too far to walk\"This was a stunning visit and such an easy stop along the highway. There is plenty of parking with some coaches turning up too. We got there between 0930-1030 and it was fairly busy, we had got there just before a coach load. The falls have informative signs, but the power of the falls is incredible. Plenty of different areas to go to up close or at the end of the falls, which was the calm after the storm. Would highly recommend.\"Worth a quick stop enroute. Impressive waterfall & gorge. Plenty of parking although busy. Toilets are basic.Took my family who came from out of province to see the beauty of the falls. The falls are breathtaking and the colour of the water is gorgeous. You could stay there for hours just staring at them. This is a sight you don't want to miss.Dramatic and interesting and very accessible to all people. They have a wonderful system of ramps and viewing platforms including some steps down an abandoned stream bed from when the river moved. Really thoughtful and informative. We spent over 30 minutes climbing around and taking photos. It is Great!\"After seeing so many falls in Banff and Jasper, we were contemplating if we should do this at all with a 5 yr old but our decision to check this off the list was all worth it. It's a easy walk to the falls and the view is spectacular and you also get to see spot which might be a huge falls in about 100yrs. This would just take about an hour if you are just doing the falls.\"We stopped here on our drive from Jasper to Banff. It was breathtakingly beautiful... even in the rain! We had a nice walk to the various viewing spots. It was busy with visitors.\"The falls are pretty high and spectacular because of the volume of water and the narrow gorge it's pushed through. the falls are quite safe to visit, as long as you don't climb over the fence. They are also very accessible as they are only 100 meters from the parking lot and you can get very close to the falls. well worth a detour!\"A very nice high volume waterfall. Easy to get to with lots of viewing platforms. Would rate in top 25 of falls we have visited. In Canadian Rockies would rank it second only to Takakkaw Falls in Yoho Nat. Park.You pass close by between Jasper and Lake Louise - is a great free attraction - highly recommended for all ages and petsWould love to have spent more time here. Follow the river along and see the falls which were stunning and so close. The colour of the water is amazing - spend some time here.Can be very busy on the afternoon but worth the stop. Would recommend a look or hike around on the trails.Fun waterfalls to see. There are a lot of trails to explore not far from the parking lot. The falls were very powerful falling into the canyon below.Although we knew we were going to stop here for a photo stop whilst on a tour to the glaciers we visited separately and spent ninety minutes exploring. Spend time and this natural wonder will reward you.\"We had heard that this place gets really crowded so the advice was to get there early. We took this advice and were there soon after nine o'clock. However, there were already two coaches in the parking lot so the place was quite busy and it was necessary to push and shove in order to get a decent view of the falls. The Falls themselves are quite stunning with narrow channels full of rushing waters. The drop in level is not great but the sheer volume of water makes these quite exciting. But, oh the crowds, by the time we left there were seven coaches parked in the car park.\"\"The waterfalls was very full when we visited. Nice walk around the falls and canyon. Good photo ops.Can get slippery around falls when wet.\"\"We went to visit the falls mid day and it was a little busy, we were still able to get great pictures. I would suggest this attraction would probably be quieter in the morning. Very beautiful with many differnet great look out spots/photo spots. You can also walk down the old canyon where the water fall used to run.\"If you drive from south park way to Jasper you should not miss this one. It took about 30 minutes to visit this falls. Few view points are very close to the falls and you do feel its power. The trails and parking are crowds as well.lovely place to visit if you can get there before the crowds. worth getting up early for. good photo opportunityShort walk to a lovely waterfall. The river is beautiful and it looked like a great hike. A lot of viewing points.This is definitely one of the must see photo stops along highway 93. You only need a short time from your travel day.Well worth seeing on our trip around the Rockies. There were plenty of viewing platforms giving wonderful views of the falls.\"A must stop! The whole area is beautiful, but the waterfalls are just amazing! The volume of water flowing over them is truly awe inspiring!\"Athabasca Falls are beautiful. The color is amazing. There are different levels to view the falls and canyon. It was easy enough to get there and is right off the highway and a large parking lot.What a beautiful area! The trails and parking accommodate the crowds well. We took a picnic but wound up eating in the car as there really wasn't any place to sit.\"The falls are great, a narrow gorge with sheer rock and the green waters of the Athabasca River falling through them. The concrete walkways crossing the river give you great views of the falls and the River both upstream and downstream.Parking was tight, but we managed to park with no problems. There are restrooms.\"\"Nice short excursion to see the water falls, canyons, beach area and walk around. Walk was nice and gentle. Great place for pics!\"Close to the highway & a short walk from the parking lot. Numerous steps required to see the falls from several angles. This is one of the highlights in Jasper Nat'l Park between Jasper & the Columbia ice fields.The falls are impressive. There are two benches that memorialize two young people who slipped and fell to their death (on different occasions). Be careful.\"Every time we go to Jasper, we take a trip out to Athabasca Falls and it never gets old ... they are truly awesome! We usually drive the quieter highway from Jasper that can be found when you turn off to Edith Cavell. There are a couple of beautiful picnic spots along the way that are really quiet - we like the Meeting of the Two Rivers.\"Stunning waterfalls and would look fantastic in the winter when frozen. Well worth a visit. Would definitely recommend.\"Great instruction on notice boards and easy to get round, walkways provided amazing views of the falls but don't miss the view of the lower canyon from the road but mind the traffic.\"An easy walk to see beautiful falls high above gorges-takes about a half hour and right off the highway from Banff to jasper. Definitely include this on your trip!A short 25 minute drive out of Jasper will bring you to these falls. Although not spectacular by Niagra scale they are well worth a visit especially on a dull or rainy day.Stopped off here on the way to the glacier. The place was heaving so my advice is to go early as these falls are not to be missed. Around every corner is different view. Spectacular.Very close to the waterfall. Impressive to see the power of the water. Impressive are the potholes created by the falls over centuries. Nice walking paths around the falls.The color of the water and the depths of the canyon was breathtaking. There's lots of beautiful foliage and waterfalls.WOW. These falls were absolutely gushing. Beautiful easy trails with spectacular views. Don't miss this stop.\"Another natural attraction degraded by it's popularity. Roaring water, swirling azure pools and the occasional beer can. Close to the main road, and crisscrossed by boardwalks the accessibility is great but makes for it's on demise.\"The athabaska falls are great; there are several points to be walked around and hiked around which is fantastic. We had a great time exploring it all with the kid and ourselves. At the same time its a great way to spend the energy after a good breakfast in Jasper and have kids run around for a while.\"Great stop along the Icefield parkway just out of Jasper. Very short walk to falls, highly accessible from the parking area. Very much worth your time for a photo stop. Best photos taken in the afternoon to early evening.\"This place is worthy of a stop on any trip past! We kept running out of time and so bypassing it but then ended up extending our stay in jasper and heading down there and to then a couple of other spots. My two yr old thought it was awesome.Great place to check out when visiting Jasper with a baby. The paths to view the falls are stroller friendly and aren't very far from the parking lot (so it isn't a huge time commitment and you can get back to your vehicle quickly if baby fusses). Plus it is Soooo beautiful!\"During trip from Banff to Jasper we were subjected to rain, but the mountains were mainly still visible and although we understand good weather would have made it better it is hard to believe that itcoculd have been better. An awesome drive. We pulled in to Athabasca falls and when we approached the waterfalls the noise intensified and it was amazing to hear and see the force of the water. An awesome experience! Must do!\"It's a challenging bike ride or an easy drive.... if you rent a car your not on anyone else's time click to leavewe loved our visit here. Nature at its best and most powerful but why people ignore the warnings and risk their lives by going beyond the barriers is beyond me.\"We stopped at the Athabasca Falls en route from Jasper to Banff. The car park is just off the highway and the falls are only a short walk away, and worth doing. Very beautiful falls, lots of different vantage points, great photo opportunities. Thoroughly recommend.\"Beautiful and stunning. Many different viewpoints on site. Has lower and upper areas to be seen and of course mountains in the background.\"Love love the fall. Do not miss it. Beautiful, powerful and magnificent. Words and picture cannot describe it. You must not miss it on the way to experience it.\"This is a very cool place with a little bit for everyone. It's easily accessible for everyone and you can get very close up to the falls as well as the canyon. This is a must see for all.\"These falls are spectacular and you can get so close to them. A great reward at the end of the Icefield Parkway. Lots of options for overlooks. You can take a few steps to an overlook or hike around a bit. Also, the back road out of the falls off the main highway was a nice little drive and we saw a black bear along the road.\"\"This place is a MUST stop if you're in the Jasper area. I would recommend coming early or going late in the afternoon to keep away from the crowds and even then, you will not be alone. The falls area has a lot of viewpoints to look at and take pictures. You can even walk down a path where the falls used to go and look up at the giant carved away canyon walls. It is so picturesque. The falls are very close to the parking lot, so no long hike, but there are stairs you need to go up and down around the attraction. Make sure you have lots of memory in your camera for this place. We spent a good 45 to 1 hour just exploring all the view points and getting great shots. You could do it in less than an hour or stay longer. LOVE IT!!!!\"\"These falls are truly great. You got viewing points from all different angles. If you drive on the 93 highway than make sure to stop here. Take about a good 30 minutes to check out all the views.Enjoy!\"\"This is just off the Icefield parkway, and is an easy walk to several viewpoints of the falls, and channels the river has carved.\"Athabasca Falls is among the largest of the falls on the Jasper side of the Icefields Parkway. The falls are powerful and have carved quite a magnificent gorge out of the rock. Impressive to see and easy to get to (a short walk from parking). Can be slippery so wear good shoes!Absolutely beautiful but very cold. There is a very good cafeteria that does a very wide range of food from full cooked to light snacks.\"Popular falls and plenty of parking, but can be crowded. We were there early - about 9 am on a Sunday - and after about 30 minutes, the crowds started, so we had the best of the time. Access to the falls is easy and vantage points are many, to either admire them or to photograph them - and there was plenty of water. The falls aren't high compared to others we had seen, but they are well worth a visit and the walk around.\"Well worth a visit. Easy access and easy to move around and get good views despite large numbers of a certain type of traveller who always want selfie pictures and videos.Those annoying selfies stocks should be banned from all tourist spots as those operating them have no regard for others wanting to enjoy the sights and sounds!This is a majestic place........Not far off the road are the Athabasca Falls. If you enjoy watching waterfalls this is the place for you. A lot of water traveling through a small gap. Very dramatic! Well worth a visit.\"This is a very short trip off of Route 93. It is an easy walk, so kids shouldn't mind getting out of the car. It is another natural wonder in a beautiful environment.\"Picturesque stop with a small but pretty ferocious water fall. Great pics with the mountain in the background and enjoyed the various little paths to see different views and the river basin on the other side. Plus all the beautiful erosion of the rocks created by the water. Not overly crowded when I was on my tour but assume everyone will stop here on route through the Rockies.\"The Falls are right off the parking lot. The river has carved a sharp and fairly steep canyon. The hike to the lower falls may be even better, because you actually get a hike (really a walk) along the river to the lower falls just 3 KM down stream.\"\"Go early! It's a beautiful waterfall, just off the main highway, with a pretty good drop of water. The site has a large car park, and then you can walk around the falls and take in various views.There are lots of viewpoints and photo opportunities, and if you get the sunlight correct, you will get a beautiful rainbow shot over the falls. I suggest you go early or late....we went twice and its best when seen avoiding the crowds!\"\"What a beautiful waterfall! You see the first part of the waterfall. .....and then there is much much more to see! The river cuts through the rocks making many interesting canyons with swirling water and beautifully cut rocks! The walkway is quite level, athough if you are an older visitor, you would have to watch your step in a few places as the path is uneven. We have seen this waterfall in both beautiful weather and wet weather, but it is definitely worth seeing in ANY weather!\"Travelled from banff to jasper. The volume of water over the falls us amazing. Walked through a chute in the rocks that the river had made. Not to be missed\"Went there as part of a photography tour with Philip Norman Photography, Australia. This wonderful waterfall is very easily accessible and wheelchair friendly. It takes about 20minutes to walk around. Good place to take photographs. Aust go visit tourist attraction.\"This was one of our many stops in the Jasper National Park. We certainly weren't disappointed taking many photos. The weather wasn't great so the water didn't look as blue as the advertised photo shows.\"This is a great stop off along the Icefields Parkway. The falls are only a short stroll from the parking lot, and are an amazing sight. There are info points along the way, telling you about the history of the falls, and how they were formed. Plently of toilets available too!\"A stunning sight with water that has an intense blue that needs to be seen to be appreciated. We saw this on a tour with Brewster's from Lake Louise. Our guides marl & Lyndon were very helpful and assisted us to make the most of our experience.\"If the sun is out, then the light isn't so good for photos in the morning. Also, you might have to share your viewing experience with a number of coach parties on their way down the Icefields Parkway from Jasper.We were there at 10am in mid-September, and the sun was just getting up above the mountain; it was quite chilly!Well worth seeing, even so.\"Dramatic falls. Easy to view. Lovely shapes worn in to the rock by the most beautiful blue water. Loved it.This was a large falls with almost as much water as Niagara Falls. They had guardrails and nice paved paths to walk all around and see everything. Well worth your time to see this.\"I always love these falls absolutely beautiful, many many picture opportunities. They have done a wonderful job allowing for a lot of visitors, taking pictures plus keeping them safe. It is always amazing to me the amount of water that goes over the falls. When in Jasper this is a must to see.\"These falls are a unique blend of geology and water. The access is easy and safe as long as you stay on the path. If you don't you could die as did st least two young men whose memorials seem both sad and tragic.You have to visit them on the way through. Only a short walk from the car park. Beautiful against the mountain backdrop.You can not miss this stop... A short walk from the parking lot.. Pit toilets and picnic tables too.Absolutely stunning and spectacular. A thrilling experience and easy to walk around. Very memorable and could have spent much more time there...Get here early if the weather is good as the carpark is not too big and fills up early. Falls are just a short walk from the car park and you get great views from lots of different angles. Bring your camera.\"Wow! Tantalizing, Breathtaking and Gorgeous! A must see attraction! You will not be disappointed. Once you are done visiting the Banff Gondola, and Lake Louise, this is an attraction you cannot miss in Jasper.\"This is a fantastic stop for anyone in the area. I very short walk brings you to the falls. They are truly beautiful. There is a relatively short hiking trail that takes you along the gorge to the mouth of the river. I recommend the extra half hour for some nice photo oops.

There's no way to avoid the crowds here (unless you go between 2000 and 0800) - certainly worth seeing, but there will be crowds...\"\"Unfortunately it was a visit with torrential rain, but even then a beautiful sight with the mountains in the background\"\"Wonderful location, fantastic scenery, although it was snowing when we visited. I would recommend visiting the falls.\"\"The last waterfall of the day, but great to see it channeling its way through a gorge, and see both above and below the fall\"\"I would recommend stopping to view these falls.we had our little 2 month old with us, so we brought a stroller. had to carry up and down a few stairs but mostly flat ground, easy to push stroller around.\"The Athabasca falls is a must; take the walk to the canyon down to the river. I was soo happy and impressed that we stopped at the falls twice. Once while going towards jasper national park and again while driving back at the Banff. Its an Absoulte must.I discovered that anything with Athabasca in the title is awesome!! The view of the falls with the mountains in the background is spectacular!Enjoyed these falls. Great photo opportunities. Spent couple of hours in the area. Would recommend Athebasca included on anyone's itinerary.This is a must see. Beautiful aqua marine water spilling over a deep gouge in the rocks. Many places to enjoy on their well done paths. We were even there in the rain but it didn't spoil anything. It's just off the Ice Fields highway so very convenient going or coming from Jasper. Best views are at the top viewing points.This is a mini Niagara Falls in a much better setting. And not as crowded either. Lots of different nooks and crannies to explore. Amazing! Do not miss it.Visited these falls as we were travelling from Banff to Jasper. They were stunning and well worth the stopWhat can I say but beautiful wonderful powerful sensational memorable and much much more ... it is a must see at least once in your life :)\"Had a walk around the Athabasca Falls and the scenery, like Jasper National Park, is simply stunning.\"This was an excellent short stop close to the road.

You can also see the river and pot holes as well. Quite impressive.This stop was definitely worthwhile. There is a bit of a walk to get to the falls but it was worth it.\"Quick short detour was well worth it. Spacious and beautiful in the sunshine, lots of photo opportunities.\"\"Nice place, free of charge, easy acces, nice view. Close to jasper and accisble to everyone. A place to see.\"\"Was here last in October 2015, but have stopped here many times and the sounds of the falls never gets old.

Walk all the routes, see all the views and take lots of photos for great memories.\"Pretty falls. The site is all paved and easy to navigate. The water is such a pretty blue. I suggest you take the short jaunt down to the river for a sideline adventure.\"Athabasca Falls is a beautiful sight not to be missed if you are in the area. The trail around the falls is stunning, as well as the steps down to the base where you can see the river. Do not miss this place!\"\"Athabasca Falls were beautiful. There were several viewing points along the very accessible trail. There were a few steps from the parking lot, so not sure if it was handicap accessible, but the falls are a short walk from the parking lot so there is no hike involved. With this accessibility also comes the crowds. Lots and lots of people trying to get pictures and such, so you will deal with a large amount of people, but definitely a place to stop and see. The power of the water is cool and there are several walking paths along the falls, canyon, and river. Nice place to spend 30 minutes to a couple of hours, depending on what you want to see.\"Stopped off at the falls during our coach trip from Banff to Jasper. A pleasant short walk from coach park to the falls which are properly safely protected by stout paths and railings. A nice roar from these for your videos !\"A must see. Awesome. If you like roaring water and large fabulous rocks you need to come stand, look, inhale, listen, and experience the power of nature that is Athabasca Falls. Have been here three times. Can't visit Canada without my fix of these falls. A must.\"I was in awe to watch the tons of waters soaring down crazy and so much fog was generated when the water hit the rocks. it sounds like thunder! You can feel the power of the nature!\"Free falls, takes a few minutes to walk down from the car park but it's a nice way to spend a few minutes and take a few pictures\"\"One might consider that anyone who has travelled to Philippines (the land of 7107 islands) with its hundreds of fairly easily accessible waterfalls might be 'jaded' by a non-tropical, Canadian waterfall.Not the case.Athabasca Falls is attractive in its own right with a fast flowing ice blue river and a gorgeous drop complemented by a beautiful gorge-like setting.The viewing areas are very good although the timber railings appear not to have had sufficient maintenance by Parks Canada or the other responsible government authority.The falls are only a 60 metre walk from the car park off the Icelands Parkway, so they are quite accessible.Even the disabled can easily view parts of the falls.\"Don't miss! Incredible falls right off the highway near Jasper. The trails around the falls are easy and the water is just incredible.\"We visited this place first thing in morning while on the way to Jasper from Calgary. Since we were early, found the parking spot easily and then it's a 15-20 mins short hike to the lower falls. The way is mostly paved and we were able to use umbrella stroller on most of the path. The best part is viewing the falls from the little cave - that's a very beautiful experience. When we reached near to the falls, there were 6-7 people ahead of us, standing in queue to enter the cave. And when we were returning, there were about 20-25 people in the queue. I would recommend going early or in evening to enjoy the place.\"Trails running up and down the falls give great views from different vantage points. Plan on spending some time there and enjoy.These falls are awesome and is well worth the little drive from Jasper.

Try to go early to avoid crowds\"\"Right off the ice field highway, this is a good rest stop with something to see. The falls were raging in September. I can't imagine how they would look in late spring- early summer!\"\"Very nice and impressing.Few minutes walk from the parking lot and you get to the falls.Clean and nice.\"Lovely walkways all around so you can see the falls from all different angles. Tracks for walks. Lots of steps if you want to get to some areas. Free car park and loos. Good waterfalls.\"This requires a short visit as you travel down the Icefields parkway. Count on 30-45 minutes.The falls are spectacular, but even more interesting is the little footpath that leads through an old abandoned river channel to the bottom of the falls. Certainly a worthwhile stopping point.\"Best falls and viewing points in whole area. So incredible. Easy walking. Ok for wheel chairs also. Could easily spend an hour here.\"Stop by the falls if you're not pressed for time. I wasn't super impressed with them because I've been to Niagara falls and the ones in Hamilton, Ontario. The plus side is that it didn't take long to see and didn't involve much walking or hiking to check out. I would say this place is kind of overrated.\"\"This is a great area to walk around - the falls themselves are rather interesting. This is one of the stops on the icefields parkway that has bus parking, so count on a lot of people running about small pathways near the falls. There are pathways that lead away from the main falls and follow the river - this is where a bit of tranquility can be found, and quite recommended.\"\"As waterfalls go, these were great. There was an easy walk around the top of the falls, with plenty of viewing places.\"The falls are really close to the carpark and access is easy for old infirm and those who want to enjoy something that's very good.\"Gorgeous views and a short walk so very easy to get to and to take some wonderful pictures.

Downside crap maps for visitors.\"It's a super drive all the way, in fact it's beautiful anywhere and everywhere you drive around in Jasper.\"\"To be honest, this is the place I love most! whether you are looking for scenery or a short hike, Athabasca falls caters to all. Just standing by the fall, and feel the fresh water sprinkling on your face is sheer pleasure. We captured some very good pictures there. We walked around the short hike and it was a fun activity as a group.At the end, there is a stairs that leads to near the calm water collected at the bottom, and it is like a calm backwaters there. There are big rocks, so feels more rocky, but it is still beautiful. Everything about Athabasca is inviting, and as someone who has already visited 3 times, I must say, it leaves you craving for more everytime\"falls is few minutes walk from parking area with viewing decks that get crowded. spend few minutes walking down the river and be amazed by the carved rocks where the water used to flow.Stopped at the falls whilst driving the Icefields Parkway from Jasper to Lake Louise. There is a good sized carpark with facilities and it is then a short walk to the falls. It is free to see them and there are various viewing platforms and bridges etc to take photos from. If you are short of time do these falls and miss out Sunwapta Falls. Give yourself a min of 15mins but to soak up the experience 45/60mins would be better.Even on a cold miserable morning outside could not dim Majestic Beauty and Rush of adrenaline one takes away from this experience. Mother nature must have been working overtime. It would be great if you could time your visit to avoid a busload of tourists were obstructing your views. Even that still makes it well worth your visit and time to see such a beautiful waterfall.\"This is a pretty falls with paved sidewalks and interpretive signs. Not a hike and close to the road but its pretty, worth a stop.\"\"A perfect stop to get out and stretch your legs and enjoy the scenic beauty on the drive to Jasper. The waterfalls were forceful and a very easy walk from the parking lot. For those interested in seeing a bit more, there are stairs leading down to the calmer river front below.\"\"Nice place to stop and stretch your legs, have a little bit of a walk and explore the falls and gorge. Going all the way down the hill gives a calm back eddy and rocky beach where you can soak your feet in the icy water if the day is hot. Does tend to be quite busy with a lot of people stopping though, we had some trouble finding parking.\"\"You don't need more than about 15 minutes max to see the falls, but they're definitely worth a visit. Water. Falling. So long as you don't expect more, you won't be disappointed!\"\"The force of the water here is pretty impressive. At the time of our visit it was not over crowded. It is a good stop on your way between Jasper and Lake Louise. Our photos looked terrific. Blue sky, mountains in the back drop and some pretty impressive water falls.\"We visited athabasca falls on our trip to the Rockies. It was a cloudy rainy day so it was a good excursion from Jasper. We had done white water rafting the day before from the bottom of the falls do it was an opportunity to see what the driving force was behind the raft!Great free trip out for a couple of hours or so from jasper.This was a lovely place it was nice to see how the water had changed the rocks and there was no charge to see this mother nature at work\"Just a short walk, but was stunning.

It has paved walkways and lots of great viewpoints. It is fun and affords great photo ops.It is quite well worked with the ability to see the falls from both sides and a bit further down river. Nice place to break a journey and it has all the facilities.You can see a permanent rainbow form at the head of the waterfalls - the mist that is created because of the force of the water is truly amazing.

It is easy to find, there is a large parking lot,there are several viewing areas with sturdy railings, but there are steps to navigate to some areas.\"\"We called here on our first day in Jasper, its a beautiful walk where you get an insight into the history and different formations etc. The walkway gives you plenty of closeup photo opportunities and its spacious even when crowded!\"\"I agree with most of the other reviewers that this place is very beautiful, but can also get very busy.

There are nice trails to walk. Would recommend a visit if you are in the area\"Natures raw energy on display. Nice foot paths lead you from one viewpoint to another.Getting there early doesn't mean you will beat the bus hordes\"Good tourist's attraction. I would recomend it if you have extra time or it is on your way to Jasper or Banff. Takes about 20-30 min to explore whole area.\"The Athabasca Falls are on the upper Athabasca River in Jasper National Park and worth a stop. The Falls were impressive.

Viewed from just about any angle, they are interesting and mesmerizing.\"\"A really nice hike and beautiful to see.I would recommend highly to see it its very pretty. Good experience for family trip\"\"Beautiful Falls, Nice trails on either side of the Falls. Stairs that take you to the river/lake where we saw people tube boating.\"\"What an awesome view of fast running water. It cascades over the rocks, spraying cold glacier water up reminding you of how cold the water actually is. There are memorial benches reminding you of how unforgiving the falls can be. Not a place to miss on your travels.\"\"The falls are really nice, with quite a few viewing areas, so even when there are a lot of people there are many places to view the falls and the rocks that have been carved by the river. The various colours of the mosses add so much to the scenery as does the colour of the water as it rushes on its way. The falls are very close to the road, and well worth the visit\"This is amazing beyond words. We thoroughly enjoyed the short hike down and the beautiful falls. It is more than just looking at the falls and hiking up. There are so many beautiful areas.\"This was beautiful and a must see! The force of the water is hard todescribe. There are several viewpoints for this we did 1-4. Some incline but great trail.\"\"The roaring water, the long tumbles, the whirlpools creating sculptures in the rock, and the channels that you can walk where the water used to go all lend themselves to a chance to see the power of nature at work.Truly a great place to spend a bit of time, and be amazed at the amount of water that can move through in a matter of minutes.Great for all ages and abilities\"Keep that in mind as I rate this. It is great to watch the water flow to the fall and then turn into a roaring tumult as it heads down. Just avoid being distracted by the idiot tourists who want that wonderful picture in the most unsafe way over the barriers and on the rocks. They should get cameras with a zoom function.It's only a short walk to the fall from the parking lot. One of the wonders of nature shapes through times. We were lucky to see rainbows even. You can enjoy the fall from different view points with impressive feelings.\"first stop from the north entrance of jasper national park, the fall is not so big but we can look at it so close and from different angles, left and right, up and down, crowded stop\"\"It is a pretty waterfall, typical of the area. there are 2 viewpoints and both are easy walks. Not much more to say.\"Wonderful falls with thunderous sounds of water carving out the canyon below. Very good vantage points in which to view the action. You don't need to spend a long time here but it is special.\"Nice trail around the falls. Views fantastic. Not the best facilities though, but what do you expect in the Rockies.\"Falls were really great. Right off the highway so didn't require a hike to get to although you could hike further around than we did.It's easy to pull off the highway and take a quick look at these beautiful falls. The falls are located south of Jasper.Visited as part of a tour from Banff to Jasper. Nice un-spoilt falls so if you are passing do visit!\"What a roar and thunder these falls make... You cannot be other than impressed. Make sure to take the walk down the lower canyon and mind the sites remembering those who did not follow the instructions and slipped on the wet rocks...When driving in from Jasper take the 93A, when going to Jasper do the same, it is a beautifull peace of road.\"Great view and look outs.... Beautiful pathways to see upper and lower falls. Worth the stop for sure :)\"Worth a stop, nice viewing points and pathways. There were good information boards that explain the geology and vegetation. Nice place to stop bet even Jasper and the ice fields.\"\"A short walk from the parking lot, we could hear the roar and then see the spray around the water as we approached the falls. There is a sidewalk/platform on both sides of the falls, with wonderful views all around! We saw it on a cool sunny morning, with the sun streaking thru the evergreens and mountains in the background. The water is a foamy white going over the rocks exemplifying the utter force of the falls! It's a captivating site and well worth the short side trip from the highway to see!\"\"The good thing is that it is really easy to see these falls- it's right off the highway. The bad thing is that it's really easy to see these falls- so the parking lot fills up almost immediately. If you're going- plan to arrive early, or late. Don't recommend mid afternoon.\"\"Beautiful falls but not really aHiking area. More drop in and take pictures and leave. Worth the stop but don't expect to hike.\"The falls are beautiful. I highly recommend walking upstream or down stream to avoid some of the crowds yet still enjoy the falls.The place was packed when we went! So be prepared to wait a while for that perfect photo / selfie moment. The water rushes over a narrow canyon carving out the mountain - you can really feel the power of the water blasting through. There is a nice bridge over the falls.\"These Falls are a must to see!Not far off the main highway, washrooms, seating for relaxing , unreal positively majestic!\"\"This waterfall is really accessible, and requires no hiking. The site has well developed walkways and platforms for viewing the falls from different perspectives. A must see if you are in the area.\"This area is something you should not miss if you are driving from Jasper to Banff. Just pull off at the sign and walk a short (less than 5 minutes) from the parking area to see the beauty of the Athabasca Falls.\"Loved going to the falls. Make sure you have your camera, there is something about water falls that a person must capture!\"\"This is a awesome sight that you must see. The trails to get around the falls are well designed and easy to get around. Great place to get some great photos. There was a many warnings for safety reasons. Apparently every year a life is lost here due to people not following the rules. We saw a little memorial there for someone who had lost his life. Pretty sad to see a young Asian lady climb over the fence to have her picture taken. Later I saw her getting into her car and I was embarrassed she was from my home Province MANITOBA. She totally disrespected the warnings and the memorial for the person who lost their life there. I don't understand why some people feel they don't have to follow the rules. It's behaviour like that that can end up in tragedy and ruin it for the others . One wrong move or slip on those rocks and you would be ground meat. The power of that water needs to be respected . Note to others , when visiting anywhere respect the rules that are in place.\"\"I like Maligne Canyon more than Athabasca Falls. To see the canyon, we need to walk some distance, while the Athabasca Falls are almost right in front of you after you leave the parking lot. There were some people water rafting which looked like fun. If it is a sunny day, you should book it ahead in town.\"\"Well worth a visit - these falls were not the biggest we saw on our Canada trip but they are accessible and the water eroded rock is easy to see. It is also well worth walking down to the bottom of the falls, through an old river bed - so you really see the effects of water erosion.The down side was that, since the access is good there were lots of people - don't expect exclusivity.\"\"Breathtaking views of the falls and amazing canyon structures too. We visited Maligne Canyon and viewed the first 4 view points as we were short on time. Maligne is beautiful too but if you have time to just do either, I would suggest these falls as they offer both the water and canyon views and it is very close to the highway.\"I thought it was a small area to watch a small fall but it is so much more than that. Once you visit and go a few steps down you really enjoy the beauty of the falls along with the canyon like formation around the area. Go all the way down to the edge of the water and enjoy another view (looking up). Some parts are very slipper and very narrow so make sure you have shoes with grip.\"We stopped with the kids on the Icefield parkway to the Athabasca Falls and this is one of our favourite stops !Secure area with kids, short walk to stunning sceneries! Don't forget to charge your camera or phone to take amazing pictures!\"\"We visited Athabasca Falls as the last stop-off on our journey along the Icefields Parkway from Lake Louise to Jasper in August.Recent rain and snowfall had maximised the volume of water flowing into the falls, and on our visit they were spectacular. The violence of the water pouring through the small falls gap was a sight to behold. There are lots of good viewing points on both sides of the falls, so that you can see them from all angles.Very highly recommended. A must if you drive the Parkway.\"We stopped at the Falls on our way into Jasper. It's easy to access from the highway and beautiful views everywhere.these falls attracted many visitors - so try and go early to avoid the rush. Very picturesque with plenty photographic oportunities.We loved spending time at these falls - the rushing water really makes you realise how powerful the falls actually are. Great photo opportunities too!Walked along the entire track from top to bottom and had a great time Great view great falls a very interesting place to visit. Nice afternoon or morning walk as the sun is hot during the mid day when trail opens out.\"A short walk, and nothing strenuous. Some nice areas to walk around and see the falls. Definitely worth the stop!\"Impressive natural waterflow with great vantage points. Nice to get to the river at the bottom of the falls.Just a short stop but worth it to see the volume of water. Not the most dramatic but close to it. Restrooms available and plenty of parking space on the day we were there.Be prepared to be wowed by the fantastic Athabasca Falls. Mother Nature in all her glory will surely leave you feeling amazed.\"A short drive south of Jasper and easy hike along the trail gives a great view of the roaring Athabasca Falls. I am impressed with how the Canadian parks insure quality trails and sturdy bridges on their trails and walkways. Here you see several vantage points for viewing and photos. The falls are impressive for their wide powerful rush of water over the rocks, not sheer height. Definitely worth a stop on the Icefields Parkway drive south of Jasper.\"\"It is a beautiful set of falls, all on a paved path. Very short, I had expected a lot more of a walk. Falls are right off the parking lot, walking down to river is also very short walk. Cool to see! Disappointed with length of activity\"\"There is something about these falls. I loved them. Its a short walk from the parking lot.The picture water, its force, color and sound will remain with you for ever\"This is popular especially if buses are there. Don't despair. Give it 15 minutes and the waterfall views clear out. There are several areas to visit while at the falls. Take them all in. You can easily spend under an hour and see everything. Viewing the other areas at the falls will also be quieter. Most people cluster at the falls viewpoint and don't explore the other areas. The waterfall force is extremely strong. You are very close to the falls. Do not cross the railings and keep an eye on your children.\"This waterfall is on the road from Banff to Jasper. It is definitely worth pulling off the road for. There are several overlooks. Make sure to walk around the area and look for the best camera shots. There are usually lots of people here, because it is an outstanding place. Just be patient and you can work your way up to a great picture-taking spot.\"The falls are beautiful with interesting Rock formation. The car park is 10 min walk from viewing platforms. There is a good network of viewing platforms linked by bridges allowing you to see different aspects of the waterfall and walk to the river floor. We spent about 40 mins there.\"Been here a couple times over the years, and honestly even on the rainiest of days it is astonishingly beautiful. Don't miss your chance to walk around this area!!\"This water fall is not far from the town of Jasper. The waterfall is amazing and the canyon that the water flows through once its gone over the falls is a masterful piece of are created by nature. It is a must see while in Jasper.A short detour off the highway lead us to this beautiful spot with some walking trails if you wanted to spend more time. Great photo opportunity\"The falls a worth a visit we we re driving past and went in , glad we did not miss the falls. The way the water has eroded the surrounding rocks is awesome\"We spent about an hour at the falls enjoying the warm weather.awe The mighty Athabasca never fails to impress as it tumbles over the falls. Plenty of opportunities for good pictures and a nice place to stretch your legs.\"part of a package with trafalgar tour. amazing sight and sound, block out time to enjoy, explore and visit the bridges over the falls. we were very rushed on the tour. would have liked to have been able to \"\"soak it in\"\" a bit longer.\"\"We just visited the Athabasca Falls recently and this is a beautiful site to see. Make sure and walk around the whole thing! Its is so pretty to see the canyon. Love it here, it is so peaceful.\"We took a little family trip to Jasper and went to Athabasca Falls. So very beautiful and definitely worth going to see\"These falls are much hyped in the area but though quite interesting are not terribly dramatic, so don't expect Niagara. Pleasant walk suitable for less mobile visitors.\"Pretty interesting and dramatic falls for something that's very easily accessible. Definitely recommend stopping here for a few minutes if you're going by. It's worth a trip there even if you're not.Lovely view point of the falls and has good parking area and also washrooms. There was a lot of people while we were there\"The falls are breathtaking. Located about 30 minutes from Jasper. The main outhouses were gross, but if you go to the end of the parking lot there are another set that were cleaner. I am surprised no tourists fell to their deaths here in front of us, as some people were in the out of bounds areas to get their picture taken. Yikes!\"Be sure to stop here. Just beautiful location and very interesting and easy walk to and around the falls.Awesome. Loved it completely. There is a nice easy walk around the falls. Highly recommended if you are in Jasper area my 3rd favorite destination in Jasper national park. First being Mount Edith Cavel hike and second Malign Hike.\"Just beautiful. And the rock formationsare gorgeous. Just amazing what Mother Nature creates. Definitely worth stopping& seeing this. It's only about 30 minutesor so outside of Jasper in the way to Banff\"\"We have now visited the falls in all four season, Will they were super strong with the spring melt, frozen in winter and now most recently in summer. They were awesome to see every time. The walk to the falls from the parking lot is quick and easy, even with a stroller. Make sure you go to all the different viewpoints and walk the trail all the way to the end as there are a great variety of different ways of looking at the falls and Canyon. Totally worth a stop as you travel through Jasper Park.\"While in Jasper it's a must to make a visit to Athabasca Falls. It's free to check out and you can spend a good half hour to check it all out. The views and photos are amazing and definitely worth to observe and soak in. It can get a bit busy so the off season might be better.Arrived super early on journey from Jasper to Banff only 2 other cars in the car park. Weather was dull and although falls were good to see others we have seen (Mistaya and Johnston Canyon were better). We're only there 5-10 mins. Falls are quick easy walk from the car park.Great stop on the way to or from Jasper. It takes about a half hour to see all aspects of the falls. Well worth the time. There are information areas along the path that tell you about the falls and the flora and fauna.\"If you're travelling through, you simply must stop at Athabasca Falls. Stunningly beautiful. Lots of parking available, plus a few short trails to walk.\"\"During warm or hot weather days, the trails and photo spots can be very busy. Try to travel earlier in the day. Best time I have found to travel here is late April, early May or the Fall before the snow falls.\"\"These falls will always hold a magical place in my heart. Between the thrill of danger looking at the rocks above the falls and imagining what it would be like to travel the rushing water along the canyon, this place has a quiet energy that will rejuvenate you.\"\"close to the highway, great potholes and massive amount of water. Not a long walk but very good views. Take time and check this out.\"\"We stopped to look at the falls and went for a nice walk all the way to the bottom. Very beautiful, but busy spot.\"\"My wife and I enjoyed our stop at Athabasca Falls. It was fairly busy but not overwhelming. We took time to enjoy the views, take some pictures and read the several plaques describing the falls, river, rapids and some of the history surrounding the site.\"As with a lot of the spots on the Icefield parkway the downside is the limited area for parking versus the number of tourists stopping. Allow about 30 minutes to explore the area where the raging waters has worn away the rock over the centuries.30 km from Jasper is Athabasca Falls. It is right off the Ice Field Parkway ( Canada 93). This is the most voluminous falls in the park and the 80 foot tumble into a narrow canyon is a must see. The park has done a great job providing you safe access for optimal viewing. So enjoy and don't forget your camera.\"What a beautiful experience! Great stop along Highway 93! Great opportunity for pictures, with many different places to stand.\"It is not far off the road and you can walk to it. The water that rushed down from the glacier area was absolutely breath taking. Don't miss itWe stopped off at the falls on our way from Banff to Jasper. Very impressive and well worth a look. Take a trip down the river aswell if you get chance. Great fun for all.\"To see power of nature, please see Athabasca fall. Myself and my family enjoyed the fall very much. I strongly recommend to visit this fall\"\"This is an impressive site. The torrent of water rushing thru is amazing and the overall viewing is impressive. It is a must see, don't pass it by!\"\"A must see stop in the mountains! Such a beautiful wonder - a little touristy, just because it's a beautiful spot so there was a ton of people when we went, but still a must stop.\"\"Stopped here on our way to Saskatchewan crossing. I loved the informative plaques, teaching about the waterfall and erosion. The paths are well kept and easy to navigate. My only complaint is against the people that choose to vandalise such an amazing natural wonder.\"\"Visited on a trip From Jasper to Banff, just a short detour required. A short walk to the various viewing areas both sides of the falls on good paths.The water has cut a path through the rock making a huge whirlpool as it goes, very impressive. The river above is also picturesque.\"\"One of the highlights of the Icefield Parkway.Excellent viewing points of the fallsSufficient parking space.A must do.\"\"The falls are the nicest that I have seen in the Rockies. What is especially nice is that there are several viewing areas and a short walking trail, so it is possible to get some reprieve from all those taking selfies\"Absolutely gorgeous views of the falls. Loved all the levels you can walk to amd enjoy other parts of these beautiful falls.I had very high expectations due to the reviews but still wasn't disappointed. These are small falls but very violent. Loved seeing the power of water/nature. Liked to hike around the area and by hike I mean walk. This is in no way a tough/steep hike.. just easy walk over small bridges/steps. Beautiful views if you go further down.The falls were amazing but very crowed with other tourists. Took some lovely photos as the sun was shining forming rainbows. Suggest visiting in the week.Athabasca Falls is Stunning! Bring your camera. It's an easy walk from the top to the bottom and there are gorgeous views of the river and mountains. Spend an hour or two on your way through Jasper National Park.\"Organized for tourists, close to the road, easy access. Go early: it gets crowded mid day making the visit less enjoyable. Parts of the trail can be a bit tight and awkward. It's probably quite nice late as well, with the sunset lighting up the mountains. It rained intermittently when we were there. Didn't bother us. Always carry rain gear when in western Canada and wear non-slip hiking shoes or boots.\"\"The Athabasca river is VERY high, so this waterfall is POWERFUL. You can hear it and feel it. They have built walkways in the right place, so you can see all the different parts quite well.\"\"Easy walk from the parking lot gets to the falls, great vantage points on both sides of the falls. Make sure you take the hike under the second path under the bridge, It was a nice surprise, basically a walking trail where the water used to run through.\"Took our out of town family to see the falls and they loved it! Weather was great...not too crowded and got lots of great pics!We enjoyed seeing the falls from all angles and took lots of photos. Was perfect to see on our way to Jasper\"Pretty easy walk, great photo opportunity. Go all the way around the walk path to the far end. You get a great view of the falls.\"A circular trail from the parking lot leads to spectacular views of the several falls that comprise this site. Allow one to two hours and bring a camera that can take video. Worth the visit.\"Standing and feeling the spray of the water from the powerful Athabasca Falls, is breathtaking. Where does the water get such energy? The falls are beautiful and awe inspiring. There are steps down to the river which are easy to walk and climb. It is a beautiful part of nature.\"The falls are very conveniently located right beside the highway and are within a very short walk from the free car park. The falls are interesting and the view points offer some great places to take photographs.\"Very beautiful, liked the posts with the information about the falls. Some spots are tight to walk through\"\"We had seen the falls from far away when we were headed rafting. So we were hesitant to stop on the way south from Jasper to LL. But we were traveling using a driving tour ap (Gypsy Guide - highly recommend) and the guy talked so great about it, that we decided to stop.Truly, it was very impressive. And it's great because you can spend as much or as little time here as you want. Just park and walk over or hang out longer.The falls are impressive not due to their height, but the sheer power of so much water being forced down the falls with rocky twists and turns (not a straight line water fall).The only reason for 4 vs 5 stars is I usually rank activities where I spend some time checking places out a 5 and here we went in, took some pics and left. But it's 100% worth the stop.\"\"Impressing waterfall close to the car parking, 10-15 minutes for relax and watch the water stream. In my top 10 list\"\"This is a very nice falls, but it is just down a path from the parking lot, so everybody can see the falls...so everybody does....crowded.Still, it is worth a stop. The falls is wide, the water drops about 40 feet, and there are a couple of side falls which are narrower and higher velocity. The water drops into a narrower channel, so it churns and hisses as it fights its way through the rocks, and finally back to a wider lake.You can cross a bride to the other side, so photo ops abound...worth a look\"We stopped on our way to Jasper from the Columbia Icefields. A very impressive natural sight with good vantage points even though it was very busy.\"We stopped here as it was the number 1 rated activity in the park, but I can only conclude that 99% of people don't want to go more than 30m from their cars to get a view. This is nothing compared to the waterfalls along the Berg Lake trail.\"Fantastic views. Great waterfalls. You can take excellent photographs. Highly recommended. Easily accessible. Plenty of viewing points. Taken many photographs published with this view.Not A far walk not far off the highway worth the time and effort to go and see it it's beautiful . Picnic places and restrooms and lots of hiking and beautiful sceneryThese falls are amazing. The force of the water is powerful and majestic. The gorge is beautiful. Don't miss this if you're in the Canadian Rockies.\"So many vantage points - I took way to many photos from each and every direction possible. It's very popular with bus tours and individuals alike. There are bathroom facilities there and signage about the area and falls. Give yourself at least 30minutes to take it in, only a short walk from the car park.\"\"Great quick stop along the highway. Lots of spots for photographers to take pictures, and a nice path down to the water.\"The water never stops flowing. The rock shapes it creates are wondrous. This is a great place to walk and to look at how water affects geology.\"Went to see the falls. Nice and good place for taking memory pictures of the falls. Easy to reach. The only bad thing there is the washrooms, disgusting and very bad smell.\"Powerful waterway. Very good viewpoints for many photos from many angles. Nice stop along the Icefields Parkway.We saw Moose here! It does get crowded with buses as it is a popular place. That is to be expected with most sites in the area. Plan your visit accordingly.Beautiful view. Athabasca falls is a wonderful spot to stop and take a breath. Lovely spot to relax and connect to the outdoors.\"Go, it will take your breath away, and you just may experience oneness with the universe. Be prepared!\"We stopped and spent quite a bit of time here on our way from Banff to Jasper. Just beautiful to take it all in. Highly recommend.We stopped by the falls on our way between Jasper and Banff and enjoyed the stop. The river is fed by the Athabasca glacier which is an extension from the Columbia Ice Field... the power of the river is great to see... definitely worth the stop.This was a quick stop with much beauty. The guide helped us with some history and made sure we saw the falls from several angles\"It was quite crowded and it was raining when I visited so it was hard to find a good view of the fall (if there is one). But even just at a glimpse, it was really cool seeing how powerful this waterfall is and it was quite fascinating.\"\"We stopped by Athabasca Falls and hiked down to Bridge 4, and then drove to Bridge 6. As other reviewers noted, the most interesting slot and rock formations are in the first several bridges. It is always amazing/pretty to see what nature's force can do with water and rock, and that is very true at Athabasca Falls. This was very similar to Marble Canyon, which we also enjoyed. There were alot of people at Athabasca Falls, but not too many that we couldn't enjoy the views.\"\"Being around the falls area is an experience of the power and wonder of nature. The roar of the the rushing water, cutting it's way through rock faces, creating whirl pool pots is amazing and dynamic. Nice hiking paths in and around falls.area.Well worth the stop. Very close to the highway!\"\"We visited Athabasca Falls early in the morning, before the crowds ascended on it. It was a very nice walk, with interesting signage telling about the falls\"You get to see a lot more majestic vistas if you are willing to walk along a few hiking trails in the area. The waterfall is fine. Worth stopping for 5 min if you happen to cross the general area.\"very nice but go early in the morning , make sure your camera is charged and take the walk around the falls\"\"thoroughly enjoyed the views of the falls, quite busy so have to be patient to get the good shots. Actually returned the following day at a different time. Also walked around to another part of the falls which was a nice quiet walk.\"\"Beautiful Area to visit and falls are easy to get to, just a short 5-10 minute walk. The tip I have for everyone is to arrive early before the crowds get there. You can see Athabasca Falls and surrounding area in one hour.\"Got here at 0800 on a beautiful sunny morning and shared the magical place with one other couple. Spent about an hour walking both sides of the ravine and marvelling at the post glacial power of the river and the wonders it has and continues to create. A real privalage to ba able to spend time here.Great stop along the way. Lots to see and no cost for admission. Walk from top to bottom in 15 minutes or so. Kids thought it was pretty cool too.\"The falls aren't very big, but there are violent. Quite a spectacle and worth stopping for.The trip down to the falls is pretty short, and although it can be uneven and rocky, we managed it with a stroller.\"\"This is right off the road, and requires only easy walking to view. Nice spot, but like anywhere else obey the signs and don't end up in the water. Don't need more than 20 minutes to see it all.\"This must see waterfall is easily accessible and very close to parking lot. You can see it off of highway 93. We stop every year!A good example of what Nature can do... It will surprise anyone with interest on geography and how nature impacts the soil... Not to be missed as the water effect on rocks is to be noticed...\"Must see if only trip to area. Quite busy as just off main highway, coach stop. Allow 1/2 hr-45 min for walk-around. Not strenuous at all. No cafe/restaurant at site. Combine with Mt. Edith Cavell hike further up same road- (more strenuous)\"\"Great spectacle! Plenty of parking. Short easy walk to falls. Plenty of view points on each side from which to take photos from. Spent well over an hour wandering through this site.A must see if in the area!\"\"The falls are not a huge spectacular drop but are very pretty. The water is rushing so fast and has created a channel through the rocks. You can get several views of the falls by following the trail and viewing platforms. You can see the fall from the front, side, and back. There are signs warning not to get off the trail. If you should get out on the rocks and fall, you would most likely not survive because of the speed and cold of the water.This part of the Athabasca is actually considered a Class 6 - nobody has run it. The water is too fast, the openings too narrow.It is an easy walk from the parking lot to the view of the falls. Very nice.\"An astounding place with awesome views. Thoroughly would recommend visiting here. Camera is a necessity to capture the amazing scenery.\"These falls are nice, but Maligne Canyon is considerably more beautiful and natural. This is OK if you've got kids and need a short quick trip.\"Another beautiful stop! Easy walk on well maintained trails. Lots of signs warning you not to go over the fences but we saw people doing it anyway - foolish. Great photo opportunities. We went later in the day and it was still busy.What a wonderful spot to take pictures. You can hike down about yards from parking to the falls. The energy of the water is breath taking. Don't miss itThis was a beautiful stop along the Icefields Parkway. There is a path with various lookouts and signs describing aspects of the falls. The speed and force of the water flowing over the falls was amazing.Athabasca Falls should be a definite stop when visiting Jasper National Park! It is an easy walk to the falls from the parking lot and there are numerous viewpoints from which to see the falls. The power and abundance of water it amazing!\"Lovely, powerful waterfall. A busy tourist destination in the summer but well worth a visit if you can find a parking spot.\"very beautiful canyon. water colors are amazing . take the time to enjoy the view and the river trail.There is a beautiful hiking to see the Athabasca Falls! The water is super blue and clean and super cold too hahah. I touched the water just to feel it and even in the summer it was cold..\"We planned a early morning driving loop from Jasper down Hwy 93 to Hwy 93a first stop Athabasca Falls approx 30 minute easy drive.These falls get very, very crowded (so does all the main sights around Jasper). We beat most of the crowds and enjoy the powerful water flow, falls and the carved out canyon and the stunning scenery.There is excellent paths and signs here that navigate you above the canyon and if you have the time to the end of the canyon.Worth the visit but get in early.\"Plenty of good viewing spots for these powerful falls not far out of jasper. Went there after seeing the glacier that feeds them.I've never been this close to Falls moving at a massive speed as this and with such force. To see the falls in the canyon that it had carved out is quite spectacular. If you're in the area don't miss this.Gorge-ous! Enjoy this stop to see the power of water. Great locations to see the falls and the gorge from a variety of angles.Definitely worth a stop on Hwy 93 for some 'refreshing' views! Was pretty busy when we visited so prepare to share the viewpoints\"Our family enjoyed the falls - good parking, easy access, and description plates that were interesting. The area is beautiful!\"\"This was easy to find, the parking was crowded, but it is popular. Lots of photo opportunities and truly incredible scenery\"Spectacular waterfalls in Jasper. Good parking. You are able to walk around falls to take photographs and walk down area below. Gets really busy so best to go early or later in day. We went at 8:30pm and it was so quiet. The lighting also enhanced the photos we took.\"Athabasca Falls is definitely worth a stop. There are many lookouts to view the raging flow of the Athabasca River carve its way over the rocks. Not only are the falls quite spectacular, so are the rocks that have been sculpted by the force of the water.\"This set of falls will really give you a feel for the power of water. The paths surrounding the falls are quite extensive getting you very close to the water and providing lots of different views. Free to see.A bit busy during the busy season but that's how the whole area is in July.Beautiful iconic spot in the Rockies. Always busy but it's because of the outstanding waterfall. Parking can be tricky when busy.We charged around this attraction after a day on the icefields. We wanted to see where the melt water went.The falls itself is a massive fury of white water that is terrifyingly beautiful. We rushed around it because of a timing issue but it was an awesome sight that warranted more time.The falls are a must see on your trip from Jasper to Banff. Its a short easy walk. It was more spectacular than we expected.\"Very nice, the canyon is a wow, nice boardwalk makes viewing safe and easy, The morning sunlight was difficult for photos, I would recommend visiting later in the day for best effect..\"Stopped here on our way to Jasper. Have been here many times and I am always impressed by Nature. Truly beautiful and breathtaking to see. A short stop will provide you with great pictures and a true appreciation of the great outdoors. Take some time and make this a stop on your way to Jasper or on the way home.\"We stopped here for a stretch. It was a nice walk with awe inspiring views. Beautiful location but a very busy stop too, so expect lots of people!\"We stopped here briefly while driving from Jasper to Moraine Lake. The falls are spectacular and well worth the stop. Hard to describe their power. You could stay longer and do the longer walks but sadly we were pressed for time. Well worth a visit and free of charge.\"The falls get very busy but they are worth going to visit, the path the water has cut into the rock is amazing, like all parks in Canada it is well maintained and easy to access and good parking.\"We visited a number of falls in the Rockies and this was by far the most spectacular and the most interesting. Not difficult to access.\"These Falls were not on our schedule, rather we came across them on our drive from Lake Louise to Jasper. So glad we made a quick detour as they are wonderful to see! There is a delightful trail that guides you around this beautiful natural wonder when you can marvel at the shapes & canyon drops in the rock face. There is a car park nearby and you can spend as much time as you like on the trail. Highly recommended..\"These falls are absolutely magnificent! The immense power coming from the falls is spellbinding. A tru must see!Go to Athabasca Falls...even if you only spend 20 minutes! You will understand the power of Mother Nature and water. It is awe inspiring!What is striking about the Athabasca Falls is really how close you can get to it. It's and easy walk from the parking lot. Half hour to 45 mins is a good time to see the whole of the falls.\"What an amazing view! The power of water is incredible! After walking around the falls and checking out part of the trail, we were amazed. So glad that all the safety measures are in place for people to stay safe around these powerful falls. Rock climbing around water is so dangerous!\"Great views. Very accessible. Multiple view angles on beautiful falls and river. We enjoyed it very much. Close to the I93 but rake the rural road one way - is also niceWe had a quick stop here on our 2 night stay in Jasper. Was very happy that the falls were so close to the parking lot and we didn't have to walk very far. Stunning views and colours of the water.\"wonderful views and worth seeing. But, enjoyed the Maligne Canyon walked a bit better: fewer people and saw more wildlife there as well.\"\"Very nice falls, lot of viewing area, lot of informations, parking could be issue in afternoon. Canyon is nice too.\"\"Another one of the 'must see' natural wonders of the area, so be prepared for tour buses and lots of tourists taking selfies. Take your time so you can go to a less busy part of the area until the tour bus crowd moves on - they usually have a set amount of time so take a bunch of photos then keep moving. Follow the paths down to the river at the bottom and around to the far side of the falls where you'll often see a rainbow form in the spray. It's a beautiful area and you can see how the water has carved different routes through the rock over time. Signs explain how the area has changed over the years and there are plenty of viewpoints for stunning scenery.\"\"Can get very busy, so finding a parking place can be difficult, but well worth it. Falls are spectacular and can get some great photos.\"A very impressive piece of work by nature where a creek cannons through a narrow gap and splashes out. Plenty of spots for great photos.\"We visited many, many waterfalls when we toured the Rockies and I have to say this is one of the best, if not the best. It was certainly the most powerful waterfall we saw by a long shot. It's an excellent short stop on the Icefields Parkway. It won't take long, 30 mins to an hour tops. If you are looking for a more immersive experience, Maligne Canyon provides more variety than Athabasca Falls. You might want to wear a jacket when you visit here as you will likely get sprayed with mist. My camera got a bit wet trying to get some of the more close up photos. That being said, make sure to get there early. We arrived at around 8am and it was nice and quiet, by the time we left at 8:45am or so, the coaches started arriving and we scampered. The same can be said for most attractions on the parkway, you want to be setting off really early!\"Good information on boards as you walk round and plenty of vidwing places. Great photo opportunitiesThe force of these waterfalls was downright gobsmacking. My mouth was on the floor. This is definitely something to see - a waterfall fed by purely glacier water with a seemingly never ending stream of water. There was also a rainbow.. so gorgeous!\"Impressice Waterfall close to Jasper. Lots of people, of course, but also lots of parking. No entrance fee.\"Just off Rte 93 about 20 minutes south of Jasper. Take a 45 minute stop when passing Athabasca Falls. The power and beauty of these falls is worth taking some time out from your travels. I actually drove down from Jasper just to see the falls. Great pictures as the water drops to canyon floor below.\"Beautiful, but we chose to forego the throngs of tour buses and crowds for less crowded sights. Disappointed. Parks have added different advantage points in order to view the falls, which is helpful.\"Love visiting these falls. Go each year as we camp at Wabasso. There are many viewpoints to take pictures from. Fun to go all the way down to see the rafters take off. Amazing to see nature at work\"Just a great place , close to nature. Well worth a stop here. Close to the main road. Nice for picnic stop. Stone beach area beyond the falls fun for kiddies to explore. Lots of info about the Falls for the readers among us. Good half day trip.\"Well worth a visit although the area gets crowded and you need to be patient with the crowds from the coach tours who take photos from every angle. Definitely the most impressive falls in the area.\"Very impressive falls with easy access and plenty of parking, well worth a visit, an easy drive from Jasper. Great photos opportunities.\"\"It is a very powerful experience to see the force of nature. There are several trails to take to get different views of the falls. It is very easy walking, making it accessible to people of all ages.\"\"Lovely place to stop by. It was busy, but the scenery was worth it. Look for the rainbow, as the sun comes through. We enjoyed the beauty. People are crazy,though, and go behind barriers. Don't do that!\"Enjoyed the sites but a bit busy when we were there. Ample parking and toilets available. very prettyVery brief hike to see some amazing falls. It was busy but seemed set up well to handle the people. Easy & quick to check it out if you're driving by.\"Worth a visit just to see the power of a river squeezed through a narrow gap.As our North American friends are prone to saying, \"\"awesome.\"\"There's no admission fee, a free car park ( which can get crowded) and toilets.So there's absolutely no reason not to visit this fabulous natural spectacle.\"\"It is a wonderful waterfall, but unfortunately the park had to build too many concrete walkways and bridges around it to handle all the people\"\"This is so easy to get to that it should be on everyone's itinerary.One of the best falls in either National Parks\"\"This is one of those places for your bucket list. Truly awesome, nature at its most spectacular. A gorge with fast flowing icy water that ends in a turquoise pool, and the noise is amazing. Slippery ice under foot !\"The falls are beautiful and worth a look but there's not much room from which you can get a good view and when we went - a Thursday afternoon in August - it was very busy so I'd suggest this as a brief stop off rather than a day-trip destination.We were lucky enough to stop her on our tour amazing water falls just to stop and listen to water coming down crystal clear amazing .Not breathtaking but beautiful. Super crowded. Fun to walk along the various trails. Good parking. Filthy dirty nasty bathrooms. Easily accessible by RV. Quite popular stop.\"Don't miss these falls. The sheer volume of water in the summer makes this what the word \"\"awesome\"\" was invented for. Easy walk even for the less mobile. Very accessible and safe for kids to see (safely fenced off\"\". 30mins and you are done. But worth the detour.\"\"As a traveller.who have been to Niagara fall many times, I did not expect another fall could draw my attention. However Athabasca fall definitely worth your time. The view is spectacular and you can actually see the fall from multiple angles which is a huge plus. Highly recommended.\"\"I saw that this was the #1 rated thing to do in the park, but we went to Maligne Canyon the day before and I couldn't imagine how anything could be better than that. But this was! A man was there with a wooden flute and played some music for us. Such a delightful time! The walking is not too strenuous, either.\"\"We were so close to the raging two-pronged Athabasca Falls that the sound was thunderous. All along the walkways, we saw and felt the force of the water as it plunged and squeezed into a narrowing cavernous pit and then into a lake that soon became rapids. Niagara Falls may not have another rival in Canada, but Athabasca Falls could be its awesome little sister.\"\"Athabasca Falls was my favorite falls in Banff or Jasper 40 years ago and still is. Don't miss it for sure!If you like falls, don't miss Marble Canyon just on the other side of the Continental Divide in Kootenay Natl Park.\"\"Not a long walk, but lots of information along the way. Wonderful views of the canyons and falls. Make sure to go early or late, it does get crowded with bus loads of tourists.\"Beautiful place to visit. Absolutely stunning views and a nice walk around the site. Lots of parking as well.Biggest falls seen in the area. Plan to arrive before 10 am before parking lot is full or after 4 pm when cars leave. Keep camera close to avoid water spray.\"Like always, God's creation is amazing. Self guided tour allows you to do what you want. It can be easy or hard if you want.\"We stopped here while heading to the columbia ice fields - nice little stop in the day! the falls are great and the foot paths are well maintained.\"These stunning falls are right next to the road so of course they're crowded with people most of the time during the summer. Worth the trip, yes, though I would encourage those who can to venture a bit farther than just the area around the car park.\"\"Very touristic place, there are other falls to visit. The Athabasca Falls are worth a visit though, they're beautiful and large.\"The water is very clear and the scenery is simply stunning. Go early in the morning to avoid the big tour buses.Mixture of power and beauty. This is a must visit to see crashing waves and stunning beach front at the bottom. Really good to match it with Mount Edith Cavell.\"Nice visit, just around the corner from the road. When you are in the parc, do not miss it! You will be rewarded with spectacular views.\"So glad we stopped here. The falls were amazing. There were bridges and walking paths all around the area and a walkway down to the bottom. Down below was s perfect place to take your shoes off and wade in the river. I paid to go on the Skywalk and this was free and so much betterThis place gets crowded but it is a must stop along the road. Easy paved walk to roaring waterfalls.Only just off the main route through Jasper National Park. Good views of the falls and interesting information boards at points along the gorge. We went across to the rapids on the other side of the road and were entertained watching people set of for the white water rafting. Well worth a visit but try and get there early in the day.Beautiful stop! Spectacular scenery! It was so beautiful and breathtaking. The walking paths to the falls were very convenient and safe. Don't miss this stop!\"Athabasca Falls is not a quick stop. Plan on at least 30 minutes to wander the trails and take pictures from various locations. It is a lovely stop, and much less crowded than further South around Lake Louise. Stay on the path and behind the fence. Memorials to those who did not can be found near the falls.\"\"The falls is beautiful and and an easy walk for both young and old. Excellent paved & wooden trails allow you to walk all around the falls and see it at many angles. We went when it was lightly raining which did not distract from the beauty. The falls at the top is powerful and you'll get covered with the spray, it continues on down the mountain with tunnels of swirling water. If you go at high season get there early or late to really soak it in. A 'must see' in the Rockies!\"\"Magnificent scenery and well worth the stop off the Columbia Icefields Parkway. They are not huge falls, but they are beautiful. We were advised to go either early or late in the day to avoid the masses of people and we did go prior to 11am, so the crowds weren't too bad yet. The parking was not yet full at this time.\"\"Easy walk, paved, with great views of the falls. The water thunders, creating lots of spray. It is certainly worth the stop off the ice fields parkway.\"\"Several people recommended that we not miss the Falls. They were right and we were not disappointed. They are powerful and easily accessible. As you walk along the trail, there are many great vantage points. Feeling the spray and hearing the roar of the water are breathtaking. Don't miss it!!!!\"\"I feel churlish giving this awesome sight a rating of 4 instead of 5, but the simple truth is that the enormous number of visitors significantly detracted from the experience. We got there about noon and could barely find a parking space. Moving along the paved trail feeling rather like part of a cattle herd, we often had to wait for a spot at the railing from which to survey and photograph the cascading falls surrounded by lush green trees and blue mountains. Yes, it was all worth it, as you will see if you click on the pictures I've attached. But a word to the wise: get here early or late for a more intimate experience. Even better, try to plan your visit somewhat outside (before or after) the busy summer season. We didn't have that flexibility so just made the best of it. You can too, and still bring back very pleasant if not ideal memories of this beautiful waterfall in its impressive setting.If your timing isn't flexible and you hate crowds, you might consider skipping the falls and heading instead to the nearby Leech (sometimes spelled Leach) Lake picnic area. You won't find rushing water, but you will find still water with simply amazing reflections. I've attached one of the numerous pictures I snapped there, where we were the only visitors and so enjoyed the kind of solitude most conducive to contemplation of nature's wonders. This lovely picnic area would also make a wonderful spot to stop before or after your visit to the noisy, crowded falls. So you might build a picnic lunch or a snack there into your schedule. There's a dock for swimming or boating too. We just stumbled over this magical place on the way to the falls, so wanted to be sure to let you know it is \"\"out there\"\" if you'd like to take advantage of it while visiting Athabasca Falls. It's located on 93A just before it rejoins 93 right by the falls.\"This is a must not miss waterfall even if you've seen hundreds of falls. The power of the water is unbelieveable. It is a sight and sound place. Walking to the falls was well maintained and felt safe.Nice easy walk along the side of the falls. Quite spectacula and very scenic. Car parking next to the falls.The incredible power of the water! It was a rainy day when we went but this didn't spoil the amazing scene.We have been there in the rain and it was worth it. It's impressive how the water seeks it's way down through the rocks.\"Pull over and be prepared to have your breath taken away. A force of nature meets a stubborn landmass and wins, but you can walk back in time along one of its previous attempts to overcome.Genuinely awesome!Please be careful, both above and below the falls. Death has many smooth-talking dealers around here from coy but slippery rocks above to proud yet weakened outcrops below. All of which entice you with the pleasure of being their first human to try and yet have lured many a stranger into their riverbed!Sweet dreams are made of this by mere mortals such as we\"Don't miss stopping at these falls if you are driving through the the ice fields. Phenomenal amount of water coming down the falls. Don't miss all of the different observation areas. They all have different views of the various parts of the falls. Need to spend at least 30 minutes there.\"It is amazingly wonder, the waterfalls, the trees and the rocks even the moss are always wonderfully combined together. You see all different astonishing views while walking along the trail.\"\"If you love the sound of roaring water and the power of water, this is a stop you must make. The paths to the falls are paved and easily traversing. I could truly appreciate the power of water in this place. It's a great stop along the Iceland Highway!\"The easy access to this waterfall meant hoards of people taking selfie upon selfie. I would give this waterfall an excellent rating if it took even a little bit of effort to get to but it is literally right next to the parking lot. Still very beautiful.\"These falls are quite lovely and, happily, just a short walk away from the car park. Very easily accessible and if you follow the path you can get very, very close to the bottom area of the falls.\"We visited the Athabascar Falls on the way to the Columbia Icefields. Not massive but extremely powerful they are worth the trip. Some great photo opportunities.A little walk off the beaten trail but the falls are well worth it. Hard to believe the whole thing freezes solid in the winter.\"We stopped here without expectations this late in the season, but the falls were flowing great and we gpt some great shots, very easy to get too.\"Called in at the falls on the way to Jasper and we only wish we could have spent longer than half an hour exploring the different views. The different viewing platforms ensure that you have great views of the falls from every angle. Short but great stop. Well recommended.Lovely stop on the Icefields Parkway. Short walk to various view points of the falls. Definitely worth going down to the bottom of the canyon and river viewing areas.\"Go early, really nice to see the calls from different angles but also the rochformations from earlier river pathsGeocache is present also\"\"Visited the Athabasca Falls as part of a Rockies tour, the falls and the walk to it are breath taking and worth the walk.\"\"This is about 30 minutes south of Jasper - so a great stop on the way to and from Jasper, or even as a short road trip from Jasper. - easily accessible pathways along the waterfalls- steep stairs down to river but worth it- busy with campers and buses- large parking and picnic area Enjoy the beauty of the Rockies!\"\"Very cool to see where the falls originally started. Beautiful scenery. Nice paved pathways, easy walking.\"This is a small but amazing wonderful canyon. ok it is not the Grand Canyon but it is beautiful in its own right. You get lovely views and you can take a stroll for almost 1.5 hrs (one way) with the river. Definitely worth the trip.\"After seeing the Athabasca Icewalks, this water fall kind of pales unfortunately as it didn't hold the same grand urge. I suggest seeing before you walk the ice\"\"This is the must visit if you are going to Jasper. The serenity of water fall sound and the beautiful Canyon. Few meters walk and you are right at the fall. Jasper and Banff is been blessed by nature. Abundant falls, lakes and canyons. This is one of the largest fall you visit without a hike.\"Along beautiful Icefields Parkway. Good stop easy to see. Hiking id you want or just go to three bridges for great views of the falls.\"The roar of the water was amazing. There's a small trail that will take you down to the river, but first you cross through the channel that the river used to run through! The rocks in the channel are great for photos! All of the walks are paved so it's great for all ages!!\"A short walk will allow you to see these beautiful falls. It was raining when we were here so we were not able to take in the full beauty but still a worthwhile stop.\"So glad we followed our tour book and stopped here! Lovely waterfalls and easy canyon walk not far from Jasper. Places to sit for a picnic, clean outhouse facilities. Enjoyed by many family groups.\"The falls are easy to get to without a lot of walking so they are very accessible to everyone and are absolutely beautiful.\"Pretty falls, you can drive up to there. So, not much walking from the car. Then you can go down the stairs to the river. Nice. I would recommend it :)\"A great experience. The sheer power of the falls and how close you are make this special. The safety touches are very cool.Amazing canyon and waterfalls. Such an interesting place it was bound to be busy and it was! As with all natural attractions in Canada it is well presented and spotlessly clean. Some quite pushy tourists about so keep your elbows handy and watch your step if the paths are wet!\"Not to be missed. You can often see a rainbow in the spray from the falls. Best access is from the Icefields Parkway road, as the 93a from Jasper to Athabasca Falls is in a very poor condition.\"\"If you get a chance to stop for a visit, do it! The setting is stunning, as are the beautiful trails alongside the river / gorge.\"I stopped at the Athabasca Falls to look around and take some pictures. It is spectacular and well worth taking the time to stop.Ok... Don't spend all of your vacation for this. But it's a good 45 minutes to see somethings good. I like fishing and the story about the bull trout there is very interesting\"We stoped here as part the Icefields Parkway Drive from Jasper to Bannf. A relatively short walk, very easy, but a must see place! The falls are beatiful and very powerful. DON'T MISS IT!\"\"It might not be the highest in Canada, but it sure is worth stopping even in the rain. Only 10 minutes from the parking lot on pavement, but it is a little steep a climb.\"I've been coming to Jasper for years and I always love stopping at the Athabasca Falls. It's absolutely worth the extra drive out of Jasper. It's beautiful!\"This would have got 4 stars but in July it's way too busy. I have visited this fall in all seasons and it's worth a quick stop and toilet break. It's free, and outside of summer, it's a relaxing little walk and a good selfie photo backdrop.\"\"These are a condensed version of higher and larger falls. Here you can really get an idea of the way canyons are formed. The layers of rocks cut through by the sheer force of the water, potholes bored into the curves of the lower end.This is Hydro Power in its untamed glory.\"Stop over for an hour or so while on the highway. Short walks to all views of the falls. Can be visited from jasper townsite also.Stunning views and the sound of the water is amazing! Walk down the old spill way to see where the falls runs off. Hard to get down to the lake with a young child but the view at the bottom of the spill way is enough.\"Not as good as other waterfalls in Banff/ Jasper but within 200m reach of the car park. We spent time walking around the old falls also so it took 40- 60 minutes.Free and easy to access for all\"\"We visited with friends who live in Canada, despite setting the falls many times they keep coming back and we can see why.Good parking and a great rest break on the journey from Banff to jasper this is an amazing view and the view points they have built are not intrusiveWould suggest you visit on a sunny day as the spray from the falls becomes iridescent.Pete\"\"Stopped here for 30 minutes on our tour what a spectacular place, one of many things we have seen in this area\"When you go to Jasper the Athabasca Falls are a must. Wear comfortable shoes for the small hike. But the falls are worth seeing.\"We LOVE waterfalls. This was right near our hostel so not only did we enjoy the falls, we journeyed a bit up the path to the river leading to the falls. Here we napped on the rocks in the sunshine surrounded by mountains & NO TOURISTS. Give it a go. Enjoy the falls, be mindful of the memorial for the fella who lost his life, and spend some time on the river, relaxing before the next stop on the way.\"\"This was our second time to the falls. The falls are loud and beautiful. On the downside, expect heavy crowds. Things have changed a bit since our last trip. There are now signs posted throughtout telling people not to be \"\"stupid\"\". Its not the parks fault but on stupid visitors.\"\"Like many of the short hikes we did in Jasper, the Athabasca Falls trails gave us a wonderful variety of views. We saw the falls in July and the amount of water was awe inspiring. We also saw it in pretty steady rain and would still recommend stopping.\"Enjoyed the falls . Great picture opportunities. Worth stopping along Icefields Pkway for this one. Enjoy!The waterfalls is within easy reach from the car park. It is on the way between the Columbia Icefield and Jasper - about 30km to Jasper. The roar of the waterfalls is simply majestic. Not to be missed.It's a nice waterfall with viewpoints on both sides and some paths through the old channels. The views downstream are nice as well.Along the Icefield Parkway another amazing stop and see. Would suggest stop along way as we went past it and drove from Hinton back an hour plus ride back. Simply amazing view and placeThese falls are so beautiful and different from others in the area in that they have created cylindrical craved areas in the rock formations. They are quite stunning and worth the time. Easy walking paths. Some stairs but manageable for most ability levels. Some parts not wheel chair accessible.Scenic falls and interesting rock formations. Follow the walkway to get different views and make this one of your stops on the Icefields Parkway\"Easy hike. Beautiful scenery,even on a rainy day. Well worth the trek. You can easily spend half a day here.\"What a lovely sight as you r driving down the highway. These falls are so close to the road and so good to look at.\"Powerful falls, so hold onto your kids. Beautiful viewpoints, though. Take the time to stop and walk around this area to see the falls.\"The walk along the river lets you see the full power of the river and there are helpful signs explaining the geology of the river and how it has shaped the landscape. The sight is busier than Sunwapta Falls just along the road and the photo opportunities are lessWorth a car drive to see torrenting waterfalls and river canyon. Need Park pass to enter area but lots of stunning scenery wherever you look. Avoid when buses turn up!!!\"Very busy site on the way to the Columbia Ice Fields. Does require some walking to get to, but well worth the walk. It is hard to grasp the scope of the falls and the speed of the water rushing through. Very pictureseque!\"\"This was beyond beautiful. Everyone needs to stop there. You won't ever forget nature at its best. We had read about it, but words just tell it all. Hope everyone gets to see these Falls.\"A well laid out public access. Well maintained. Good paths to get pictures and views of the falls. Interesting natural formations.i was there with family. we walked around the falls and got some nice pictures. a few too many people there but not bad and everyone spreads out quickly. worth stopping in.Great viewing sites on carefully constructed concrete bridges span these picturesque falls with plenty of space for all to see - along with helpful descriptive plaques\"We have past the route from Columbia Ice Fields to Jasper twice before and had not stopped to visit Athabasca Falls. This time was different, so happy we did. Equal parts natural wonder and education makes this a worthwhile 30-60 minute stop.\"\"A must visit attraction. Powerful waterfalls, easy access, another symbol af the Candian RockiesGraet for people from all ages including kids\"If you are driving from Lake Louise to Jasper watch out for the police trap waiting you after the Ice Fields. The speed changes from 90 to 50 and you are going downhill. There are 4-5 police pulling people over. I thought it was an accident so many cars were on the side of the road. Way to welcome visitors CANADA.\"These falls are huge. They're easily accessible from the highway and there's nothing strenuous about the walk around them, they're definitely worth a stop for photos. On a hot day its great to feel the spray coming from them and some good picture opportunities. Just be sure to stay behind the safety barricade, they're immensely powerful!\"These falls are awesome. The volume of water flowing over and down the falls is amazing and well worth going to seeThe glowing reviews on trip advisor lured us to stop at this place as we were on our way to Jasper from Banff. It was one of those rare moments when the place exceeded the hype surrounding it.Definitely bring your camera. You can walk around the falls. I would suggest bring your camera you can even do a little video taping with your phone. It does get crowded at times and is a popular spot for bus tours to stop. But overall it is worth stopping.The Athabasca Falls are one of many must see attractions if you are in the Jasper National Park. The are a few viewing bridges where you can stand and watch the falls thundering down as well as a well deserved selfie or family photograph. it is nature at its best. There are well marked trails telling you where to stand and where it is dangerous to venture. Highly recommended.\"Located in Jasper National Park (30 kilometers south of Jasper town), this is a powerful and picturesque waterfall. The falls can be safely viewed and photographed from various viewing platforms and walking trails around the falls. For those nature-lovers, this is a mandatory stop! Enjoy the fresh air and the sound of water falling into the gorge :-)\"Very beautiful. Definitely worth the stop. This is one of the main attractions on this route. Not very handicap accessible.\"We were heading back to Jasper after visiting the Ice Explorer, these falls are defiantly worth a stop at, the views are amazing!\"This is a must see on your way to/from Jasper.

It was very busy, but the set up allows for a clean flow of vehicles and people. Overall a must see for anyone. Would definitely go back.\"\"The trails to the fall are easy to take. Some steps are narrow and steeply, but overall is ok for everyone.The fall itself is not so big, but water stream is very strong.\"A beautiful place to visit. Somewhat crowded when the busses are there. Worth every step of the way of your self guided tour\"Amazing display of the power of water. Due to easy accessibility, can be crowded with tour buses. Probably best to go early or later in day.\"We as a tour group stopped here. It is a short walk to the falls and definitely worth it. The view of the falls is spectacular! The water rushing through the cut rocks is beautiful.This is a nice hidden place. Worth to make a visit as it is not too far from the Fairmont Jasper Lodge.These are really impressive falls with numerous great viewing points from different positions. There is a high flow through them which is mesmerising. A must stop to see. They're pretty busy but there's quite a lot of parking available.Absolutely wonderful trip. Canada has a lot to offer with such beautiful scenery. I highly recommend seeing Athabasca Falls. We enjoyed it as a part of a bus tour.\"Athabasca Falls is a must see, but would recommend going early or later in the day due to the number of people there. We walked out along the river away from the falls and found a nice quite beach to relax.\"If you want to experience a roaring waterfall and the mist spraying your face this is the place! It's a simple walk on a cement path and beautiful views of the falls. There are educational placards along the way too. The backdrop is gorgeous!Easy enough hike and just off the road. It is a great stop and amazing to see natural and it's forces. Get out and go see it!Well worth stopping of to see these thunderous falls . Gets quite busy with lots of coach parties so be prepared to have to wait for photographs as the obligatory selfies by the Chinese but fun watching them !!!Easilly accessible. Great waterfalls and canyon. I especially liked the steps down the small canyon that had once been the route for the river that ran under the main road bridge. Note when exiting the car park - don't believe the sign that says that the 93A route is not surfaced - it is - all the way to Jasper.Take Hwy 93 and not 93A to Athabasca Falls...it will be much faster. Parking was convenient and the trails around the falls was nice and easy.\"My husband and I did a day trip from Jasper to The Athabasca Falls, Sunwapta falls and viewpoints in between. Athabasca Falls were impressive and the scenery was lovely even on a grey day.\"Beautiful falls with nice walking path through a canyon. Amazed at the power of the water cutting through the rocks.

Not overly busy when we attended, which was nice.\"Lot of water running down this falls. Very nice even though it is no Niagara Falls. Check out the lower part of the falls Good place for a picnic\"These falls are impressive both in the power of the water, turbulence in the basins, and beauty of the rocks alongside. The canyon is very deep and tortuous. The access path is easy and crosses over in two vantage points for photos. Alittle slippery so be careful.\"Nicely done viewing area! Lower canyon has nice views on the river! Liked it better than Sunwapta falls. Esp nice just before sunsetDefinitely a place to stop off at on your trip from Banfff to Jasper. Extremely popular so if you can go early or late you won't have to jostle for the best photo spots.\"The best part of these falls is that they are accessible to all and that there are many viewpoints. We saw a rainbow right over the falls that seemed magical. Just get there early bc parking fills up quickly and like all these natural beauties, the less people around the more beautiful it seems.\"A beautiful way to see the Canadian Rockies nature taking its course!

There is a stunning backdrop to these falls. Please take the time to stop and visit.\"Incredible torrent of water pounding over the rocks with enormous force. You get a new appreciation of the power of water. (At least two benches on the banks with plaques dedicated to young men who decided to get off the excellent boardwalk viewing areas to get close to the water, and paid for it with their lives.) Easily accessible from the park highway, and well worth a stop.\"My favourite place I visited In Jasper and Banff National Parks. The colour of the water is so beautiful and its so majestic and powerful. It looked like there were loads of beautiful trails around too. You can look at it from different viewpoints and you can walk down to the river on the otherside that it leads too as well. Definately will come back again.It is fascinating to see the way the rock flour and silt from the Athabasca River has carved out the rocks. It's breath-taking and worth-while the stop as you travel down the Iceland's HighwayBeautiful views and narrow walkways with the water cascading through the gorge at all angles. It really is a must if you are in the area.\"If you like waterfalls, don't miss this one! Impressive! The rocks colors and the power of the water combine to make for a worthy roadside stop along icefields parkway.\"This is a must visit if you are in the area. The power of the water is truly amazing. Great display boards giving information about the falls and the area. Get there early if you can before the coach parties arrive. Lovely walks in area to view the falls from different places.the falls were beautiful and i got lots of great pictures. it is easy to get to and great for everyone. the only down side like with many activities in canada is that the parking situation is not greatMy husband proposed to me here 12 years ago and this is the first time we have been back since - with our four kids in tow! It is beautiful and I could stay there for hours listening to the water and checking out the gorgeous mountains. We walked down through the rock formations to the river the falls flow into. It is just nature at its finest.Always awe-inspiring to see the power of nature! You can spend as much or as little time as you want there.\"A spectacular waterfalls and beautiful rock canyon. Easy access by car, close walking distance to the falls.Just a few miles outside of Jasper.Mountain views around the waterfalls.Large parking lot.\"\"There are plenty of amazing sites to visit in the Rockies, especially throughout Jasper.Athabasca Falls is great if you are travelling in large groups, with children or you generally need easy access. Get there early before the tour buses. At 8am you will have the carpark to yourself, after 10..good luck finding a place...to park or stand.However I was a little disappointed as I thought Id see a more vertical fall. White Water Rafting on the other side of the falls was fun, and a good class II rapid.\"\"Stand next to Mother Nature’s fury and experience the full force of Athabaska Falls. The rushing water exudes an overwhelming sense of power both visually as well as in the cool mist and near deafening roar. The recreation area also has some paved walkways that wind through cavernous conduits over the runoff from the falls, leading to a platform overlooking where the canyon flushes out into a wide river again. We stopped at Athabasca Falls on a whim during a road trip through the Icefields Parkway. This is well worth the pull over and a spectacular sight. We were there during the busiest part of the season – mid-august – and consequently a hoard of tourists had also flooded the lookout decks. Seems like everyone wanted to take excessive selfies and photos next to the falls, which really created an annoying bottleneck of self-absorbed tourists flashing absurd poses behind cameras. Tried not to let that ruin the experience. My girlfriend returned in early April this year and said it was less inspiring because the spring runoff had not yet begun. The falls were half frozen and hadn’t reached the full potential of water flow, so my suggestion would be to go later in the summer for the full effect. Pros:-Spectacular natural showcase of a river waterfall-Easily located in a pull-off on the north section of the Icefields ParkwayCons:-Tourists. Tourists everywhere.\"\"not a hiking trip, but an accessible little waterfall with the Rockies around. ON the way from Jasper to Banff/Lake Louise, close to Jasper. So one could easily do a quick trip from Jasper to see it.\"\"Nice set of waterfalls, easy walk. Impressive falls, but not quite as nice as Sunwapta. There are several viewing platforms, some that let you get quite close and feel the mist of the falls. There are a couple flats trails around the falls area if you want to spend more time here, but personally I'd make it more of a quick stop. It was a very nice stop along the icefields parkway, but I wouldn't plan on spending more than 30-45 minutes. I'm not sure why it is ranked #1 of things to do in Jasper. Spend a little less time here, and more time the Horseshoe lake which is a couple minutes away.\"Great canyon rock formations and powerful fall! On highway 93 so that you can just stop by for 15 to 30 minutes on the way to Jasper or Lake Louise.\"These falls are amazing, lots of water and very loud. Easy to park and not much of a walk to reach the falls. There are plenty of vantage points for photos, each viewing spot was just as impressive as each other. Well worth visiting\"\"Athabasca Falls is a must stop, easy on/off from Icefields Parkway and only about 3040 minutes south of Jasper. Worth a 30-60 minute stop regardless of the weather. great viewing from both sides of the Falls\"This is a popular and crowded stop but it's worth doing. We lucked out and got a break from the rain while there. Very impressive to see and hear the power of the water going through the canyon.We stopped here on our way to Jasper from Banff. Very nice falls and views! Another great spot to take a break along the Icefields Parkway!\"Stunning location easy to get to from car park although if you want to walk further lots of steps up and down.The waterfall is beautiful and the sort of place photographers will love.Quiet busy so early morning or evening would be good\"\"Our experience of these falls was quick and impressive. A quick pull off of the highway and a very short walk to the falls. There are many different vantage points, with good signage and information. The path continues through an old canyon carved by the falls many many years ago and opens to the calm river downstream.This is well worth the stop!\"On our trips to the Rockies we have passed this. On this trip we stopped and I'm so glad we did! WOW! The walking path is perfect to enjoy the noise and grandeur of the river as it drops thru canyons along the way. There are many scenic places along the way. Most of it is accessible by all. Definitely a place to see!This is a very easy walk appropriate for almost anyone. I did see a couple of people with crutches and a wheelchair. Not quite sure they could manage the back side which is where the best view is.Glorious waterfall with a incredible feel. the sound of the rushing water and the carved eroded rocks are amazing.Spectacular sights and sounds . So glad we stopped . Busy but plenty vantage points . Easy access off highway and easy parking . Well worth a look\"Alot of people here, but we still enjoyed the falls. You can view at different levels and also walk to the canyon/river part of the area. Worth the stop.\"\"Worth half an hour to visit these falls off Highway 93.Easy access from the parking lot and not a long walk. Options to go to the lower falls which takes more effort, and probably not worth it!\"\"Always a favourite. You can hear the falls before you see them. there are many vantage points where you can view the falls from different angles. On a good day in the canyon to the left of the falls you can see a very distinct rainbow, worth the wait when it is crowded. The walk down the canyon gives an indication of the changes in the terrain showing the layers of rock laid down through the ages.\"\"The falls are easily accessed from the car park so, this is a popular stop for the tour buses. It is lovely here and the river and falls cut a nice gorge into the slow moving flat part of the river.I was more impressed with Maligne Canyon but this is quite beautiful as well.\"always a magnificent view worth the walk from the parking lot. a shame they cannot make a larger viewing area with all of the people that come to see it. closer parking for elderly and handicapped would be very nice. why should only tour buses park closer.You arrive and first see the falls from the top. You then move down from the falls and have the option to see the falls from the other side. This waterfall is very narrow with nice rock formations on both sides. Very powerful and just hope it's not raining when you visit.\"Yes, this is one of the places tourists flock to, but since we'd hiked and driven all over Jasper and managed to avoid swarms of tourists, we didn't mind too much seeing these awesome falls. Of course, it would be nice if people had a clue and didn't monopolize all the views while they took 95 pictures and selfies, but that's tourists for you. Definitely a nice stop to get out and admire the canyon and falls and then be on your way.\"We went early in the morning (about 8AM) to try and avoid the crowds we had heard about. It totally worked as there wasn't even a tour bus in the parking lot. It's a short walk from the parking lot and there are many viewing areas where you can get some great pictures or just stand and feel the power of nature as it roars past you.\"This falls was powerful and swift, a short walk from parking lot. You must stop here and see this awesome force of nature!\"There is a large free parking area. It is a short walk top the falls. There are good viewing areas. Well worth the stop & walk - took many photos !\"Another beautiful place in the Canadian rockies. These falls are a short and easy walk away. Very beautiful especially with the mountain peak in the background.You can also see rainbows at various angles!\"Stop for half an hour and enjoy these beautiful falls. It is a short and not taxing walk with great viewing platforms to observe from.Stop off point on the way from Lake Louise to Jasper. Well worth stopping off here. It's an easy trail that unwinds to reveal stunning views and a truly beautiful waterfall.\"Definitely a highlight along the Icefields Parkway that warrants a stop. But, being so accessible from the road, prepare for crowds especially at peak hours. I think a lot of people make the drive a day trip from Banff and arrive at the Falls early to mid afternoon and then head back.\"This is one amazing falls very much so worth the stop lot of different place to see it from and take pictures the noise from the fall is very loudWe called in during our tour and were amazed at the size of the areas and angles available to photograph this natural phenomenon.\"Well woth visiting, but gets seasonally busy with coach loads of visitors making photographs difficult without patience.\"A great stop on the Icefield Parkway. fantastic falls.Ignore the crowds and walk a little fiurther towards the lakeA must-see! We went later in the afternoon when the crowds were minimal. The power of the water is amazing and worth the visit.\"Athabasca falls are impressive and definitely worth a visit. Try and time your visit early in the morning or later in the afternoon when the crowds are less. We attended during peak times and did laps of the car park trying to find somewhere to park, but after we found one and viewed the falls , we understood why it was so popular.\"The falls are beautiful and worth the stop on the highway. We spent about 30 minutes enjoying a few of the viewpoints. The power of water is in full display at this site.\"Nature at its best.Clean safe concrete walk ways, good railings for safety, and many viewpoints to take amazing pictures.Lots of free parking, several clean washrooms.\"While travelling along Highway 93 it's worth making a stop to visit the falls. Just watching and listening to the rush of water is both exhilarating and peaceful.\"a place to stop and rest the legs and have a great picnic.The pictures and and the views are worth the stop.\"The Falls and the canyon were beautiful. There are several walkways that give differing views of the falls and the effect of the water on the surrounding rocks. One of the walks is down an old channel of the falls and you can see where the water cut the rocks.\"I'm torn on what to write. I'm giving it a \"\"very good\"\" rating because I loved it when I was a kid, but it didn't have the same impact on me the second time I went as an adult. It's a good way to kill 30-60 minutes. The views are stunning and you'll have the opportunity to take a lot of nice pictures, but it isn't a situation I love. It feels like a Banff attraction that is in Jasper. It was packed with tourists the two times I went. That kind of takes away from the experience for me. You want to take a moment to soak in the view, but you also don't want to be rude to the people waiting to stand in that prime spot. There are a few areas where it can get pretty congested. I'd also recommend bringing a light jacket. You might not need it but there's a fairly constant breeze that can make it a little cold. There are other places around Jasper that I would recommend over the Athabasca Falls, but there is something special about seeing that powerful water flowing.\"\"Easily accessible waterfall with high volume. Below, there are whirlpools carved into bedrock before spilling out into a lake about 3 blocks below falls. Well worth the stop needed to see them, as they are so readily accessible.\"Easy access to impressive falls. Beautiful mountain in the background. Climb down to the bottom through the staircase made out of the rock. Beautiful area. Only con is it is filled with people and many are rude. Lots of tour bus visitors that swarm.Plan at least 30 minutes to walk around and photograph the falls and river. This is probably the nicest stop along the highway between Banff and Jasper.\"We went to the falls at noon. A very nice place to go.The waterfalls are lovely and also the views nearby.A site you must if it's on the way.\"The snow was melting and feeding this incredible waterfall. The volume of water and the constant roar was amazing.A hiking path winds along the river and falls. You can go as far as or as short as you want. Great viewsHuge waterfall with almost no hiking or climbing required. Numerous viewpoints. Can also climb down to the bottom of the falls where the join the river.Great views of the waterfalls and rivers. We liked walking around the short trails to see different views of the falls and river. Only thing we didn't love was that there were a lot of tourists. As we walked farther away from the falls there...More\"Travelled in June 2016We were staying at jasper and drove to the falls about 45 minutes away.They were stunning not the biggest falls I have seen but well worth a visit and it's freeEnough said\"Beautiful falls with mountain backdrops. There is lots of free parking and paved trails to walk. They have washrooms in the parking lot.\"Not faraway from Jasper. It was really impressive to see such a beautiful fall! With the change of the sun, the view was changing as well.\"\"The falls are not very high, but they are very cool and powerful.Go early in the morning if you want to avoid crowd!\"We would recommend getting a rafting tour down the river. Great for families with children 6 plus. Not scary at all\"We visited these falls as part of our day tour/transfer from Jasper to Lake Louise. It was booked through Brewster Tours, who provided an excellent driver/knowledgeable guide to the area and an attentive on board tour manager. Brewster were reliable, picked us up hotel to...More\"This place is not to be missed! A very beautiful place for picture taking. So close to nature. Just wonderful. Quite a number of tour buses parked when we came so sort of crowded. Its June and lots of water flowing and was just amazing.\"We were on our way from Banff to Jasper and this was on the way. Great stop, worth it for the falls, there are various lookouts and plenty of info boards.\"Beautiful waterfalls that provide plenty of photographic opportunities at different angles - so bring your camera and make sure the audio is turned on (if you shoot a video). The sound is amazing.\"Like the rest of the Rockies, just gaze in awe. Ferocious falls and beautiful green blue lake.....even on a gloomy day........ We stopped on our way back to Banff - definitely worth a visit as you're passing, or a trip out from Jasper.\"\"An interesting geological feature formed by the power of the Athabasca River carving a ravine through the rock over the last period since the Ice Age. The power and volume is impressive. A short walk guides you to the viewing spits, it can be busy. There are excellent viewing points to the North , outside the main car park. Combine this with a slow drive along 93A towards Jasper, thus old road is great for scenery and wildlife.\"It was kind of a rainy day but we decided to see the glaciers and Athabasca Falls. Both were easy to get to and stunning. The Falls are so accessible and so beautiful -- now in the first part of July when there is so much water#! Don't miss out.\"I don't think I can add anything different than what previous reviewers have said, so I'll confirm the consensus that these falls are a definite do not miss!\"\"My son saw the sign for the falls on our way to the site and asked if we could go. It is an easy hike and the falls are very nice. We even got to watch the rafters leave down the back side of the trail. The view was much more spectacular before all of the fences were installed, but common sense is no longer common, so the fences are necessary.\"Don't miss these falls. Its a very easy walk accessible for mostly anyone. The views of the falls are amazing! Take your camera.\"These falls have many parts and it's worth seeing them all. Try to get there early to avoid the crowds. The power of these falls is something else. Read the signs and be careful, too many have not been. Would highly recommend.\"\"We walked all the way to the bottom to stand by the river, and enjoyed every part of the journey down.\"\"Before the visit, I thought it would be just like any other waterfall in Alberta. But once I visited, I was convinced why this tops the list of things to do in Jasper. I don't usually get too excited by waterfalls, but this is so beautiful, violent and amazing. The force of water so enormous and it has carved out the rocks. You can see these falls from different views and all views leads to great experience :). I would really go again and feel the beauty of mother nature.\"You must visit this place. Pretty awesome ewspecially after a lot of rain .A must for keen photographers.A lot of water flows over these falls. Nice. It had just rained and the walkways were a little slippery.\"The Falls have cut changing channels over the centuries and you can walk to the river through which the river no longer flows. They are beautiful all year round, and very different in winter.\"\"Besides being large and complex, this is falls is uniquely beautiful because of the way the blue-green glacial water has carved through many narrow colorful strata of rock. One of a kind. Probably what I liked least is the distance of the falls from home in Virginia, USA\"Great spot for rainbows from the mist coming off the raging water. Lots of things to read about along the trails they have set up for safety. You can safely view the falls from many different angles getting lots of photo's. There are trails up above and down below the falls. It's about 25 kms towards the icefeilds from Jasper. The Mountains keep getting more excellent looking as you approach the ice fields.\"We live in New Zealand, and we thought we had some beautiful waterfalls, but you have to experience Canada for this.\"A short drive from Jasper to this amazing place. Open car park and a short 2 minute walk to the falls (note it does get very busy).A spectacular view of the falls by following them down steam by the canyons. The force of the water is quite loud and amazing to see. Worth seeing!I would definitely stop here to check out the falls. They are beautiful and there are also picnic tables where you can stop to have a meal. Great stop! No cost but you do have to pay to get into the park.\"Although this is a very busy and often crowded place, it is worth at least a quick stop. The falls roar down the canyon, and the start of the falls is pretty with the mountain backdrop. The colors of the layers of rock in the canyon are beautiful. Take the little detour down to the lower lake for another pretty view.\"These falls are a short drive from Jasper and will not disappoint you! The wild churning water makes its' way through the rocks and has carved out some amazing rocks! See what nature is capable of doing! Do not miss this!Thirty kilometres outside Jasper this is well worth a visit. Stunning waterfall and a lovely walk. The scenery is beautiful.\"This is very spectacular, it gives you a respect for time and place. It worth spending an hour working around and admiring the beauty of the falls.\"So much stunning scenery in the Rockies but this is a must see!Easy to access from car park and likely to be very busy from coach tours but most stop long enough to take all the photos you need. Seek out the less obvious views\"This is really easily accessible and only takes about 20 minutes for most to enjoy. It's a great quick stop along your travels and well worth a brief visit.Breathe deeply and live richly...\"\"Easy to walk around and amazing views. Highly recommend spending a while here, you don't have to walk for miles to see it.\"The falls were gorgeous and free from trash and debris unlike some parks. Great photo opportunities are all around the falls.\"These falls are just off the main highway and it is a short, easy walk from the parking lot to the falls. We stopped on the way from Banff to Jasper after being advised to do so. The falls are in a gorgeous setting with the mountains behind. Not as impressive as some we have seen but still worth the visit.\"\"Although not so high, these falls are thunderously powerful so that you can feel the vibration in your body. The walk ways are carefully fenced with plenty of warnings about the danger of straying beyond them along with sad mementos of those who did so and fell to their deaths. We walked the river path and also through the tunnels left from where the river previously pounded through. Fascinating  to see the sculpture of so many years. Beyond the last fall we watched whitewater rafters launch and whizz down river. \"\"we stopped here very early friday morning, was so peaceful, no one were there yet. I suggest to stop by as early as possible\"\"Beautiful falls, showing the power of the water. It was great to be able to get so close. I could have stayed for hours watching and listening to the roar of the falls.\"\"Yes it is a falls of a sort but not as high as expected, but the roar of the falls is wonderful. Visited when it wasn't too crowded so had plenty of places for photos and just to reflect on the rush of water and views.\"\"Beautiful waterfall, quick stop, lots of people. Maybe go early in the morning before it gets busy. Only takes about 1/2 hour to walk around and see the falls and river from different view points.\"The falls themselves are not overly spectacular but the river running below is breathtaking. Would definitely stop especially since access to the falls is close to the parking lot. Not wheelchair accessible.\"Amazing waterfall in the majestic Jasper National Park. A must see!! There are walkways and paths around the canyon that is formed by the waterfall (do NOT climb over the fencing, it is dangerous as the rocks are slippery when wet and tourists have lost their lives in search of the \"\"special photo\"\").\"\"The falls are about 44 miles west of the Icefields Glacier Discover Centre and 20 miles to the east of Jasper. Very easy and convenient path to the falls. There is a 1/2 mile paved trail, with concrete bridges over the gorge. There is an interpretative trail explaining the geography. Very nice stop\"\"Well worth a stop to see these falls. While not the most dramatic of waterfalls, they are in a very pretty setting and still impressive.\"Thoroughly enjoyed this! Stopped here on the way from Jasper to Lake Louise. The Canadian Rocky Mtn. parks department should be commended for the excellent way they have designed the parks so visitors can get the absolute best views in a safe setting. They allow us to get so much closer to the rushing water than we would otherwise be able to do. Kudos to them for the excellent walkways!These fall are easy to get to and handicap accessible. They are beautiful with the mountains surrounding them yet very powerful. There are many opportunities for the photography buffs to take some amazing pics.\"Amazing falls. Just try to get there before the peek hour so you can enjoy them better. Easy walk, very advised.\"\"A quick & easily accessible stop on the side of the road, the mass of water thundering over a short drop & through a narrow chasm is frightening. Keep behind the barriers - there is a memorial to someone who didn't!\"\"We stopped here as part of our tour on the way to Jasper so the only regret was that we didn't have more time here and get to do a proper walk, but what we did see it looked a wonderful place. Well worth a visit just allow yourself more time here, we were restricted for time because of the tour and being in a group.\"\"It was a gorgeous day when we arrived at this stop on our Rockies tour. The bright sunshine with the snowy peaks as a backdrop was stunning.As you walk from the car park your ears are confronted with a cacophony of noise like thunder. Suddenly you catch glimpses of the river through the trees. As you walk on the noise gets louder and louder and then \"\"BAM\"\" you see the awesome sight of the falls in all their glory.There are several really good photo spots where you can snap the falls from different angles.A beautiful picturesque spot.Another awesome location.Canada sure knows how to spoil you!!!\"\"The whole Jasper park is a gem, including Athabasca fall. Views are spectacular, even after seeing many falls within I asked and Banff.\"\"We visited a visitor center in Banff, and this was one of the places he highlighted on our map. Wow. What incredible beauty!\"Definitely worth a visit being just off the main Route 93. Lots to see from different perspectives from the falls through the canyon and out into calmer turquoise waters.Make sure to walk all the trails through the rocks where the river once ran. From the parking lot you can walk in 3 minutes to the head of the falls.\"what a fantastic place to visit that will inspire you and delight you, you will have endless place along the route to take some fantastic photos of this awesome place\"Very fierce waterfall. Can view from many spots. Worth a look. About a 30 minute drive from Jasper. Well signed. Allow 30-60 minutes.\"There are lots of waterfalls to see when touring the area but this is one worth seeing. Interesting range of features to see such as old route of falls lots of viewing areas big falls there is a back road at end of road which is not \"\" rough\"\" as the sign suggest. Interesting road less travelled and differ t views to see. We saw black bear on this track and it also leads to turn off just before Jasper to Edith Cavell Glacier for us a highlight. The road to the Glacier is tight but we saw black bear and grizzly in the morning (after 9.00am so not too early from Jasper)\"\"Cloudy day, but the falls were beautiful and easy to walk to with several overlooks. There was a sign saying that American Dippers (a very cool unusual small bird who swims in mountain streams) was present. We found one up river from the falls. Great site!\"\"If you love to see the power of mother nature in water, its a must see. Lots of different and good viewing spots.\"About twenty minutes from Jasper. Can be visited before you arrive to Jasper or after you leave Jasper on your way to Banff.Breathtaking! Can be crowded.our guide was full of knowledge so he told us lots of stories about this place. Amazing to see and would recommend a visit.\"These falls show the true power of water, its amazing .beautiful setting worth a visit. there are walk trails along the river were you can study the full flow of the river\"\"We really enjoyed our time at the falls. I had only visited with a person in a wheelchair previously and so viewing options were very limited but this time I was able to wander to all parts of the falls. There are lots of informative notice boards so can understand the history, nature, and safety issues. Well worth seeing including the stairway to the lower canyon.\"We visited the Athabasca Falls this morning and walked round the pathways. It was absolutely beautiful and we loved every moment. Well worth the stop.\"Athabasca and Sunwapta falls are well worth the stop. Short hikes that everyone can make. Spend an entire day driving the Icefields parkway between Banff and Jasper, it is awesome.\"The falls are so close to the road. And you only have to walk about two minutes to get to them after parking. Beautiful river and falls. A nice gentle hike. Even those who don't like heights should be able to enjoy these falls. The water sounds relaxing and beautiful.\"A short walk from the car park, the falls are small but very powerful. The canyon is well worth seeing and there are some very interesting short trails.H which make a very unusual photograph.ighly recommend going to the lowest trail to the beach where there at least 20 stone man statues\"The fall is very close to parking lot. We walked around the fall a little bit and found it to be really beautiful. It won't take one hour to see the whole area. Nice.\"This is a beautiful waterfall with nearby looped hiking that leads through a small canyon with viewpoints of the river. It is a bit tough to walk around especially if there are a lot of people or if you have mobility difficulties, but it is overall paved. The water is incredibly blue here and it is fun to see several different things (falls, river, canyon) in the area rather than just one attraction.\"\"We stopped at Athabasca Falls on our drive to Lake Louise AB from Jasper AB. We stopped early in the morning and pretty much had the place to ourselves. Very pretty Falls, the color of the water never stops amazing me! Worth the stop and free!\"\"The Athabasca Falls are absolutely something to see. The color of the water might make you think you were in the Caribbean, but a cold wind brings you right back to Canada.\"\"Athabasca Falls are a beautiful, not-to-missed falls in Jasper National Park. Not just the falls but the whole area with the various lookouts, the small canyon down to the Athabasca River is just beautiful. Tends to be quite busy and crowded but well worth the visit.\"\"walkway is on the far interior end, and parking lot is 2 levels, ground is uneven, 3 viewpoints only 1 of which has the falls. Some uphill walking, \"\"stairs\"\" are 1 set of stairs and the rest are broken rocks, it can be done, but take your time, go slow, the place was PACKED and its every man for himself there, oh, and pit toilets- pretty bad.\"\"Worth the trip to see the might of the river flowing through the gorge and the colour of the water, truly amazing and so beautiful\"Always awe inspiring even though we have been here many times over the last 30 years. This fall is very near from the highway. The water level was high during this visit. The surrounding views are beautiful. There is always a crowd here. Plenty of photography viewpoints. On certain occasions rainbows can be seen in the water vapors thrown out by the waterfall.\"We travelled Alberta starting in Athabasca, then Edmonton, and into the Rockies to Jasper, Lake Louise, Banf, and out to Calgary. The stop at Athabasca Falls was well worth it, beautiful site and nice walking paths. If you're making the trip between Jasper and Lake Louise, make this stop.\"We paid a brief visut to this spot on tour but enjoyed its beauty and magnifence. The variety of colour and clarity of the water make a great place to visit.\"The Falls are between Jasper and the Columbia Icefield -- it was a nice spot to walk around and there are some rafting trips that are there. I would recommend if you have time taking the \"\"back road\"\" to Jasper for some awesome glacial lakes and side roads that are lovely and a little quieter. LOTS of people here when we were here (the busiest spot besides the icefield on our trip)\"\"We visited while travelling between Lake Louise and Jasper and were very glad that we did, it's just at the side of the road but would have been quite a trip from Jasper. Well worth it anyway, very beautiful place and some nice gentle hikes here.\"Jasper national park was very scenic and the Athabasca falls was spectacular. One can visit any number of times and still not get enough!\"The fall together with the rainbow looked breathtakingly beautiful.Overall it was an amazing experience\"Do not miss this. It will be crowded. The colors and sights around are great. We combined this with the ice fiieldsAwesome a must see stopped there on way home loved being there scenery and falls are breathtaking I can also hike down and come up to a lake with outstanding viewsThis was worth a stop for us. Despite being busy it was really a beautiful place to see. The viewing platforms are well designed and with a quick walk you can see the river below the falls too. I can see this would definitely be crazy busy in July and August though.Don't miss this stop on the Icefields Parkway! Easy parking and stunning views. The falls will inspire you with their beauty and overwhelm you with the power of water.\"Lovely views, easy walking (just be careful not to slip!) and great photo opportunities. The interpretive guide plaques are interesting to read.Heed the warnings and do not go off the paths - it is not worth the risk to your life.\"Beautiful. The scenery up to the falls is breathtaking. The falls are just fabulous. Great photo opportunity. Remember to take your camera and video recorder and water. There are no shops en route.Have seen a few water falls across the world in my time and this is an average spectacle of water and its power. The falls are easily accessible from the car park and have well laid out pathways around the various angles that you can view them. The day we visited it had been raining so the water was high and the falls were in full force - look out for the cut outs that the water has created in the canyon walls\"Worth spending a little time to see. Spectacular. Accessible. Memorable. See it when it is sunny and bright, or cloudy and snowy as it was when we saw it.\"Make sure you go to the lower falls area too! It takes about 15-20min but well worth your time. There is a small beach area at the lower falls\"The walk is short to the falls and has some interesting rock formations. There are some stairs on either side of the falls.A gem!\"\"If your driving past, you need to hop out and have a look. The power of the water is amazing and the colour of the water never gets old to look at. Nice spot to stop for a lunch and take a 2km walk after lunch down to the bottom of the falls\"An amazing view from every bridge! We did about half the trek. Not for folks in moderately shape. I would suggest paying for guided hike so you can experience all of the falls if you dont walk to walk the whole length if falls back up to your car.Stopped with a tour group and was so happy we did. This is a beautiful waterfall and area. It's convenient and right off the main road and you could see most in 20 minutes if you are in a hurry.Interesting to see the power of the river as it carved out the rock. Short walk to see and hear the falls shouldn't be missed.So nice to have this scenic stop within walking distance!! This is a must see when traveling the Icefields Parkway!These were some of the more awe-inspiring waterfalls in this area. Quite majestic! It was neat that stairs were created down the old waterways so you can see up close how the water shaped the rock. I enjoyed feeling the pounding of the water and the refreshing mist (best vantage point on the other side of the bridge to the left).These stunning falls are well worth a visit. Visually beautiful they remind you of the power of nature! Great photo opportunity of a fabulous feature of the Canadian Rockies! You must see them whilst in the area. Highly recommended!\"Worth a visitIn a watery landscape these are a must visit. As everywhere here, the paths are well cared for, litter free, and all seem rather understated.\"\"It is different from the other parts of Banff with special \"\"land scape\"\". I love it and spent some time taking pictures. The fall itself is not that great, but it is good as a whole.\"\"Really enjoyed the walk, great photo opportunities, lots of places to explore and really friendly people. Make sure you pack some warm layers..\"\"We had poor weather when we visited Athabasca falls but it was spectacular despite the this. The rain made for a powerful surge of water coming through this narrow gorge, great photo opportunity. Ample car parking facilities, well worth a stop on our road trip.\"The Athabasca falls are just off Highway 93 near Jasper. The falls are breathtaking and extremely interesting. Access to the different viewing spots provides fantastic photo opportunities. One of our favorite stops on our trip.\"...what else can you say to the water coming down from melting ice glaciers..trails were marked and hiking was not too taxing..great find!\"\"Stopped here briefly on our way to Jasper, it looked beautiful in the rain. There are several overlooks along the paved walk way to stop and admire the view.\"\"Worth a stop, right off the highway, very convenient. Wonderful trails all around the top to bottom of the falls.Please stay on the trails...\"Make sure you visit this site. It is really one of natures great wonders. Some walking but very accessible for most.The falls are spectacular!!! It's a short and easy hike to the several vantage points. Stop at each one for a different angle of these beautiful falls.\"The falls themselves are not massive, but still seem quite spectacular, but it is more the surrounding area that evelates this as a great place to visit. The water is so incredibly blue (depending upon the time of year you visit) and there are well laid out paths, with informative information boards. Easy to spedn a few hours wandering around and taking it all in.\"The falls are beautiful! There are paved walking trails with written information at points of interest. The falls are just off the icefields parkway. I highly recommend stopping in to view the falls. You won't be disappointed.The amount and power of the water is very impressive. Several different viewing spots give a lot of photo ops. This was not my favorite stop on the Ice Fields Parkway but was the best waterfalls that we saw.\"Unbelievable amount of water rushes right by you here and the noise is deafening. The access to the falls is easy and plenty of cueing platforms despite the crowds, loved this place!!!!!\"Athabasca Falls is where the falls passes through various channels and the water is absolutely amazing colors of blue/green where the water passes through the various canyon channels. This is right off the highway is easily accessible and has plenty of free parking. It really is one of the coolest stops that you will find and a great picture photo opportunity place.\"Visitors get a sense of the impermanence of their lives as they view the vast falls which will be around long after we are all gone. The awe inspiriting mist clouds spray up to create a moist atmosphere that plays with the light, making pictures all the more pretty. Of all the falls in the area, this was my absolute favorite!\"\"We visited after some heavy rain and the water coming down over the falls greatly increased. The power and strength of the water is literally awesome, and the scenery and views are stunning\"Amazing how the swirling water has rounded out some of the rocks. Lots of photo opportunity. Toilet facilities by parking lot and drinking waterThe sheer power of the water is amazing. It is easy to move around the various view points. To see how the water has eroded the rock over time is really awesome.The falls were awesome. I had no idea how great they would be. There is a short 20 minute loop walk where you can see and HEAR the falls. We did not go on the longer trails but the loop walk was well worth visiting.Well worth stopping off and visiting this area. The surroundings have not been spoiled too much even though it is a very popular tourist attraction. The falls are stunning and show the real power of nature. Signage and information quite good but public toilets are revolting holes in the floor with awful smells!\"Definitely worth a visit, spectacular. Fantastic waterfalls but make sure you use the loo prior to arriving as the on site ones left you gagging for breath. Don't let that put you off though.\"I love the mountains! I love the falls. I just didn't like the vandals left by some inconsiderate tourists. I can stay here to relax my mind. I dont think I will get tired of looking at the falls and the mountainThis was our first stop on our way from Jasper to Lake Louise. The weather was not ideal but the beauty of the falls were spectacular nonetheless. Plenty of places to take photos and view the natural beauty on offer. Definitely make a stop here.\"Not the highest falls that you have ever seen but the water does come through a very small gap and is pretty impressive. Good car park, close to the falls and with pristine toilet facilities. Great viewing positions.\"\"Stopped here on my way out of Jasper heading to Banff. I hit it early in the morning so there weren't any crowds (or tour buses). Very easy, short hike to check out these spectacular falls. Definitely worth a stop; give yourself at least 30 minutes to take in the beauty.\"After reading reviews here I knew we wanted to be sure to stop while in the area. We were not disappointed we did. We walked down to the bottom and up to the top - beautiful from any view point.Waterfall is located on Hway 93 when traveling from Jasper to Lake Louise. Well signed. The only negative in visiting this point of interest is there is a 250 m walk which could be difficult for individuals with mobility issues. Great photo op. No entrance fee.The view is awesome and breathtaking to see Mother Nature at its picturesque the sounds of the waters rushing through the canyon wow\"You cannot visit Jasper with stopping here. We went in late November so nothing was ploughed, just make sure you have good winter gear and boots that come up to your knees and you will be fine. It was well worth the effort to see the part frozen falls.\"An awesome experience. The supreme power of nature is in full evidence during the visit. The vantage points are superbly positioned to watch ' Mother Nature' in all her glory.\"Visited in June 2016. Loved the falls and it was easily accessible.The canyon is beautiful, Will visit again.\"\"The nature is so serene. This falls is amazing. There is a small trail too and can view falls via canyon.Attached are pics.\"\"The falls are beautiful but for me the best part was going down the canyon towards the riverbank, where the beach is covered with hundreds of inukshuks people have made. This is the perfect place to have some lunch and look out over the river as it exits the canyon.\"I had 3 other companions when we traveled towards Calgary and the driver stopped here for us to have a walk and see the falls. I can only write that it has not got old looking at these deep canyons and stunning waterfalls. Thus one did not disappoint. Please take the time go view the falls and you will not be disappointed.\"Call in plenty of advance, they do require a min 3 night stay in the on season. request cabin 3,6,8, everytime i go its always sad to check out.\"I love waterfalls and this one is great. It's does not have views coming down from the mountains but it's great anyway. You can watch it go through the caverns and heard the water levels change so with the water level up I bet it would be spectacular. It's just off the road so not. Much walking involved. Definitely worth the stop!Don't know why I have never stopped here before? So beautiful... short 2 minute walk to the falls so it is suitable for all ages. There are other hikes that can go much further down the canyon but I did not go.. The area can be slippery so be careful and the falls are powerful so watch the little ones... if you went over the railings I think you would be a goner for sure.Amazing experience. Visited twice and enjoyed both times. Amusing signs that were also informative. Got some great photos.\"Make sure this is on your list of things to do in Jasper. Through time, water has carved itself a deep path through rocks and mixed in with that blue blue water, this place is a must see. They even made cement stairs that go through some of these tall rock carved areas which was really cool to walk through and touch. Lots of photo spots along the way and easy to access once you park, no hike needed.\"\"If you are travelling highway 93 between Jasper and Banff or only staying in Jasper this is a worthwhile stop off. The power of the falls is impressive and it's location is beautifulFrom the parking lot it is a short walk to the falls and some short hikes to get different view points above or below the falls. A fence was built to stop people going out onto the wet, slippery rocks to get a photo or selfie but it seems that every year someone climbs over of goes around the fence, slips on the rocks and is killed. You can take highway 93 to and from the falls but highway 93A between Jasper and the falls is much quieter and gives the chance to visit Mt Edith Cavell.\"The falls are easily accessible and are particularly good in the late spring. They can be viewed from many different angles. There is also a hiking trail.Many varied views of the falls and deep chasms. Go early as it gets very crowded. Many of the walkways are paved with bridges across the falls with varied views.\"I liked this stop on the IceField Parkway as the falls are not a long hike from the parking lot. In fact they are really no hike at all, no special footwear needed. It's easy for handicapped and elderly persons to see a spectacular view. The viewing areas are so well done and allow you to see the falls on one side and beautiful serene mountain lake on the other. Well worth the stop.\"Gorgeous views of carved waterfalls. Trails are easy to maneuver. You are rewarded with great pictures but be prepared to encounter a lot of tourists.The Athabasca falls are a 5-8 min drive from most hotels in Jasper. There is a nice walking trail around the falls. The falls\"Although this waterfall will not qualify as world class in height & width, the sheer power of the Athabasca River narrowing & flowing through this narrow chasm is awesome especially as seen right from the brink. It is a must see when traveling the Icefields Parkway.\"\"This was a surprising, delightful site. It was very accessible and well planned. We could have stayed much longer, just admiring the view.\"About 20 kilometers out of Jasper on the Icefields Parkway. Relatively easy walk with nice views of the falls from different angles.On the trip to view the Canadian Rockies. Lovely fall but not the best. Niagara Falls is the clear winner. The plus side: Weather is good. Not so crowded. Facilities are very clean.Definitely have your camera ready. The falls are beautiful. Definitely take the short hike to the bottom too. Scenery is amazing and the colour of the water is stunning. Only 30kms from Jasper too.\"We stopped at these falls on ur way from Banff to Jasper, and so glad we did. The scenery and falls our outstanding. its an easy walk, a lot of information written at viewpoints, and again easy free parking. Dont firget your camera!!\"\"There are two points to travel to: the lower and upper falls. Both are doable, however you do need to be able to hike to especially get to the upper one. Lots of people were there as we visited on a public holiday. Some posing Chipmunks on the way up - added to the enjoyment. make sure you go into the cave on the first fall. Some paths are narrow, especially when busy and quite wet in places.\"Lots of good vantage points. (some rainbows in cascade ). Easy walk; some steps to go down/climb back to go below falls. Beautiful blue water. Rocks and foliage are very good. Pretty good site for photographers. Obey warnings to not go beyond fence. Adequate restrooms. Can get crowded.\"The Athabasca Falls are truly spectacular. The boardwalk trail which leads to the lower level of the falls is well maintained. There are quite a few stairs here but it's worth the effort. I'm no photographer but the images of the falls on my ipad are just stunning. The day we visited there was a National Parks representative on the walkway between the carpark and the Falls with pelts from local wildlife. We stopped and had a look and spoke at length with this young man who was extremely informative about local wildlife and history. We found the Park Rangers in attendance at many popular spots around Jasper and I must say I think it's a wonderful initiative! As I say, there are quite a few stairs so if you have mobility issues you may just view the Falls from the top. There are a few seats scattered around up there too.\"\"Easy access, safe and good location of the highway. Could us a bit of update and some control of runoff.\"Several nice views of the Athabasca Falls are available around the site. Lots of parking. Parts of the walkway can be slippery in the rain.The falls are a really short walk from the parking lot. In winter the frozen waterfall is amazing and it even looks good in summer. The trail to the falls is short and the viewing point picturesque. Make sure u bring a camera and a selfie stick because you are going to want to take a snap.\"Called in near the end of our road trip to Jasper. Parking was good and some basic toilets on the site . Well signed information boards informative and helpful . The falls were in full flow so worth the stop . We were surprised that it was quite busy , we stayed about 30 mins as we were dropping off our hire car in Jasper .\"\"We enjoyed stopping by the Falls, walking through the area, & watching the power of these falls. The water is beautiful & the rock formations formed by the water are awesome.\"Stopped here whilst driving the Icefields Parkway to Jasper.The falls are just off the main highway and well signposted. There is a large free car park.You approach the falls by heading towards the river and then follow hard surfaced paths alongside the falls down several levels as far as the river if you wish.A lovely natural wonder well worth visiting.A must do... Ale walk around for great views... Not too hard to walk around... About 1 hours to go around if you don't stop too much for pictures...It took us 1 1/2 hours... Very nice ...Another spectacular work of nature. A nice easy trail to get multiple views of the wonders of the world at it's best. Totally awe inspiring. Definitely worth a side trip.\"Definitely stop and enjoy this spectacular sight of Mother Nature, you will not be disappointed. Lots of viewing points to enjoy Falls,\"When we visited there was quite a lot of water going over the falls so they looked at there best probably. Well constructed walkways means that you can get up close to see the force of the falls.A good stop off point half way between Lake Louise and Jasper.\"The Athabasca falls are pretty incredible. Take the time to learn the history of the falls and it makes them even more appreciated. The gorge which has formed is amazing, the walking paths have made viewing this treasure very accessible for everyone. Great place stop in your travels and spend some time admiring the power of these falls and what they have created. There is nice picnic areas and facilities.\"Always spectacular! Enjoyable as always only thing there were places hard to get a gòd view to busload of tourists with their self sticks and cameras but I quess that is one of the challenge of a high tourist spot. Just wish they could have been more considerate instead of blocking and pushing. Oh well! Sigh. Well worth seeing or showing someone who has never seen it. It is always beautiful.Incredible! Make sure to stop at these magnificent falls. Take time to view it from all the various view points.This is one of the must see places on the Icefield Parkway... worth a visit on a road trip to Jasper. Its awesome.But... it is a heavily managed tourist hot spot... If you want something a little bit less beaten track then go further along the 93 to Mistaya Canyon...I love waterfalls & this one should not be missed. Very conveniently located right off the Icefields Parkway.You'll need at least 30 to 45 minutes to take in all of the paths to see both the top and the bottom of these magnificent falls. The rock strata made visible by the water cut is worth a close look. It's a 'must do' in Jasper National Park.Stunning. PMake a great picture post card. The falls were in full flight with the melting snow. The roaring of the water over the falls could be heard for miles. The falls. Drop off in a number of places along the canyon until it drops down into a wider part of the river. Well worth hiking along the trails beside the falls.\"I try to review places with an eye for those less-abled, I feel there's not enough info sometimes. You can see a lot of the upper falls via accessible trails, but for the lower falls and the lake, you need to be fairly fit. This is a place worth stopping!! Plenty of washrooms, parking may be an issue during high season (May & Sept are shoulder season). I suggest to do the stairs/light short hike to the beach, if you're able, the views are breathtaking\"Athabasca Falls is located within Jasper National Park on the upper Athabasca River just south of Jasper on the Icefield Highway. Allow at least one hour here as the scenery is gorgeous & there are plenty of opportunities to take some inspiring landscape photo's. The Athabasca Falls is a waterfall where the Athabasca River funnels into a wild running gorge just metres from the car park. There is a timber boardwalk which meanders along the gorge & a path which goes deeper into the canyon. There is ample parking available & toilet's. A great place to spot to stretch the legs if driving along the Icefield Highway.On the road between Jasper and Lake Louise and every tour operator will stop here and for a very good reason. Everyone likes a good waterfall.\"What a magnificent view of nature at its most powerful, tonnes of water cascading over the rocks , the noise water spray all combine to give you a wow feeling\"The falls were spectacular. It is worth spending around 30 mins here. Many scenic pictures to be taken here. Be careful not to cross the barriers/edges though.\"Super view of the falls and you can walk down to the canyon bottom, which isn't all that far. Mostly paved so suitable for all. Drop toilets in the car park, bit smelly but ok. Worth a stop on your journey.\"Very beautiful place to visit and just off the hifgway making it easy to get to but very busy as well...\"Those athabasca waterfalls are very nice, and it comes on the icefield parkway, about 40 km outside jasper.Ther are 2 falls that comes together and nice lake and canyon down to them.Its a nice break on 93 highway, and place to see.\"Allot of fun for the family. it was a nice small hike with great views. If you are an outdoors type person it is worth the small walk.The falls are only a short distance walk from the car and bus parking area and are well worth taking the 20 minutes to walk there and back and see how all the melt water from the Athabasca River falls into a very steep but short chasm.Lovely clean place to visit. Beautifull views of the falls. An easy walk with steps to the falls. Beautifull example of washing machine whirling pool.The sound from these falls are fearsome and at least 2 young men have died by not keeping to the designated path.Athabasca is a stunning display of the power of water as it rushes through narrow channels. It is a short walk from the parking lot with easy access to various viewing vantage points. We found time to make 2 trips during our stay at Jasper.\"Don't miss this! If you're into photography, you'll be rewarded. And even if you're not into photography, the site is breathtaking!\"\"A must see on your travels to Jasper National Park. Could get quite busy on a nice day, but well worth the visit.\"Loads to see. Easy walking and interesting information about the history of the falls. Walked up river through the woods and back down past the falls. All accessibleI'm used to backcountry hiking. Seen better falls. It's easy access by car and worth the get a quick photo taken. Then off for coffee or fight the crowed.Well worth the stop. There are multiple view points and many information boards. We were there late in the afternoon in May. It could get real crowded in the high season.Well worth the stop as the falls were nice. It was a short walk to the falls and we walked down to the area below the falls which was worth doing. All in all it was a nice place to get out and stretch.\"It's not just the Falls but the deep and incredibly narrow canyon below the falls. The river had cut a canyon but unusually the hard rock won out and eventually it overflowed, redirected and cut the deep canyon which can be seen today. This is presumably because of the spring floods with glacial melt water (millions of years ago?). A rare example of rock beats water. You can walk the old canyon too. Another amazing fact is the fish above and below the falls which is way too high to be passed. Presumable early First Nations introduced some trout above the falls for ease of fishing and to spread the valuable food source. An example of early farming?\"\"Very beautiful place, lots of hiking trails, breathtaking panorama's, fun and educative place to show natural aspects to children\"\"The water falls are incredible. It is just memorizing to see the power that water can have. A must see stop for anyone traveling to,Jasper\"'Falls' in Canada can mean anything from big rapids to actual waterfalls. This is thankfully the later and is quite impressive. Nice walk round and over the falls.We stopped here on the way back to Jasper from the Columbia Ice Fields. Really interesting stop and the falls were gorgeous. Well worth the brief detour!The wide Athabasca River becomes a funnel and just powers thru the falls in 3 different levels. Awesome power. Great to see where nature has chosen different paths over time. It makes you realise that these features have been around for a very long time. Easy walking to all levels although there are some steps to the lower level.\"The walk to and bridges across the falls offer a great view (and photo op) of the river, falls and canyon. Highly worthwhile stop if traveling in this area as the walk to the falls is less than 5 min from the car park. A slightly longer walk takes you to the bottom of the canyon thru which the falls have cut.\"This is about 40 mins towards jasper from banff. very beautiful. Good for a quick stop and stretch off the legsStopped to see the falls and they did not disappoint. They were loud and pretty. Can do quite quickly and plenty of photo ops.\"What a great place. Fantastic scenery as the water cascades over the falls, causing almost a vortex effect at the top. Just don't climb on to the rocks and avoid the toilets!\"The rushing of the falls was an incredible site! Spent at least an hour just walking around and taking in the beauty of the river and the views.\"Athabasca falls is a 45 minute drive from the town of Jasper National Park, west of Icefield Parkway. Known for its force rather than its height, it's the most impressive falls in the Rockies.\"My wife and I loved Athabasca Falls... God is a great creator....blessed to see it! Would love to bring the kids back.\"We visited the falls on a rainy, cloudy, day, but it didn't detract from the experience. The falls are not particularly high or wide, but are still beautiful. Parks Canada have done an excellent job of placing viewing platforms and walk ways to give excellent views, and there are informative signs dotted around. The falls are a must see if you visit Jasper, whatever the weather.\"\"A really well set out trek around the falls with lots of informative notices telling you all about the falls and its surroundings. Easy to walk around, although there are some parts with lots of steps. A great way to spend an hour or two.\"A great way to spend part of a day in Jasper and it's free! Stunning views and many great photo ops. A must see while in JasperWe had relatives visiting from Ontario. We took them to the Athabasca Falls. They were amazed at the force of the water and the beauty of the falls. It satisfied everyone aged 6 to 45. I visit the falls every time I'm in Jasper. It's worth seeing every time.Another beautiful and part of the Rockies and every time you have he chance take the short walk (very easy walking) and see the grandeur of these falls regardless of the season.These falls are amazing and worth the stop. Allow time for the walk around and explore all the trails on offer\"On the drive back to Banff from Jasper, we stopped at the Athabasca falls. Best decision ever! Thunderous falls you will be shaken when you learn how some young adults lost their lives here. Do be careful and don't be tempted to cross any barriers. Very picturesque.\"You must go and look at the falls. They are amazing. Plenty of excellent camera opportunities. Wonderful.\"Visited plenty of falls and another good one,more at sights and views and nice peaceful location, a good day out\"Icefields Parkway has many many delights in store but make sure you include this one...a great fall through the narrow canyonWe live a few hours away so have gone here often and at many different times of the year. It is very different at times. A good 15-30 minute break on a beautiful drive down the ice field parkwayThese falls are truly awesome to see. Great to walk around and see them from different angles. A photographers paradise.If you are driving the Icefield Parkway then Athabasca Falls is definitely worth stopping to take a look. It's only a short distance off the Parkway with good parking and facilities. The falls are not huge but the river has cut spectacular formations into the rock. There are lots of information boards to point out all the interesting features. It probably won't be the highlight of your day but you'll be glad you stopped by.We are very glad we stopped here. The water and scenery is just breathtaking. Make sure you follow the path that takes you to the canyon. It's only about a 5 minutes walk and it's really beautiful in there.\"Definitely worth a visit lovely quaint place we took this visit part of a tour with other guests staying at the hotel, you can book almost anywhere in town.\"\"A short drive from Jasper. We were there around noon. The guy we bought sandwiches from promised us there wouldn't be lots of people there, but there like 12 tour buses of high school kids there. The parking lot was nice. The water fell off of the rocks. It was a little loud. Lots of smokers, which made the smell of the falls a lot less enjoyable.Not wheelchair accessible.\"\"We almost passed by this assuming it was just another water fall. However, the way it has cut into the rock makes it interesting and a special stop.\"\"If you going to Jasper, make sure you visit this place. It's a little less than an hour drive from downtown. If you see wildlife along the way, it's a bonus.When you get to the parking area, there were multiple Washrooms and picnic tables.A little walk to the falls, lot's stairs and rails. Be careful on some tight spots of the area.Wonderful views from different locations. Very relaxing.\"\"We went early in the morning before the tour buses arrived and it felt like we were the only ones on earth. Beautiful views from every angle, quiet, listened to the birds and rushing water together; harmony in nature. This is worth the stop. Go EARLY.\"\"good accessibility, stairs to most levels, protective rails, toilets were in good shape, it was still frozen when I went and water volume low in early spring but still a must see.\"A great place to hike and walk through dry canyons and go to the bottom and build with rocks. Don't forget your camera but stay behind the fences as some have not and are no longer around to tell the tale of it's grandure july 2013Not far from the main road this river and falls make an impressive scenery with beautiful views of background mountains. Water falls in different places in different angles making it beautiful to watch from different places. The area is well constructed allowing people to cross the river to the other side to see the fall in different angle. A must see attraction in the area.Athabasca Falls is one of the sights you have to see if you are in the Jasper area. Every time I visit Jasper (which has been a lot!) I have stopped here. The falls are rushing and quite impressive. Mount Kerkeslin acts as the amazing backdrop to the falls adding even more awe. The bridge and paths are located very close to the waterfall providing great vantage points for viewing.\"Walked through the path to see how the giant potholes were formed, the water looking so beautiful from were to fell heavily and to the stream right after the canyon were it was calm. Beautiful experience\"Just happened upon these falls. They are probably one of he nicest falls I have ever seen. Well kept area. Many viewing areas. Spectacular with mountains in the background.First time in Alberta and had to go and see these falls it was a bit of a hike as we were staying in Radium Hot Springs BC (5 hours away). We decided to do an overnight to Jasper National Park and were really excited to get to see these Falls. The color of the water is so unique (blue/green) and really clear. There are plenty of signs explaining the history and geographically content of the Falls. No very crowded when we were there as there was still ice and snow on some of the trails (many were closed still from winter). Plan to spend at least an hour with lots of picture taking opportunities.\"The first time I traveled to Jasper park was in the summer, the water was raging and the falls were breathtaking .. and I am from Alaska, so it takes a lot to impress me! .. I have been there in Fall and also early spring. During the early spring trip the water was frozen, therefore leaving Malign Canyon dry! .. Which was also very cool, because you can climb into it in some locations and get a different perspective on how deep it really is. Also, spring time is less crowded as i only ran into one other person on the entire hike!\"\"When you are surrounded by spectacular nature, what is another gem? Great 15 minute trip out from the Jasper townsite, you pass stunning vistas to get to Athabasca falls. It is amazing to see how water has carved rock over the years. Climb down the path to the lower viewing area to see the beautiful green water on the other side of the falls.\"Hiked around Athabasca Falls and admired the scenery. The falls are great example of nature's handiwork over the thousands of years. A nice easy walk for those not wanting something too challenging.\"The falls are a short walk from the carpark which is usually full of tourist buses so go early.Watching the force of the falls thunder into the canyon is amazing, but stay on the trails as it is very slippery and dangerous.It is also very cold around the falls so wear warm clothes.\"\"We stopped here with our dog. It was a nice 15 minute or so drive from jasper down highway 93A very impressive drive. Once we got there there was only 4 other cars so we pretty much had the whole place to ourselves and the water was really slowing even tho it was quite chilly out, always worth a visit anyway\"Easy walk to falls and the mountains all around it...the sound of water falling down gives you peace....it was just wonderful placeOur family visited here to show my mother-in-law the falls. I had special ice grippers for our shoes which had been very handy during past winter excursions but they were practically unnecessary at the end of March. This site is well maintained and outhouses are clean and full of paper and sanitizer.I enjoyed the falls. It just amazing the force of the water. I have visited here on many trips to Jasper. Easy walk.\"Beautiful scenery. Short walk from parking area. Easy drive, well marked directions. Would recommend.\"One of my Favorite quick visits when in Jasper. The falls can be spectacular in the spring. A must see!!\"I suspect the seasons can make for different experiences here but this is a simples stop for a bathroom break and a stretch with a view. It's 90 seconds to walk to the falls form the lot. The falls are basic and not great viewing despite considerable view points being built out. It's just the nature of the falls, they are hard to get a great view. It could be that the walk down the canyon is ok, but it was closed. The cramped space and all the people and the lack of exciting falls and lack of great views made this a total bust for me. I can barely recommend it except for maybe people, with kids. Young kids.\"Have been to many falls - bigger and much more vicious. Something about this one just blew me away. Got there just before the snow had melted completely so was not in full force yet the water was quite powerful and very green. A must visit. Not very busy when we went there so we had most of the falls to ourselves. What a treat.Wonderful place to visit. A little tricky in the spring as part of the path down to the lake was closed due to ice.\"I have been to many waterfalls and athabasca falls to me is average and mediocre. The falls themselfs are only around 60 feet high and partially obstructed by the rock canyon, there always seems to be lots of people at these falls so there is a lot of bumping shoulders. The nature walk down to the river is nice.\"This is well worth the trip to make the visit. Lots of different views of the falls and many panel boards discussing various factual tidbits on how they were formed.\"Decided this would be a great stop to have a snack and stretch our legs. Traveling with a teen, pre teen, and a five year old. This area was easily accessible. It was gorgeous, between the frozen parts of the falls and blue colors of the water it made for great pictures.\"We had a look here one day. Beautiful.

Right off the highway, lots of parking and amazing blue green water pours from the falls!\"\"we were last here in 1981 on our honeymoon and thought it was closer to town! but the drive was lovely. we had to park on the road because the parking lot was closed (not maintained during the winter season) and the walk was a little sketchy because of the ice, but very worth the time. there are lots of interpretive signs and view points. definitely worth the drive.\"\"I love these falls! There's a nice easy walk around and it's absolutely beautiful (as is anywhere in the Rockies).

It's beautiful.\"The falls are a great attraction to visit while in the Jasper area.

Also make sure you bring suitable footwear as the paths can be wet and muddy.Stunning in the winter! Such a beautiful sight to see! Although it can be a little dangerous walking around as all the paths were covered with ice. Definitely worth the beautiful drive from Jasper!The roaring and the mist of the falls gave us refreshing feeling after a long way drive through Icefield Parkway from Lake Louise.\"Beautiful falls surrounded by carved rocks, forest, and mountains. The sprays from the waterfall will form rainbows on a sunny day. It is a easy walk around with lots of beauty to admire.\"\"Absolutely loved our hike here! Bring your camera and take your time. So much beauty to enjoy. We went without a map, and tried looking online for it part way through, to find spotty service haha.

Also, dress in layers, most areas are shaded\"Take a half an hour or half a day to explore these beautiful Falls. An easy walk to get up close and personal.\"Visited here with a tour group.

Clean area as well so its a great place to spend time.\"The Athabasca Falls are not very large, nor have a great height, but are very picturesque and the white foaming waters and the deep, narrow canyon after the falls offer great photo opportunities. You can cross over to the other side of the falls by the pedestrian bridge across the canyon for a different view.\"Yet another stunning spot to stop off and take photos. The colour of the water is incredible with interesting rock formations that the water streams through.\"Went once in the fall & now in the winter, alittle icey walk in but the falls are beautiful to see with all the ice & crystal blue water.

Well worth the stop as the winter falls are stunning ice formations.\"Had a great time visiting is July. Lots of people but the Falls are worth it. Would recommend going all the way down to the outlet, beautiful caverns to walk through.\"This was my second trip to the falls in winter and it didn't seem to be as icy as it was the last time. The stairs to the lower falls was roped off with a DO NOT ENTER sign. A beautiful sight and well worth visitng\"Came across this along ice field parkway . Parking available and just a short walk to the falls lookouts. Quite cool around the falls, needed a jumper.

The falls are wildly beautiful and is a must see.stunning sight..totally loved it.we took loads of pictures.there were restrooms close by.a must visit.\"The difference in water flow between spring, fall and winter is amazing. The water never stops because of the weight and friction of an ice sheet glacier at the Columbia Ice fields. No admittance charges as long as you have the standard National Park Pass. Do not stop if you see four or more tour busses as the view points are quite small and no Parks Personnel to assist with crowd control or information. It is a thing you enjoy more with the quiet and serenity of the moment. No facilities.\"We drove out New Year's Day to take the short hike and view the falls in the winter. The water that was running was a beautiful blue and the ice formation on the falls was fantastic. Great for a short hike in the fresh air.\"I've been to the falls a number of times in the summer, and have enjoyed them every time.

Right by highway but allow 45-60 minutes to walk up, down, all around and really enjoy it.\"It's a bit off the beaten path. But so worth finding! It's great for old and young. Educational and picture worthy.These falls along with Sunwapta are both worthy of your time whilst touring the Icefield parkway road. In our opinion these falls just edge Sunwapta waterfalls.The erosion is more apparent and is easier to access with the walk from the car park being far from strenuous this should suit folk of most ages.Enjoy the power of water from a safe viewing platformWorth a stop to stretch your legs and witness the awesome beauty and power of nature. There are two platforms from which to see the waterfall..We like to walk along the paths and see the river and the falls. So peaceful and beautiful.

Follow the trails from the parking lot south to the viewing areas beside the falls It is possible to get interesting photos of the falls and the Athabasca River\"We visited twice, once in drizzle on the way up to Jasper and then, on the way back to Banff, in much better weather.

Well worth a visit\"\"Natural Beauty at it's best. Spectacular views and if in the area, you have to make time to stop here. Accessible to all and a short walk from the parking lot.Please make sure to stay within the allowed walkways. Accidents can happen if not\"\"The drive in was nice and clean. The falls was beginning to freeze but still falling. The only downside is where the walk goes down to the river on the left, seems to be used as a public bathroom. Still one of natures most beautiful sights.\"One of the many must see attractions in the area .It can get quite busy when 2 or 3 tourist buses turn up together .Be careful when it rains as it can get slippy underfoot.The etched canyon walls are quite impressive as is the startling blue of the water as it rushes through. Very photogenic so take your camera\"Me and my family (wife and 1 year old) stopped here back in mid August (took awhile to get to my review lol) but this place is definitely worth a stop.. It doesn't take long to see, but there is quite a few flights of stairs which made a bit of a hassle for our stroller and can get pretty busy, best to go in the morning or evening.. But other than that it was well worth it, the roar of the falls sure is something to hear..

Impressive as always but you could expect a lot of people.the falls are awesome they are a must see when you are in the area they are very inspiring and the lake below is greatThese falls must be included in any tour of the area. They are absolutely beautiful! There is a path that runs down from the car park and along by the river crossing it by the actual falls. Don't forget the camera!\"What ever the season, every time we are in Jasper we drive out to see the falls. Never get tired of watching and listening to them.. Different site every season.\"This is a beautiful waterfall on the Athabasca River; Breathtakingly beautiful. We're from the south U.S and just don't have this kind of water. It is worth the trip to Alberta. We always thought Alaska was the most beautiful place we have visited until we travel the Canadian Rockies.\"This is a great place to get off the highway for a bit an explore. The falls are awesome. There are so many different vantage points from which to view them, it is really cool set-up to wander around.

The amount of water coming down the falls was amazing and mind-boggling The force of the water has cut the rock like a razor.

A couple of hours well spent.A short walk from the parking lot and so worth itAmazing to see the water carved out through the rocksVisited during May ling weekend and it was cold so bring a jacket for sure (there was still some snow banks along the side of the road)\"Great place to stop and stretch the legs. While it isn't Niagara falls, it is an interesting geological feature on the road between Banff and Jasper. Informational plaques tell you how it was formed and why the colour of the water is what it is.\"We did a quick stop here on the way back from the sky walk. Easily could have walked for more than a quick 30 minutes. Seems as though there was more to see. But a great picture taking opportunity - and it's free. Worth the stop!\"Gorgeous falls.

Does get a bit chilly and slippery due to spray from the water so make sure to have a good coat and shoes with good grip.\"\"Very easy to access and view.

Car parking excellent. Pity about all the people taking 'selfies' - they probably missed out on the superb scenery!\"\"My friends and I recently made a road trip along the Canadian Rockies. We love hiking and this falls along with other lakes and other natural wonders, was part of our itinerary.

One of the best waterfalls we stopped at during our drive on the Columbia Parkway. This one is worth the stop and the walk.\"Great photo opportunity. Lovely waterfall, fast moving water.

Just take a look!\"We were on a tour, and this was one of the stops along the way from Banff to Jasper.Athabasca Falls a very powerful waterfall, due to the large quantity of water falling into the gorge. What was most interesting was that the force was so strong that it basically produced a diamond-like drill on the rocks. We were a bit surprised that it was still this strong, even though it's mid-September (we've had drought for 10 years in Los Angeles area, and even some falls are fairly dry by this time of the year).Photos, hopefully in order, show the gradual increase of water and the buildup.\"\"This is a spectacular stop, not to be missed.

Loved it!\"\"Monolithic rock formations have obviously been carved by eons of water cascading over them, eddies swirling glacial minerals against them like sculptors’ tools. Spectacular views from a bridge crossing the river made me long for the opportunity to hike the trail that lead to the bottom, where kayakers gather to shoot the rapids. There are several viewpoints around the falls, all of them phenomenal. This is a must-see for anyone driving along Icefields Parkway.

Its easily accessible and good for people all ages. The paved trails are well done and organized; great place for picnic or to spend a day.\"I visited this falls in September on tour. This is most beautiful place I have visited Easy to reach .the fall is so beautiful and very calming place to just seat and admire scenery The river plunges through a narrow gorge .Would highly recommend. Go early and enjoy place when less crowded.Allow plenty of time to take in this superb place.Worth a look. Not known for the height of the falls but experience the power and thunder of the falls up close from one of the viewing spots.Great scenery. The falls are amazing and the information boards are very good also. Great photo opportunities here.Great place to do whitewater rafting.Marilyn Monroe did a movie here. They built the road we take down to the river for her movie.Short walk from the car park. Easy to get too. Even in the middle of a drought the falls were spectacular. Worth the trip if you are in the area.A short way off the highway and well worth the visit.The river plunges through a narrow George creating spectacular eddy carvings in the rock walls.The access to view the falls is well planned and allows for excellent photo opportunities.Take care because the spray can get on your lenses and the footpath is wet and slippery in places.Overall a fine spectacle.The falls are well worth going in to check out. Lots of free parking and paved trails leading to several lookout points.\"Great day - seen some very picturesque countryside and did not have to do the driving, parking the car etc. I used both Banff and Jasper as my places of stay for a week while exploring all the surrounding country and sights. There is a much larger choice of good accommodation and places to eat in Banff than in Jasper as it is a much larger town.The day trip included Johnson's Canyon, Lakes Liouse and Moraine (very beautiful), and then up to the railway spiral tunnels and on to the Athabasca Falls. The best lake trip to do from Jasper is to Lake Maligne via the Maligne Canyon. This includes a cruise to the other end of the lake where you can get off and take great photos of the famous scenery encompassing Spirit Island, the lake, and the surrounding mountains. You see it in nearly every scene calendar of the Canadian Rockies. But you have to see it for yourself to take in the real beauty of that part of our planet.For the person who doesn't mind a bit of exercise, take the Jasper Tramway to the top of Whistler Mountain and then hike to the top. You will need good boots and a warm jacket as there is always a bit of snow up there. The views from the top are most rewarding.\"My wife and I were in Jasper National Park in August of 2015 and we were fortunate to see Athabaska Falls before the smoke came into the park from Eastern Washington. We thoroughly enjoyed the view and the trail to the falls. The entire Icefield's Parkway was beautiful and this was a nice place to stop and get out and take a nice walk to the Falls. Stopping is well worth the time!Bruce and Janet B.Impressive waterfalls which are easily accessible. We took the path that runs alongside the falls and returned on the upper path. Wonderful scenery!!!\"Powerful and dramatic falls really loud water at times. Not a huge place to walk around, its all free too.\"We went from Jasper and did not know what to expect ....but wow oh wow is all I can say ! You get a surprise when you get to the bridge to actually get a glimpse of what is in store...an amazing sight...do walk over the bridge and see the canyon and the flow of water ...coming from The Columbia Icefields which we were to visit the following day.We really loved it. An amazing sight.Beautiful place...the falls are magnificent as they plunge down the canyon. Be sure to visit this beautiful place.Like many people I have visited many sets of waterfalls in many far flung lands over the years. These however are special - you get up close and the glacier 'flour' makes the water a beautiful blue. Well worth a visit.\"Although we saw a lot of deep river canyons, with gorges and whirl pools, this was still worth visiting and had its own attractions. We all enjoyed our trip there and again wondered at what water under pressure can do\"Well worth the hour it will take to walk around the falls. Easy stop with good parking and no climbing or chamber in.Excellent stop and worth the visit. Spectacular falls with breattaking Rockies backdrop.Dull when we called in the morning but sunlit in the evening on our return which showed it and its backdrop in all their glory.\"Driving to Lake Louise from Jasper, a stop at Athabasca Falls is well worth it. Only draw back was the large number of large tour buses. The falls are amazing and beautiful, when all of the \"\"selfie\"\" takers finish and leave. It is recommended that paths and trails are adhered to. Not a place for solace.\"\"When you step out of the car, you can tell why this is a popular tourist stop along the Icefields Highway. You can hear the thunder of the falls, but also take in the very tangible surroundings - the trees, the plant life, even the birds and other animals that make the area their home. I visited in late September 2015 and lucked out by having beautiful sunny weather. Still, there was ice on the bridge overlooking the falls, so be careful and be aware. But for picture takers, this place will not disappoint. When you look up, you will be inspired by the mountains in the backdrop. The water was a turquoise and obviously quite cold. The bathrooms were \"\"national park\"\" style and could have been much cleaner, but that is a comment on some of the people who use them - makes one wonder. A worthwhile stop along your route and it's not too far from Jasper.\"\"Wow, incredible power. We rafted the Athabasca earlier and then went and saw the falls which really makes you appreciate this river and the fact that we got off it when we did with the guide.\"\"Very powerful waterfall and a great spot to stop when driving from Banff to Jasper, or the other way around. There’s an easy walking trail that leads to the falls. As with all the other beautiful sights that are easy accessible, there are lots of tourists.\"\"This waterfall, and the drive through Jasper national park are awe inspiring. You can get beautiful pictures at the falls. It is a quick and easy stop.\"This was an easy walk down to the falls.It's a bit more strenuous if you walk down the canyon to the river below. There are a few signs with info to read and all walkways are paved. A sight not to be missed in the Jasper area!I've attached a photo of our son at the bottom of the canyon walk dipping his toe in the Athabasca river.Athabasca Falls were superb! Got some really nice pictures. We prefer touristy destinations compared to secluded places and this had a good number of tourists. Thoroughly enjoyed it. Had washrooms and big parking lot.A nice place to visit and see the immense power of the falls. We walked around the boardwalks and had a break from the drive back from Jasper.\"A beautiful spot, worth the stop. Walk further down so you can take pictures from a different angle.\"\"Great stop on the way to Banff from Jasper! Easy walking trail, perfect for taking your old fragile parents to stretch their knees out!\"So pretty and we'll worth a stop here even if for a short while if your just passing by on your way to or from JasperHeading south along the Icefield Highway this is a left turn and not that well marked. Once back to the parking lot you can see that this is a major stop with lots of car and bus parking. Plan on spending about a half hour walking around and over the bridge to see to get a better view of the falls. Take the time to read the various signs and be patient with the many tourists all trying to get photos.Just off the main road - 1 minute off. Worth the stop it very pretty. Water super blue like in the photo.A short walk takes you to these amazing falls well worth the stop. It was -3 when we visited so wrap up also slippy under foot.\"This is a fantastic spot, simply a must see. We went and it was a damp rainy day. It wasnt a bad walk in the rain. It was simply stunning.\"A beautiful falls set amongst many beautiful spots on the Jasper to Banff drive. Easy walking and many beautiful opportunities for photos. I was fortunate to visit on a sunny day.It takes a couple of hours to look around everything there is to see. Its possible to get quite close to the falls and the power of the water is breathtaking.\"Beautiful falls and great scenery all around. Easy walk, but can get crowded at times. Allow plenty of time to just take in all the scenery.\"\"Really interesting falls, Even though we stopped by in September, there was a huge amount of water roaring down the falls. Well worth a stop.\"Nice place to while away an hour or two. Nice photographic opportunities. On the tourist bus run so be prepared for crowds. Launching spot for the river canoe trips.Its close to the main road and not far to go and it realy is amazing. And you can do it even when the weather is not so favorable.\"Nice waterfalls, on a short distamce of Jasper. Bit crowded, but nice little easy walk around and worth visiting.\"You can take the short walk down to the falls and stand on the viewing areas and see the immense amount of water churning and falling over the falls. It's stunning. You can also follow the trail and see the water and beautiful forest further down - it's very nice.Beautifull scenery and great walking path to falls. Another of natures wonders to see along the way through Jasper parkwayWell worth the trip. It is an easy walk. Parking is a problem after 1000 am. Many nice photo ops. I highly recommend a visit.It's just on the roadside so imagine how popular it can be - compared to those spots way off the 93 pkwy. It has good spots to take stunning photos but get prepared for the crowds especially when tour buses come. It's not a huge fall but definitely worth a stop.\"Such a lovely place to visit the falls are lovely and we enjoyed walking around the park with our guide we arranged a tour with Sundog Tours it was fabulous the guide walked us through and told us the history of the area highly recommend a tour to these falls, we took some great photo's.\"\"Great place to visit, it has some great views and places to walk. If you like to take pictures this is one of the best landmarks you can find.\"\"These falls are well worth stopping to see and are just a short walk from the parking lot. Another popular spot along the Icefields Parkway so can get quite busy. There is a nice pathway that is a easy hike and gives you a number of different views of the both the falls and the mountains behind them. Although they are not the highest falls, there is a vast amount of water shooting through the gorge which is very impressive. Despite what a previous reviewer stated, there are bathroom facilities near the parking lot.\"\"Worth a stop for this moderate, but interesting waterfall south of Jasper. Parks Canada has excellent interpretive signage and paths. Short walk from the parking area on paved paths.\"\"Wonderful groomed trails,I always go back, the views are spectacular! many choices of trails to take I love the rock stairs between the wall of rocks\"stunning scenery the falls are fabulous and not too long a walk off the road to see them. No place to have a drink or toilet on site\"Beautiful site with a nice cozy restaurant in the vicinity on the highway. The Falls are so unique and beautiful. Worth a visit, lots of parking and nice walk in the area.\"\"We stopped here because we were staying in a nearby campsite. At first glance, I thought it might just be a boring little touristy stop. But there are actually several different pathways to explore. My 4 year son loved it. Make sure you stay on the path, and take warnings seriously. One slip into the river, and you will not come back!! We would come here again forsure, our next trip to jasper.\"\"The falls made a good stop on the Icefields Parkway; it is just about the northernmost point of interest on the parkway and is close to Jasper townsite. We were there in September, but I expect that people who visit in the spring and early summer would be much more impressed because the water flow would be higher.\"\"Stunning display of the power of water. The falls are well worth a visit. This is a very managed site, with paved paths, guard rails and lots of other visitors.\"\"Easy access to this great natural nature valley. Beautiful place to see. Took lots of pictures, very peaceful.\"A lovely set of cascading falls...one of our favorite stops on a long day of park and attraction visits.\"Wonderful attraction, beautiful falls and surrounding scenery. The falls run into lovely blue/ turquoise water dependent upon the amount of sunshine and rock flour in the water\"They're soo beautiful but very touristic. It's just to stop by and enjoy the falls for an hour or so. You can sit down and just enjoy the scenery. Wonderful!We nearly drove past this turning at the end of a long day on the road which had included many stops to see lots of other spectacular sights. Definitely glad we made changed our mind and made the trip to see these falls. They were awesome.We stopped here on our way to Jasper and so glad we did. The Falls were fabulous and we stayed a while just staring at the moving water.\"Went here on a rainy day but the place was packed. There were school groups and bus loads of people. The falls were very interesting and worth the trip. Of note, was the way the falls cascaded through the cliffs, making a very interesting site. Again, going through the rain probably dampened the effect but is well worth the trip.\"A stunning display of nature's forces at their best. Probably best to visit early in the day or later in the day as it does get busy! Although their are restrooms at the site there are no other facilities so take a picnic and a beverage.\"So beautiful and defiantly with a stop as driving by! Just a minute or so off the hi-way and 200 meters walk from the parking. You will get to see some beauty that will take your breath away! As Nike says \"\"just do it\"\"\"A must visit when visiting jasper!enjoyed every minute of the hike.its a one way hike so plan accordingly.the hiking trail is moderately steep but made easy because of the stairs which might get slippery in rain.lots of small springs also on the way between the 5th and 6th bridge very interesting!\"The falls are a must see in the area, they are spectacular and fairly easily accessible although there are a lot of stairs down to the lower area.\"\"The glacial rivers and lakes are absolutely stunning in both Jasper and Banff Parks, with each one just bit different than another. This one has rushing water and is wider than Maligne Canyon.\"I like waterfalls and this one is loud and amazing to experience I was on a bus tour so very little time to explore But if an independent traveller take your time to appreciate this wonder of nature\"The Athabasca Falls are just a short stroll from the parking lot and very easy to reach. The falls are very beautiful, but I found that the concrete paths and railings took away from the experience, although I understand that these are safety measures.\"Good parking Easy walk through trees to the falls. Several great views of the falls from the well defined pathway. The boiling waters of the river plunge into a chasm gouged out of the valley floor. Quite spectacular. Amazing watching the power of the water and looking at the various colours and patterns in the layers of rock as we walked down a path cut through the rock to a lower vantage point. The various rock formations created by the water are really interesting and quite incredible. Great opportunity for some fantastic photos here.Well worth a stop.\"Worth seeing if you are visiting Jasper. Amazing view, fantastic spot to take pictures. It can get crowded during peak season but there's plenty of space to walk around\"Pathways are well thought out and allow visitors to see the falls from all angles. 30 minutes is plenty of time to see everything. Well worth a stop\"Well worth the drive. Only 30 km outside of Jasper, definitely will not regret it. Stay on the paths!!!\"The falls are easy to see and a short walk from the parking lot. Canada parks have latrine style toilets so beware.A great place to get close to waterfalls and experience the rush and thrill of the power of nature. Easy access from highway. Very popular place for tourists to go toGreat views of how water can erode rock in beautiful curves. The water is a wonderful color and the rock formations interesting. You can easily hike along the river and see great views.A beautiful setting with the Athabaska River flowing into magnificent falls. Numerous trails twisted and turned throughout the area\"Amazing!! A must see. Great walking trails. The weather was great - a little cold, need to dress warmly. Excellent amenities.\"\"These falls have to be seen if you go to Jasper.It was one of the highlights of our trip.Magnificent place to take photos.Please go and enjoy them\"beautiful and breathtaking view of Athabasca falls. Love it and will definitely going back to Jasper just to see this awesome place.\"wonderful for pictures or videos, make sure you record some sound to go with your videos. The roar of the falls can be heard before you leave the parking lot.\"This is one of the highlights of Jasper Park. The Falls are a very easy walk from the parking lot. The paths are set up to get great views of the falls from several angles.The falls were some distance outside Jasper but well worth a visit. The surrounding mountains were very majestic as was the Falls themselves. The noise and the water volume were stunning.\"This place does get crowded so I would suggest going early in the day, plenty to look out, pretty amazing geology. Walk down to the little beach its beautiful!\"\"just off the highway and a short easy walk to the falls which has a concrete bridge overlooking them, there is a pathway which will take you further down the waterfall to its base in the lake, its amazing to see how the water over the years has cut through the layers of rock leaving a very scenic walkway\"Great falls. A bridge allows you to walk over to the other side and admire the falls from both sides. We really enjoyed walking through the dried up canyon.Beautiful area need to spend sometime here not rush it. You can take some great photos. Different options available depending on ability to access areas.\"Photographs are my goal and these falls are dynamic. Power, colour and surroundings are so beautiful. Trails can be a little slippery as it is misty so walk carefully. They are close to the parking lot and there are some really nice trails all around.\"\"Visited as part of a tour, great sight to see and good photo opportunity and, although lovely to look at, wouldn't have visited unless it was part of the tour.\"\"Athabasca falls is on the Icefields parkway, only 20 miles outside of Jasper. The parking lot is right along the parkway and a very short walk will take you to the falls. The power of the falls is so unexpectedly strong. Follow the easy trail along the canyon, and it’s hard to believe how calm Athabasca River is while it was just thundering through a very short distance up the canyon. It is well worth a stop.\"\"We did a white water rafting trip with Jasper Rafting down the Athabasca River and loved the scenery. Very cold day but wet suits keep you warmish.Our guide was very informative and fun.\"this was a fabulous part of our trip to Jasper- beautiful waterfall and lovely canyon pathways. Would recommend to anyone visiting the area.\"This can get busy, but it is well worth a visit, suggest later in the day as its not far form Jasper along the Ice Fields Parkway\"\"Been here twice, and both times the sights and sounds have blown us away. Easy to walk around, comfortably accessible from the parking area.\"The access to such amazing falls is surprisingly easy! It's well worth a stop if you are traveling south from Jasper. There are picnic tables near the parking lot if you want to enjoy your lunch but they may be full as it's a popular stop.very busy location but when you get close to the falls its amazing. there are nice areas to get some good shots and places to read about the history\"Stopped by pretty much by chance, and when we got out of the car, was sure it wasn't worth the time. Boy were we wrong. Wound up spending 2 hours admiring the power and awesomeness of nature, particularly the velocity of water. Well worth the trip!!\"This is a must-see if you're visiting Jasper National Park. At certain times of the year (early spring and summer) the falls are at their peak and very inspiring to see. There is a cute little restaurant at the entrance of the road leading to the falls that is a great place to stop for lunch or a snack.Beautiful falls in a beautiful setting. Easy access. Great way to see the beauty and power of nature.\"So glad we stopped off to see this - it was much more that we expected - stunning! You can see a certain amount with just a short easy walk, or venture further over more rocky paths for more amazing views.\"Great hiking in the area. Lots of trails and beautiful scenery. It was cold so wear lots of layers. Wonderful place for plenty of Kodak moments.\"Athabasca Falls is beautiful. Even considering the crowd of people, I'd advise anyone to stop during their exploration of the Icefields Parkway. Don't just stop at the first viewpoint; take time to walk the area and appreciate all of the viewpoints. Because of the large number of tourists, we did not linger -- only spent about 30 minutes.\"\"I've been here numerous times over the years and throughout the different seasons, things have changed over the years and it's more fenced in for safety these days. Yes, there are fools that climb over the railing and put no only themselves in danger but those who would have to rescue them. The view of the falls is beautiful and one could easily spend hours just sitting there taking in the view and sound of the falls. However, the spot gets very crowded at times and some folks aren't polite and basically push their way in front of you to get a photo. Really not necessary as some of us (myself) would be willing to take the group photo for them if only good manners would shown.It's certainly a spot I'll return...just hoping the next time it will be less busy. You can easily bring your kids with you - just ensure you hold their hand as it can get a little slippery in some spots.\"an easy place to visit with few steep hikes! you can chose to walk more or less and the paved pathways will give you a good view.Enjoyed taking time here but lots of people around - easy access for coaches. May need to fight for photo spots. Many viewing points. Do the walk down the old river route (there are a few steps) which takes you to different views of the canyon and the river - crowds thin out here and you can sit on rocks by the water. Unfortunately steps mean difficult for wheelchair access to most of the site.\"It's a beautiful, natural attraction - which is still free of charge! I highly recommend stopping and taking time to explore the falls and the canyon while you are passing through the area.\"\"I have visited the Athabasca Falls three times during the last 4 years and in three different seasons. It has been accessible in April and October – for sure in July as well. And it has been worth seeing it in all seasons.In April it was frozen, in October it had the most amount of water and it was for sure and by far the most crowded in July. Incredible! Be sure to go there early in the morning when you want to take some pictures without a bunch of idiotic tourists who climb over fences to get the most amazing picture using the longest selfie-stick you have ever seen. If you go there to be entertained, go there around noon during peak season. I promise you, you will be amazed how stupid the majority of the Brewster bus tourists are… I can still barely believe what I saw.Other than that: One of the iconic spots in the Canadian Rockie´s Nationalparks and a must see.\"\"Absolutely will go back there- so amazing and so beautiful !!Short walk from the parking lot and different levels to view from. Something different to see with each viewing area.\"Beautiful. Only a Short walk from the car park. Even when it's crowded the spectacle is still worth it.This stop is definitely worthwhile. The view of the raging falls are amazing and great pictures to be taken.\"Always beautifulSpring and fall clean and blue watersummer strong and white water fall with rainboweasy to accessssuggest go there 2 hours before the sunset for the best result\"Absolutely beautiful waterfall - and there are lots to see!! Very peaceful with stunning views all around.We've been here many times but it's always great to see again. We went down to bottom and just sat and relaxed for a while too.The falls is an easy walk from the parking lot. Parcs Canada has built platforms from which you can get great views of the turquoise-colored water plunging over rocks. Don't miss this!\"We came here because of all of the already great reviews and it we were not disappointed. About 30 mins out of the Jasper - it wasn't too congested and the sights were amazing. (Great to grab a few photos for your instagram followers)The waterfall is something you can just stand there and take in for some time - the sound and overall power of the falls is captivating. Not far down on a trail is the lower area where the water eventually comes down to a clearing. Here you can grab some more pretty pictures & pose with the crystal clear waters.Free, beautiful, natural; what more could you want?\"Beautiful waterfalls and canyon. Get there early so you don't have to deal with all the tour buses and tourists. Take time to do the short hike to enjoy the falls.Lovely view and there is a nice hour walk along the edges of the falls. The water is nice and blue and in the sun is beautiful. Well worth a visit\"The crowds couldn't ruin the beauty of this place, though by the state of the public toilets you're almost convinced that they're actually trying to...GROSS but not the Falls fault, so not incorporating that experience into my review. Allow some time to walk to the bottom of the canyon to where the river widens out and avoid the first view point at the top especially during visits during peak periods of summer and long weekends, unless you're nostalgic for a mosh pit full of tourists. all trying to take the same picture (now I miss the Mona Lisa)...\"A must stop!!! Walk around a bit - ignore all the crowds - it's still beautiful! It's an easy walk almost all can handle it.\"Beautiful, powerful, amazing waterfall. When you are standing at the falls with the mountain looming over you and the power of the falls crashing down, it makes you feel something I cannot describe.\"\"Well worth the stop! the falls are only a short walk from where you park your car. I was early, and the only one there.\"This place is not to be missed. Totally breathtaking. Well worth taking a trip back to visit if you are driving to Jasper from Banff and are sceniced out from the Icefield Parkway.\"Really beautiful falls, what it doesn't have in height it makes up for in power. Great viewing spots, easily accessible for all the family. Nice walking trail leading from main falls to the lower river\"As with anything in Jasper the overcrowding took away from the beauty of the falls. You need to get here early but that's what they say for all the attractions so you have to do some in the afternoon.\"These falls are utterly spectacular, and awesome force of nature within a few minutes walk of the car park, unmissable.\"\"These falls, while not as large as some of the others, are very impressive due to their sheer power. It was an enjoyable place to stop for half an hour.\"Lovely falls we visited on the drive to jasper. Free parking once you get into the park. The falls are just a little walk from the car park. Well worth a stop off.\"At the time of our visit, this was rated No 1 in the area on Trip Advisor. It's a decent sized waterfall, but nothing special. Worth a 30 minute stop, and it's free. If you're travelling south on the Icelands Parkway, the falls at Tangle Creek are less powerful but arguably more beautiful.\"This is an easy stop off of the Icefield Parkway and a great place for photos. The falls are gorgeous with the mountains in the background. The potholes were fascinating also.Go early before the crowds come especially the coaches. The atmosphere is better and you can take pictures.I love waterfalls and this was one of the most powerful waterfalls I have ever seen. I loved it a lot.We spent a morning at and around the falls. The river below the falls are used by rafters and its fun to watch them start their 'ride'. It's amazing to see how the water has created shapes and potholes in the rock. Take time to walk along the riverside above the main falls - it is so peaceful\"Great for some photos and you can walk over to a bridge the other side to see it properly.Only issue I had was the paths were uneven on the viewing areas so I struggle as have mobility issues.\"\"The Athabaska falls are easy to access on the Icefield parkway. The falls are impressive by the roar and how powerful it looks! It is worth the drive, loved everything in the majestic Rocky Mountains!\"A nice easy short walk to view the falls and the gorgeous colour of the water is fantastic. The depth of the gorge is amazingWalk along the river and see how the water has eroded the rock over time. A fairly busy but attractive tourist stop. You can even visit in winter! A nice spot to stretch your legs to the sound of running water.\"This is one of the many attractions on the Icefields Parkway. The waterfalls are big and powerful and right off the parkway, so it is easy to get to. On the downside, it gets VERY crowded, so get there early or late in the day.\"\"Amazing roars of water just about 20 minutes from Jasper.There, the falls carves a deep canyon.The misty water will cool you down in the summer.\"\"We stopped off at the falls on our way from Jasper to Banff and it was worth the stop. Beautiful falls and very nicely set up with lookout points on either side of the river. It was a bit crowded mid-afternoon so if you are looking for a peaceful visit, you may want to pick a time that is a bit less busy. Even finding somewhere to park is difficult at mid-day.\"\"Breathtaking, awesome, spectacular definitely worth a visit. The power of the water amazingJust about 10 mins from jasper, good parking, toilet facilities.\"Spectacular falls a short drive from Jasper. There is a great walk that is perfect for kids of all ages. The walk does involve a lot of stairs so may not be great for disabled people. The falls are very dramatic and the surrounding mountains are spectacular. Allow about 45 minutes to fully experience this natural wonder. It does get very busy so try and get there early or go late afternoon when it's a bit quieter.This stop was one of the highlights of our trip in the Banff/Jasper region. What a beautiful spot with many lookouts to catch and feel the full power of the river. Highly recommend!Beautiful waterfall and scenery just outside of the town of Jasper. Does not take long to visit and had an easy paved walking trail the entire way!Make sure you stop to see these falls. The power of the water rushing through the rocks is amazing. It's an easy walk to see the different views.\"One of the 'must visit' places on a visit up or down the Icefields Parkway, this is a quite spectacular waterfall. Best seen on a beautiful day. Parking difficult to find here on a busy summer day and lots of people to jostle with but worth the effort.\"This was a great place to visit (especially with kids). Some of the parts on the paths are not so stroller friendly but others are. We had a great time and got some cute pictures. But the places is pretty popular so it could be crowded.\"If you are in and around Jasper nd want a photo op with a good waterfall in the foreground and a great mountain backdrop, then this is the place for you :) It is not extra special in this area of jaw-dropping beauty but convenient location and ease of access will really cost you no extra time.\"\"Wonderful views of the falls and great touristy attraction. If you want a quieter experience, go early in the morning and enter the area from the highway so you don't get roped into the \"\"do not cross\"\" propaganda. Rocks are slippery but the view is worth it.\"Nice attraction to visit with the family (teen and 9 year old).There were informative plaques for ones who wanted to learn more about geology and how impactful the falls were to carving the landscape we see now.Nice view at the bottom of the river.This is a short detour on the way to Jasper... well worth it. The trail leads to a very close encounter with the power of nature as it winds close to rushing water.\"Amazing nature, great escape from the routine life, very much recommended. Be ready to walk & hike a lot!\"\"Beautiful place, short hike going to the bridge where you can have nice view of the falls. Definitely a must-see place when visiting Jasper.\"\"Our first time to the Falls. It was amazing.If you are travelling the Jasper way, stop here and take it all in as it is truly a wonder to see. It does not take long, the crowds are not onerous and it is a wonderful way to get out and stretch your road legs.Listen and read the signs about staying within the rail boundaries. It was disheartening to read the stories of the 2-young men memorialized on benches after losing their lives trying to get an up-close look at the Falls. Hard to believe anyone would risk life and limb trying to get a better look at the massive amount of glacial cold water roiling down the rocks and no one survives a fall into the chasms.\"What a beautiful area! This is a short walk from the parking lot area and is jaw-dropping! Must see when on your way to Jasper!!Access via the park trail is nice and personal. Views along the way are quite memorable. Definitely worth a stop. Could easily spend an afternoon admiring the sights and sounds.The power of mother nature and water is absolutely amazing! These falls are probably the most accessible of all in this area - a level short walk from the car park!Great spectacle to see all this water so powerful. Good stop not to be missed. Great photo opportunity\"A 5 to 7 minute hike through the woods brings you to this roaring falls. While this is not comparable to the Niagra, but it is a cute little fall that gives you a lot of photo opportunities.\"It's a must see. The water is an amazing colour. So pretty. Easy to get to. We were travelling with older ones and they found the walk fine.\"Very worth going, short nice hike to spectacular views. Bring sweater or jacket, as it may still get cold.\"\"Absolutely beautiful. The water fall was so powerful, the scenery was epic. Grab a picnic basket and a few bevies. I could have spent the whole day here.\"Amazing view and well worth the trip to visit the Athabasca Falls.

The force of the water being funnelled through a small canyon was incredible.\"\"I have seen many falls, they are usually far away from roads and you have to hike to see them, sometimes you have hike a day and stay a night in tent to see them, like Della Fall in Vancouver Island.

Do not skip this stop.These falls differ than Sunwapta (a few Km's away). The raw crushing power of this fall is astonishing. The Sunwapta Falls are beautiful in their own 4-step beauty.

We liked the clefts in the rock (nice and cool), and the different view points. Good hiking in the area.\"\"Worth a quick stop. Close to road. Has some good informational markers to read. Falls are pretty. Different water colors at different times of year is cool, and I like how the markers tell you about why it's colored that way.\"\"We went in November when it was pretty chilly, but the views were amazing and the falls were so powerful. The crystal blue water was so cold and it was just breathtaking! It is slippery walking on the rocks, so be cautious. We will defiantly come back to see the views in the summer time.\"Travelling the ice fields parkway we stopped here to look at the falls. Easy walking and paths with great views.\"Free with your Parks Canada admission. This is surely not to miss.

Still, as a person who enjoys nature, walking on the trails is always a good idea.Outside, the toilets are located in two separate areas. Just thought you'd like to know.\"Beautiful for a picnic or a short walk. White water rafting available below the falls.

We went early in the morning so we beat most of the tour buses.\"These powerful falls really do make you appreciate the power of nature.Easy to negotiate pathways etc that give wonderful close up views.You would struggle to spend more than 2 hours here but it is worth it.If coming from Jasper take the older highway 93A as you are more likely to see wildlife along here.We stopped here on our way down the Icefields Parkway.

An easy stop and walk along the hwy, it is a must see.\"We drove from Banff to Jasper and this was our last stop for the day. It's not far out of the way and the falls are only a very short (5 minute max) walk from the carpark. There's a great view of the falls from the bridge and some nice photo opportunities.\"Natural beauty at its best. An easy walk and a great experience of what power water can have. Sometimes the rocks win, but rarely. This is a good example of the power of water. Enjoy.\"It is worth stopping and seeing the falls. We stopped early in the morning and it wasn't that busy. There is not a lot of room in some of the viewing areas.\"This waterfall is amazing, so even if the parking lot is jammed, stop, wait for a space, and see this area. Be sure to walk all around as the view changes from different angles. And hey, you waited your turn for this!\"A rainy day made for a perfect stop at these falls because nobody else was there.

Though these aren't super high falls they are very impressive and beautiful. A nice trail goes around them offering different view points.\"Do not drive past these falls. The walk to reach them is minimal from the carpark. We have nothing like this in our country of rivers and waterfalls (New Zealand).

We saw them in August and were impressed with the amount of rushing water; one can only imagine this in the spring run off! The path offers many viewing sights of the top and bottom of the falls and the amazing rock canyon that has been carved by the strength of the rushing water. This site is very easily accessible and does not require a long hike. You can fit this attraction in your day very easily.\"This is a nice stop on the way to or from Jasper. For a short height, the water has a strong current, so it is nice to see this and feel the mist. It doesn't take a lot of time to visit, but you could have a picnic lunch there, too and stay awhile. Definitely worth the stop!\"I absolutely love these falls :) this is one of 3 or 4 falls you can find along the glacier parkway road and this one doesn't disappoint at all!

Make sure to see from all vantage points.I've been here twice in 11 years and both times found the amount of people caused it to be quite crowded as it is a most popular attraction. We spent less than 20 minutes and were able to capture some photos and be in our way to more natural settings that are less crowded.\"A very nice waterfall that is close to the highway and is thus very accessible. Tends to be a little crowded but nothing like the crowds you'll see in Banff/Lake Louise. If you're in the area, it's definitely worth checking out.\"\"Take your camera and spend some time taking pictures of the falls, work with the settings to experiment and capture all the unique views of the water.

It is impressive to see the Athabasca River flowing over the waterfall and through the narrow canyon. the bridges and trails afford better views than what one finds at many other locations.\"Natural park with lots of trails. Powerful waterfalls from all angles. Gorgeous scenery with space for all to enjoy the areaGreat supervision by parks Canada\"We stopped at the Athabasca Falls on our way to Jasper.There are trails all along the river and falls of which you should do the whole trail to get great views at all angles. There are outdoor bathroom facilities for your convenience. I would definitely stop there again if I have the opportunity to travel to Alberta again. What an awesome province.This is on the way to/from Jasper and is a must stop! Make sure you stay within the bounds but do walk down to the bottom and get some great shots looking up the canyon towards the falls!Take the time to walk the trails as there is so much to see at the various levels and viewing areas of this fall.I loved the scenery here!

Well worth a visit and not too crowded either, at least not when we were there!\"Beautiful thundering waterfall and quite accessible for travellers. Close to the highway and an absolute must see if you get anywhere near Jasper. The etching of stone from the falls and river is a remarkable view and appreciated by all ages.Roaring falls in a stunning setting. Saw the glaciers off in the distance. The overlook path allows visitors to see the falls up close.Nature's beauty shouldn't be overlooked . Good picnic spot and outdoor bathrooms available . Good walkways to see the falls from various angles.\"Worth the stop on the road trip! You see the falls, and can walk 59 steps to the lower part of the river to a beach, nice photo opps. Altogether it was a nice stop from the Columbia icefield to Jasper!\"This is beautiful and worth the hike. It's breathtaking. Take time to read the science behind why and how the falls were created. Path was wheelchair accessible.\"The beauty beyond words. Interesting and informative plaques. Great spot for pictures. We walked down to the canyon level steep and uneven, this level should only recommended for those fit enough to do that type of walk, I did not see signs listing difficulty levels.\"On the morning we visited these falls it was cold and raining and a bus load of other tourists had just arrived but ot still absolutely worth the stop.\"A great attraction, some great scenery.

Nature is a powerful force in action and these falls prove it. It's only a short and easy walk to the falls so no excuses if you are in the area! Be aware that there will likely be lots of people viewing at the same time. It's worth the additional small walk to the bottom of the falls to see the view across the valley. Enjoy!\"Awesome to witness and hear the force of nature. Makes me wish I had studied physical geography at school.\"Pretty but, seriously, just a waterfall. If you're from the pacific northwest or surrounding areas, you've seen better. Take the time to see Maligne Canyon... it was a lot more impressive and interesting.\"These falls were some of the best we saw on our trip - and we saw a few! Amazing to see how the force of the water has eroded and channeled the rock over the years. Truly awe inspiring to watch the power of the water.\"What a beautiful look out. Well worth the stop.

You can walk all the way down to the river as well. The kids loved it.Impressive bit of nature! It has a lot of people around but only because it is something you must see.

We went when it was still half frozen and it was incredible. The surroundings are amazing as well. Definitely recommend, plus its free!!\"We stopped by while driving to Jasper and must say that they are nice and it is just a 10 minutes walk to see them.\"The falls were very crowded in the summer, but it is worth a stop to take in the falls. If the crowds get to you, take a quick hike into the woods and you will be fine\"\"Based on the reviews, we picked this hike for our trip. Parked at fifth bridge and walked up to the upper parking lot and back. Along the way we were astounded by the beauty of waterfalls, canyon, water, rocks, and bridges. The hike has lots of up and down on uneven surfaces, so not recommended for those who have trouble walking. There is an easier and shorter loop from the upper parking lot though for those who need it. If you can though I highly recommend the longer loop. We returned via the horse trail which added aDifferent view.\"Pretty spot and worth a look. The falls are impressive and the canyon which has resulted from the power of the falls in very beautiful.Beautiful scenery. Wear good shoes so that you can go for a hike while you're there and not worry about slipping on wet rocks. Bring a camera! No cost other than entry fee into National Park.\"Stopped at the Athabasca Falls location for a lunch break. Very impressive falls and the power was impressive. Nice place to take a break, but the picnic tables were a long distance back from the falls area. Would be nice to move a table or two closer to the area to enjoy the view and natural sounds of the area.Viewing areas were varied and made for a nice walk and exploration.\"Easily accessed and good for a short visit. Steps are involved but there are handrails. It's worth walking the ten minutes to the furthest viewing point for the waterfall and if light is right you will see a rainbow\"When we were planning the Western leg of our family's Trans Canada Road Odyssey, one of the MUST SEES we had listed out was Athabasca Falls.And while returning from Jasper via Mt. Edith Cavell to Calgary, we stopped for quite some o admire this marvel of nature. Not only are the falls highly impressive but the surrounding rock formations in a variety of shapes and colours are just astonishing. We walked around the area, crossing a number of bridges to take in the sightsThe roaring water cascading over the rock and disappearing into a gorge and reappearing a little distance away was a magnificent sight and we took our time to savour its beauties.Earlier, we had descended from Mt. Edith Cavell, which is also something to put you in awe of nature. I climbed to the edge of the glacier to appreciate the floating icebergs in the lake at the foot of the mountain and the glacier which looked like a moose head, was unique. The greenish lake fed by the glacier was also an awe inspiring sight and after quite some attempts, we found a spot from where we could get Mt. Edith Cavell reflected in its still water, really a mind boggling sight!!!En route, we also took a detour to see Moab lake where we found the surrounding conifer forest lining the mountainside had been blackened during a forest fire some years ago. The lake itself was a hidden gem, its still blue- green water perfectly reflecting the hillsides around.This detour was indeed one of the most rewarding during our Rockies trip\"\"Easy to get to, but also many people, even from early morning. Great stop, and many Angela to take pictures from. Must see.\"\"Beautiful and exciting hike, when we went it was raining, so we have to be really careful walking. I believe it will be even nicer when the weather is promising.\"Definitely worth the stop! Lots of picture opportunities. Great parking even for large vehicles. Lots of people visiting but didn't feel too crowded.\"Very easy stop and we'll worth it (even if it were tough to get to, it would be worth it). Great stop with my parents, which cannot handle tougher hikes. One of the best stops in the park.\"\"Not a large fall, but you can get really up close. Good viewpoints - both of the Fall and the canyon; can also walk down to the river level. A nice getaway if you have 1-2 hours.\"\"Sure, it's pretty to see these falls. It is also a quick stop when heading down the road. Give yourself about 20 minutes to see all of this. A plus is that it is cooler here than inland=refreshing!\"Not too far from your car if you are not a big time hiker. The watr is amazing and the view is like a painting. In the winter the snow on the trees looks like a postcard and the bridges cross over the steep canyons below.\"These Falls were amazing. The sound and sight of the rushing water was amazing, and there was something new to see round every corner.\"\"I visited the Athabasca Falls in the early evening (say, around 6 PM?) and it was perfect. A lot of people were leaving the falls, probably to have dinner. The falls themselves are very powerful and mesmerizing to watch. I recommend visiting the falls 100%!\"\"These falls are some of the most beautiful views I've ever seen, with a (very) minimal amount of hiking. An absolute must see.\"Clean area fantastic viewing. The falls never let you down. Especially go to the far side where you all most stand over themThis was one of the places that we had planed to visit. It is a beautiful and wild place to visit. It was very busy as there were buses stopping as well. Well worth the time for sure. There are lots of information plaques to look at.\"Well worth your time to stop and enjoy this waterfall. The falls are only a very short walk from the parking lot, so this works if you have people in your party who can only walk short distances. There are viewpoints on both sides of the lake above the falls, on both sides at the falls, a bridge over the falls, and a viewpoint below the falls. All of them are enjoyable and give you opportunities for great photos.Athabasca Falls is just off Highway 93 (Icefields Parkway) on Highway 93A. There is lots of parking, but it can also be very busy midday. Coming in the morning or late afternoon will help you in the parking lot and with the crowds at the viewpoints.\"\"Not much to say here other than the fact that I appreciate that there were no large tour busses and loud people rushing around. In fact, although the area did see quite a bit of traffic, it didn't affect my experience. I found that the falls were very easy to get to...just a few minutes' walk from the parking lot AND you can take a staircase down to the river. It was fantastic to do a quick in-and-out !\"\"IF you are on a driving tour-- good for you! You just picked one of the best sites to visit. If you are on a bus tour you may regret not having enough time to see the Falls the deep pot-holes and water-carved rock formations. If you love rock \"\"out croppings\"\" this is the place for you. If you love the sound of rushing water, ditto also. I also highly recommend downloading the Gypsy app for your iPhone or android phone which for only a few bucks gives you the full history of the area.If going in the summer keep a small bottle of Avon SSS (Skin So Soft) handy to chase away the mosquitoes.\"\"The Athabasca Falls are a great place to stop and stretch your legs when travelling Hwy 93. The falls are located about 32 Km (give or take) south of Jasper. The walking trails are pretty good but make sure to keep everyone on the trails and eye on the kids (of all ages). Way to many people get carried away and end up in the soup. You will more then likely not survive the 23 meter fall.There is also a chance for wild life so be prepared accordingly.Good idea to bring a sweater or wind breaker, it cools off a fair amount in the shady parts of the trail. Bottle of water is in order.Parking is good, even for RV's. Washrooms available.\"These are well worth a visit and are quite spectacular with various different view points so you are best to spend the time moving from one to another to get different views of the falls and to led the crowds move on. Recommended and its free.\"Amazing! Always a must do on every trip to Jasper. So beautiful, don't miss it! Can get very busy during the day.\"\"We enjoyed our trip to these falls. The water comes from an attractive lake and is forced over the falls with a good deal of momentum. There's a reasonable amount of noise and a good deal of spray and some damp paths that can be a bit slippery. You can view the falls from a number of locations but, like many places, it can get crowded.\"This is an excellent point of interest along the Icefields Parkway. They have done an excellent job of giving multiple viewpoints for the falls and canyon. Well worth the stop. We spent about 45-60 minutes here.An easy pull off from the highway. Ample parking. Stunning view of the falls. Drawback...the usual long drop toilet.\"Really lovely place to visit - the falls are quite impressive with lots of spray and you can cross over and see them from both sides, which is nice. We didn't walk further down the creek as we were on a tour and only had a short amount of time.\"This is a very popular location so you would be wise to arrive early or very late. I'm talking theme park crowds. The falls area is truly spectacular with multiple viewpoints to view different parts of the falls from every possible angle. Some of the viewpoints are wheelchair accessible but others require negotiating many and sometimes narrow steps. The main viewpoints are fenced to minimize accidental falls into the frothing water. Entering the water anywhere close to the main falls would likely be catastrophic.\"So worth seeing, How can you go wrong when you can be surrounded by such beauty and majestic scenery!\"\"To find these falls, you drive south of Jasper and then take a narrow road for about 30 km. It isn't the best road, but the falls are truly amazing. The parking lot is huge. There are outhouses in the parking lot. The falls are a short walk from the parking lot. The sound of the rushing water is amazing. The falls themselves are something else. You can see them from several vantage points. There are 'potholes' that are holes that have been carved away by the constant whirling of the water. The layers of rock that have been carved away by the water is incredible. There are some stairs, but very few. The walk to see all vantage points could be done by most.\"Very easy to get to because it was right off the road. Very short hike and very impressive falls. It was worth seeing because it was so accessible.We loved this place. Even though it was busy it is possible to find your own space to appreciate the different views.There is no admission charge & you can easily spend an hour there. I would recommend going downstream as well as the upper levels. Here you can sit & watch in peace. Excellent\"Beautiful place to stop along the Icefield Parkway near Jasper National Park,easy trail to the falls. There are a few trails to choose depending on how long you want to hike.\"Worth the trip. Gets very busy so try and arrive early to get a parking space. Combine with icefileds trip.\"What a beautiful site to behold, the falls offer so much beauty at any time of the year, I recommend seeing it during all the changes in the season, walking the path around the falls to see what Mother Nature has created over thousands of years is a must, it's free, it's peaceful and you really will be in aw.\"\"More spectacular than many of the other falls/lakes alongside the Ice Field Parkway.Easily accessible and just beautiful on a sunny day!\"Beautiful falls. Easy access to them. They end in the thundering Maligne canyon which is a short distance awayThe glacier is melting away. The giant truck that carry the tourist on to the ice are great and being on the glacier is amazing.\"We all thoroughly enjoyed it (ages 11 to 61). The natural beauty and power on display was impressive and mesmerizing. Walkways are easy to navigate and the display boards helped us appreciate nature's power. Don't miss the stairs down to the bottom which follow the ancient water path...phenomenal. We spent about 90 minutes, but it won't take that long if you aren't camera-happy like us.Plus, it's all free. Easily the best of our day trip up the Icefields Parkway from Jasper.Tip: for best photos, go early in the day...lighting at this time provided excellent photographs.\"\"As others have stated, easy to find, easy hike, good up close to falls and the canyon. Can be crowded.\"Allow at least 45 minutes to explore up and down on both sides. Good little hiking opportunity with lots of scenic beauty.Athabasca falls are gorgeous and the thing that stands out for me is the roaring sound they make. The viewpoints are well placed and it is easy to take great photos!\"Just beautiful and well worth a visit. The hiking trail to the falls is short and fairly level. It is fabulous to visit at anytime of the year. Covered in ice or roaring in summer, the falls are just gorgeous.\"\"Really pretty. It's on the way to Jasper, easy to access and not to be missed. Easy hike, gorgeous pIctures.\"\"A powerful, and picturesque place just of the main highway. A series of waterfalls in a short slot canyon. Great photo ops. Be sure to take the trail down to the bottom.\"\"An interesting stop along the highway, the falls aren't anything spectacular but they're definitely worth visiting!\"\"Not a big set of falls, but lots of places to get great views. You get up close and personal with not only the falls, but the canyon and geological changes due to the river/falls. In the winter the falls freeze which is awesome to see!\"Beautiful spot to enjoy a morning coffee! Be sure to bring one to enjoy this impeccable view. Also carrying a camera is a must for this sight!!Not to far from the highway (so still noisy and not as peaceful as other spots in Jasper) and yet one of the best things to see in Jasper. Great hike and a great place for good pictures.Short stop but nothing exciting. Falls are not that tall compare to what you would expect in the rockies.\"I love these Falls! I had been here at least 10 times, and I enjoy it every time! Eventhough it's just a 22 meter hige, yet the fact that you can see it frome all angles and get very close to the falling water, makes it so special. Allow at least one hour at the falls.\"Located 30 km south (towards Banff) this is well worth a visit.The falls are well signposted like all the other sights along the icefield parkway so you wont miss it.Parking area is just a minutes walk from the falls so no long hike to get there.There are multiple viewing points and a bridge that crosses the gorge.The river cascades down a narrow gorge and there are potholes that have formed from the rocks grinding into the river bed.There is also a short but steep (with steps) walk down to the lake . Its only a 3-4 minute walk and worth doing. There is a vantage point just below the falls which gives a great view of the lake.\"Visited here on a Brewsters Jasper to Banff Glacier trip. Beautiful day with clear skies. Make sure you walk from the car park all the way round the other side to the falls, absolutely beautiful with the rainbow appearance.\"Two minutes from the highway. This falls is a must!! Breathtaking views. Plenty of parking spaces. Well signposted.This is a stunning place the visit. The noise and the views are spectacular. It doesn't cost you anything for such an amazing experience. Worth a look for sure.Minimal Hiking necessary and close from the Highway. A must on the way to Jasper. Refreshing.... takes less than 60 min\"Not the biggest waterfall I've ever seen, but certainly one of the most magical. I would not have been surprised to see fairies or gnomes walking on the green moss beside this waterfall. Extremely scenic; I found it enchanting!\"Walk all around the paths. Every view is worth. The rock formations are beautiful as well as the clear water falling. The place is clean and well preserved. A must when you are near Jasper.One of the easiest waterfalls to get to and one of the most spectacular. A must see. It was a hot day when we were there so it was easy to cool down in the spray plume on the far side of the falls.Very busy but understandably since it's such an awesome sight. Parking slightly difficult at busy times if you arrive in an RV.\"Easy walk, well worth it, can get busy late in the day, so try and be there early. Parking can also be problematic over weekends and Public Holidays\"\"We stopped off here on our way to Lake Louise. When we pulled into the car park there was a black bear having breakfast. What an amazing surprise. We watched it with several other people before it wandered through the Woods, walked casually down the pavement and then disappeared into the woodland.Oh, and the falls were good too!\"\"its a beautiful find in nature, but there are a lot of tourists. there is a small hike to the bottom of the falls, you can even put your feet in the water.\"\"A short distance from the Icefield Parkway, usually plenty of parking, and a tremendous view of what must be the greatest volume of water going over a waterfall in Western Canada.A second visit, slightly less water than in 2013, but then again, that was the year of the flooding in South Alberta. Still as spectacular, though\"These falls are right off the freeway and a short walk from the parking area. No admittance fee. Absolutely one of the most beautiful falls I have ever seen.\"Not mentioned in every guidebook, this is an up-close-and-personal experience with a high velocity waterfall. Found just back of a small car park beside the 'old road' from Banff to Jasper. No facilities or café/restaurant.... but stop here anyhow!\"\"A must for anyone travelling the icefield parkway, a short flat walk from the car park so within the ability of anyone with mobilty difficulties and so photogenic, particularly this time of year when the melt water is flowing strongly.One recommendation is if you have the time, to take the 93a to or from Jasper. The road is much slower and as such, much quieter. There are far more opportunities to see wildlife and it is nicer to travel at a slower pace\"\"You can't visit Jasper and not visit the Athabasca Falls. Well, you can, but you'd be mad to miss out on this. A fantastic example of the raw power of nature, beautiful and awe inspiring. It seems bizarre to think that watching water rush between rocks can be this thrilling.\"It is very pretty but go very early or late in the day when it isn't overrun with busloads of others.Very well-marked trails and informative guidance throughout. All of us tourists are reducing these places' viability!There are lots of waterfalls in Banff and Jasper National Parks but these are stunning and beautiful and easy for anyone to see. You can hear and feel the power of rushing water when you get near these falls. They are a short ways off the highway and an easy walk from the parking lot. The falls crash into a deep canyon with such force that the area is wet with spray and viewing areas are often a bit slippery. But these falls are well worth a viewing. A reminder of the power of water and the force of nature.\"Young or old this is a very doable, must see stop on the Icefield parkway. I know there are a million Falls to see but this one is so well layed out that you can see them from all sides. They flow north?!! for 6000 kilometers and enter the Arctic. Can't wrap your head around that but can see this natural wonder up front and personal!\"An excellent photo opportunity. Really worth the stop off. Hang on to the kids hands though .. it is wild country.\"The scenery at the falls was amazing, there is a walkway with railing around the area with lots of points to safely get the best view of the falls and rock formations.\"The ice parkway has sooooo many choices. This one is quite near Jasper and the falls are a short hop from the car. Really amazing - but they all are really !Don't miss this stop along the Columbia Icefields Parkway. The walk to the viewing platforms for the falls are a short walk and easily accessible for all levels. Further hiking is available.\"One of the best \"\"falls\"\" we saw during our trip around the Rockies well worth the visit. The restaurant was good also\"\"Nice, easy access to the best falls in area. Able to take different view shots of spectacular falls. Make sure you take the trail to the bottom to view canyon towards falls.\"\"It was busy with tourists, but worth the look!Loads of parking, and nice pathways.Spend time having \"\"your time\"\" with the falls as people can be pushy.\"\"Our tour made a stop at the Athabasca Falls. BEAUTIFUL!!! If anyone is in the area of Jasper, be sure to include this stop. The amount of water going over the falls is amazing. When stopping at the Columbia Icefields, you actually get to see where this river gets its start and how it enlarges over the miles traveling to the falls. A must see!\"A wonderful sight. The power of the turbulent water surging over the waterfall and around the rocks was magnificent.\"Loved these falls. Not suitable for people with poor mobility. Good view of both the 'top' and 'bottom' of the waterfall. Nice simple explanations of geology. Parking was sufficient, toilets nearby. No refreshments nearby offered.\"\"Lovely to see a water fall at eye level instead of from the ground looking up. Lovely scenery around the area as well. Seen many water falls and a lot larger than this one and I would rate it as average at best, but it is still worth a look on your travels especially if you are into this type of thing. Lots of people in cars and buses pull up so it is probably best to get there first thing in the morning if possible.\"\"This falls is down inside a rock gorge and makes a 90 degree turn as it falls. It is an easy and short walk from a parking lot off highway 93, \"\"The Icefields Parkway.\"\" The noise and power of the water is amazing. Definitely worth a stop and visit.\"Very impressive falls certainly worth a visit. Paths easy to walk around and you can get close enough to get wet. Plenty of car parking.It's a nice enough waterfall but nothing special - it's not worth going out of your way to visit. Surprised it's number 1 in things to do in Jasper.\"The force and velocity of the falls cannot be understood until you are standing in situ. It is quite breathtaking. If you can get away from the many tourists taking dangerous 'selfies' on the edge, it is a heavenly view ??\"Go early or later in the day though as it was packed with tourists when we were there so I wasn't too impressed. The canyon is pretty cool.This is definitely worth a visit if you are driving between Jasper and Lake Louise. The extraordinary roar of the water and the wonderful scenery all around are breath taking.\"Big, loud, and impressive. We were in Jasper and drove to this Falls to check it out quickly. It was so amazing that we stopped by again on the way back to Calgary.\"like every place in Banff/Jasper - arriving early during high season will improve your impression of these beautiful natural areas.

The loud noise of the water fall and the must from the great water fall will touch your heart with this beautiful nature!You Must See this attraction!\"\"Awesome awesome awesome. Powerful. Gorgeous. Go. No matter what physical condition you are in, you can do this.\"\"We did our road trip at the height of the drought and wildfire hazard time. The falls were beautiful. The people, however, were not very smart--despite all the signs everywhere about extreme wildfire hazards, and despite the level 4 drought warnings, people were smoking all over the trails around the falls. I just wish others could use some common sense when in nature. We drove through a region with about 360 wildfires. Why throw gasoline on the fire?\"\"This is part of what makes a vacation in the Canadian Rockies such a great experience. The falls are splendid ,the setting is picture perfect with the mountains in the background ,the rushing milky blue waters and the roar of the falls.The sound is captivating as you look with awe at the power of the water. The pathway and lookoutsare well positioned to give views from many angles.An abandoned canyon has a stairway down that helps give perspective to the magnitude of this natural wonder ,the rock is carved and etched layer by layer.This is a must see only 20 min from town of Jasper lots of parking , easy access even with children.\"\"Breathtaking scenery,was busy with people when we were therePlenty of parkingcareful walking, gets slippery\"\"This is a Must go to place in Jasper. love at first site. Gorgeous falls, scenic route. good for hiking.\"\"These falls are absolutely amazing, the strength of the water rushing down is awesome. I'm not sure if these falls has a walk around it, but be sure to do it. Not for the frail.\"So much water! A great water fall to witness the power of water. It's worth a quick stop to check out the falls.We could see the water mist rising and decided to take a look and so glad we did. We were surprised there weren't more people there to see the stunning Beaty and power of nature. Don't miss this one.A scenic view of a glacier spilling over rocks to sculpt them into gorgeous formations! A must see while in the area. We hiked through this with many other people so choose an early morning time if possible.\"The falls are beautiful! There is a short walk and should be good for people of any physical ability to enjoy, which is nice. We had taken the Athabaska Glacier tour a couple of hours before and were on our way to Jasper and made this stop. Super glad we did!\"\"Many signs to waterfalls in Alberta, Canada. The Athabasca is the one you just have yo visit. Experience the power of nature here. It's like the Niagara fall but on a smaller scale.\"Dropped by on our drive from Banff to Jasper. Really awe-inspiring and very accessible. It's silly to have to use 100 characters as there really isn't anything else to say\"Almost didn't bother stopping for these - glad we did! Very impressive, and you get a real sense of the power of nature. Lots of info on helpful boards, in particular about how dangerous they are, but this didn't stop a daft student perch on the railings to get the perfect selfie - she was lucky she didn't go for a last dive! Definitely recommend! You could spend a good few hours here just watching the water!\"\"You may have heard of it, you may have seen it, but Athabasca Falls is an incredible experience. My wife and I went to see Athabasca Falls recently, but it actually has to be \"\"experienced\"\" in person to fully appreciate the power and beauty that it is. From the sheer volume of water that pours over the falls each second to the deafening roar of the same, this is a place you must come and be in awe of the power of nature in action.

You will be glad you did.\"\"If you travel Jasper NP don't forget to stop the Athabasca Falls.It is said that 15 million cubic meter of water per second !! will flow down these falls.Striking awesome !\"We have been to Banff and Jasper parks. This was one of the most impressive sights we've seen. One can really appreciate the power of nature.We were there early in July and the falls were full and spectacular. This is well worth the short hike.\"A must do on the Ice field parkway it is around 20 minutes before Jasper town heading from Calgary or Banff. Please do the complete trail which is not very arduous, There is a circle loop to view the falls , the canyon lookout, the pot holes, and a trail down to the river bed. The gushing Athabasca river gushes down and the fine spray of water from certain points is so refreshing.\"\"A must see! The wonder of nature. Many photo opts here. You will be amazed at the beauty of the falls. From the falls we took Hwy 1A, it is well worth the time for the scenic trip.\"I was tired of visiting all the lakes and glaciers and was wondering if I must make a stop here. I am glad I did.

The falls are gorgeous, and it's worth taking 15 minutes to walk along the various viewing platforms and take lots of photos!\"\"These falls were the last sightseeing stop on our Brewster Tours trip between Lake Louise and Jasper. We didn't have that much time there and it started to rain. There were some nice bits to it, and if we had more time it would have been good to explore more.\"there is a small trail that provides several different views of the falls. Take the time to see this site!Rated number one probably because of its easy access and beauty. Power of the water is amazing.

Stay on marked trails so your loved ones don't have a reason to make a memorial for you.\"While not as high nor wide, you really can get close to these falls. An interpretative walking trail explains the wildlife, fauna and geological highlights. An easy stop off the road and the price is right -- FREE,\"\"Just a short walk from the car park which is itself close to the highway. Cooling mist rises, the flow of the falls is impressive, the crowds less so. Fairly tame whitewater rafting from the bottom of the falls.\"Beautiful falls. Involves some walking so not suitable for anyone that is bad on their feet or wheelchair user.

At that time of the year the ice and water low thank goodness for that because the people walking on the ice at that could be semi safe foolish thing to do,but people will be people.

By watching and observing all this we learn from the simple things.\"This really is a must and is one of the best smaller water falls outside of South America and should not be missed.I enjoyed taking photos there.

Informative sign boards along the pathways.\"Parking busy but we found a spot right away. Short walks over excellent trails and great views of the falls.

Also stopped at Sunwapta Falls, also well worth taking a driving break to see.\"\"You could stop here really quickly and it is a great view! The parking lot is right there, and the walk was flat as well.\"Well worth a stop. Great falls and very milky water during summer due to glacial deposits. Good views of nearby mountains.Spectacular waterfalls pulsing with frothing turbulence and sparkling power. It was so awesome to watch from high above the water rage through the rock formations. No photos can truly capture the speed of the water as it dashes through the hewn rock walls.\"Definitely worth a visit, as everything on our self guided (Lonely Planet & info from Visitor Centres) tour seems to be. Easy to access the main area from the car park - OK for wheelchairs & babybuggies. The falls were a raging torrent when we visited, & throwing up rainbows. You can also view from different levels via steps & bridges & see the difference in the water colour where it enters the main river.\"Close to Jasper (about 20 miles away - close by Canadian standards) and well worth a visit.

On the far side of the falls one of the viewpoints is so close to the churning water you can almost reach out and touch it.\"I have seen falls in the Blue Mountains in Australia but these were spectacular, certainly worth a visit.\"\"We have been here in the summer and winter and both were spectacular! Summer you will see the blue/green and muddy glacier water rush over the falls and swirl I the 'potholes'. In the with two the water is lower, but the mist freezes looking like whip cream floating above the rushing water. Easy paved hike. Some steps. Great picture overlooks.\"\"Stopping to view these falls, we had no idea what to expect. Wow! The end of the lake tapered to a powerful surge of water pouring over the rocks with an observation bridge above.

There are lots of areas to explore and you can walk down to the river bed below and put your feet in the water. Great stop.\"\"On the main road leading to Jasper are these impressive falls on the Athabasca River. While not as big, they seemed as violent and breathtaking as Niagra.

There are no facilities other than outside toilets at this stop.\"\"The Athabasca Falls change a little every time you go, but they never fail to impress. Jasper National Park has made this a wonderful, safe explore.

If able, go down the mouth of the falls and sit on the beach, it's gorgeous and so tranquil!\"If driving the icefield this is worth a short visit. Well planned trails with about 50 steps to get down to the canyon and a few more to river. However best views are from the top and only takes 10 mins - about as long as it took us to park. Not the most impressive falls but pretty scenery so worth caling\"Athabasca Falls are about 30 km south of Jasper, so about 1/2 hour drive. The falls have cut a deep canyon. At the main falls there is a lot of spray, so in the mornings, you can often see rainbows in it. Several walk ways allow you to look down into the canyon. At the right time of year you can see the rare calypso orchids growing here. There are signs telling people not to go beyond the barriers, but silly people do - and occasionally someone falls in and dies. Don't go beyond the barriers - the rocks are slippery - the photo isn't worth it.\"Easy trail and the spectacular view is totally worth it. We even saw some animals in the way (birds and squirrels).It was smaller than I expected. 10 minute walk around and you've seen it all. Still very pretty though. A much much smaller version of Malinge Canyon.\"These falls are magnificent. They're not high, but show the power of water. A must see. They're a short distance from the road and are easy to get to.\"We stumbled upon these falls. They are some of the best falls I have seen. Be sure not to miss the turn off for these.\"The Banff-Yoho-Jasper National parks are filled with breath taking views and at least 6-8 lovely waterfalls, of which tos is one. It is about 20 miles south of Jasper and an easy walk from the Icefields Highway.\"Lovely view of a different kind of waterfall. it comes out of the rock into a cave and down again into a box canyon. Easy access.\"Our guided tour of the Falls treated us to lovely falls and scenic views as well as interesting info about Jasper and climate change in the area. After our short hike, we also learned about the wildlife in the area. We saw a bear!\"These wont be the biggest falls or the widest falls you've ever seen but they are worth a stop because you can get very close to them and the noise and power of the water is quite thrilling.Pull over and spend the time. Fabulous falls and great parking. Walkways friendly to all levels of mobility.\"Very pretty, not a hike, you drive right to it, it was very pretty, worth turning off the hwy for. We really enjoyed the Athabasca Falls.\"\"When we left the carpark to walk along the path to the falls, I thought this doesn't look like it's going to be much of a waterfall. No, it's not in the category of Niagara but it definitely is still awesome in it's own right. The river is wide and the falls are narrow and to see the intensity of the volume of water gushing through was amazing. We walked down the steps to see the water gushing through the canyon to continue into the river at the bottom. Enjoyed visiting this spot and it's an easy walk from the car park\"who well go to jasper ..there is some places have to and must have to see athabaca falls on the why onlyBeautiful falls but be careful! We saw way too many people climbing over rails to take pictures. Visit the falls early in the morning or after dinner to avoid crowdsWe really enjoyed seeing the falls again. Easy to access a short walk from the parking lot. One can take a short trail to vother viewpoints as well.\"A must see! Easy mostly flat paved walk, worth the few mins if takes. You can walk to both sides of the falls very easily. Make sure you walk to the other side, in the morning hours the spray from the falls creates a beautiful rainbow that you can take a picture of. There are restrooms here. They are of the outhouse sort..but better then the old fashion ones with the moon cut out windows!This should only take 20 mins but there are trails here if you wish to hike around.\"\"On the suggestion of the Columbia icefields bus driver, we stopped in at Athabasca Falls. It is a great spot to see the power of running water. Parks Canada has done well with the site to makes sure it is safe for families. It has lots of information on site about the Falls and its continual formation.\"A very short walk from the parking lot. A fairly powerful little falls. The walk ways take you close enough to feel the spray of the falls. Wonderful sounds of nature! No reason to pass this one by.\"This beautiful fall, although not too high, but created over centuries, many small, but complicated openings due to the soft rocks. Spending a few hours trying to understand the geological puzzle of cutting the rocks, due to shear force of water, over years, can earn you a doctoral degree. So, enjoy the beauty of the fall and leave your mind for the imagination !!\"\"My family (young son, wife) and I visited many falls in our travels and this is one of the best in terms of viewing and proximity to the fall itself (while maintaining safety). There are a few viewpoints that are easily access from the parking lot. Needless to say, it is a busy place during the summer, but not overcrowded in my opinion.\"Great opportunity to stand on a glacier. Temp was 95 degrees day we were there. On the glacier it was about 40 degrees. You can see five glaciers from one viewpoint. The skywalk shouldn't be missed. The also have a restaurant and cafe.I took my four year old to the falls. It was easy to get to and the pathways around the falls were well maintained and easy to follow. Excellent views and photo opportunities.We stopped off to see the falls when driving from jasper to lake Louise. The falls were spectacular in June as there was quite a good flow to the river. For me the most interesting part of the falls was the old discussed falls. Thousands of years ago the water changed course to the new falls. So you can now walk down the old falls canyon. You can see the years upon years of water against rock fighting against each other.\"The falls are magnificent in their splendor. Viewing and hearing the sound of cascading water splashing downward and over the fallen rocks along with forming rainbows at just about at every turn, is breathtaking. Be sure and notice how the water, over a great number of years, has carved through the rocks. The falls are only about a 40 minute drive from Jasper and are well worth the visit. There is no charge for viewing or parking.\"\"We were travelling from Jasper to Lake Louise and had heard seeing the Falls was a worthwhile detour and it certainly was. Given the melting snow, the Falls were impressive to see.\"\"Beautiful place!Even on a cloudy and rainy day it was beautiful. I imagine it in winter how amazing it would be.Worth a stop.\"The Athabasca Falls are spectacular and definitely warrant a 45 minute stop while traveling the Icefields Parkway in Jasper National Park. They are memorable because of the erosion of the rocks along the sides of the falls.This is a very easy walk to see the falls from several angles. Signs explained the color of the water and the surrounding areas. If you were willing you could make an easy walk down to where the falls emptied into a large river. Handrails and solid steps made the time there a treat.this was a quick stop while touring and hiking. Short walk to beautiful waterfalls. Can get very close to feel the power of the raging water.\"June is a good time the melt waters are still coming, but not in huge spring quantities, all adds to the attraction. Take time to walk around and enjoy, away from the crowds.\"\"Too many tourists stop when they see the falls, thinking that's all there is to see. Keep climbing higher until you are at the top of the falls for the most impressive views and the roaring sound of the falls. It's also a great spot to have your photo taken or to take a selfie.\"Be sure to visit all levels of the fall. This is the best one in the park. Also go up to the ice fields on the east end. I highly recommend Jasper! They take credit cards. 9.80 CD for adults under 65.\"very nice easy walk and you already can hear the sound,coming from dry and hot California,it was so beautiful,we stay long time there.It was great, MUST SEE.\"Wonderful views on the way from Jasper to Lake Louise. Would recommend a stop over point at this area. You can walk easily to the waterfall for a great view.\"Pounding falls, misty gorges, interesting geology, wildflowers. Lots of photo opportunities, but watch all the mist on your lenses!\"Not the biggest falls by any means but the setting and the splendour of the falls makes it a spot not to missIt is so amazing the power water has on rock. The erosion from centuries of flow is very prevalent and leaves you in awe. Easy walk around the area and lots of parking. very glad we stopped as there are so many other places to stop along the way. No fee once you are in the park.\"Liked: views, great place to get some good pictures.Dislikes: too many people and a lot of dogs when we went.\"\"Impressive but busy. Parking was a major challenge. However, the spray from the falls was natural air conditioning on a very hot day.\"The falls are simply beautiful! Well worth the stop. It is certainly a place to stop and spend some time at. We were there for about 45 minutes.Having read reviews on Trip we decided to stop off to stretch our legs and it was well worth it. Only a short walk from the car park to see the full force in all its glory is s treatThese falls are some of the best I've seen. Unlike Niagara Falls they thunder through a rather small opening and then travel through a canyon with more falls and whirlpools before eventually flowing out into a wide river below. Make sure you walk all around as there are many advantage spots to view these falls. Just off the Icefields Parkway so very easy to get to.One of our favourite sites that we visited whilst in the Jasper area.Great torrents of water and fantastic viewing points where you can really experience the power of the water.Also an interesting opportunity to walk through an expired section where the water previously ran and a view of the river after the falls\"Visited here today and the river was raging over the falls. Huge amounts of water and it was a very impressive sight. Not too busy, good parking, easy access. Would definitely recommend to anyone on the Icefields Parkway!\"\"Each time we go to Athabasca Falls we get a sense of magnificence. The overwhelming power of the water, the etched stones from hundreds of years of pounding and the beautiful figures carved into the stone from the whirlpools continue to amaze. When you go, be sure to take the side paths down to the basin. Most of the visitors only go to the lookouts so taking the paths less travelled will truly take you into the past and allow you to enjoy the pounding water and otherwise total silence of this lovely area.If you have children, please be careful to watch them closely as there are lots of access points that would be easy for the children to climb and fall over. Your children will, as those we watched during our visit, be amazed and curious and love the fact that they have to yell at their parents to be heard over the rush of water around them. Enjoy!\"\"Athabasca Falls is on the Icefields Parkway about a half hour out of Jasper, and if you're driving that way, you must stop there! They are phenomenal. It's only a two minute drive from the highway and a five minute walk after that. Someone has out a lot of care into the boardwalk and bridge over the falls. The trees have been cleared just enough to give you great views from all sorts of angles, and they've attended to your other senses as well, with one little nook where the roarnif the waterfall is amplified and another where you can stand in the spray (try it, it's fun!). Things are well-marked (the sign at the start of the trail down to the base of the waterfall even reminds you that you will have to come up again!) and well-maintained. We loved it!\"\"Lots of parking despite arriving at peak time (11:00)Still plenty of places to look at the falls.Well placed educational plaques\"Beautiful the colour of the water and the power of it was amazing.Worth the walk enjoyed just watching the water in such great surroundingsGreat trip onto the glacier by bus. really a must do. Had fun getting up and personal on the glacier\"Amazing falls, but take your insect repellent as you will be eaten alive.......oh and watch out for Japanese tourists that have expensive cameras with huge lens, they virtually take up residence.......they have come a long way for their holiday snaps!\"Wonderful Water Falls -- it stands out as one of the more spectaculat sites of this spectacular parkThis place is a must to stop in Jasper. The falls are huge and beautiful to see. There is also a path that leads you to see corners and hidden places. Sometimes is gets busy specially on summer time.It was an easy walk from car-park on made footpaths. The volume of water flowing over the falls was immense with the recent snows melting. Plenty of great photo opportunities from each side of the falls. The reminder of a fatality on the seating showed how dangerous the falls could be.\"Beautiful, large glacier. It's a quick stop and then a bit of a hike if you want to get a nicer view. It's quite windy, so I'd wear a jacket.\"Pictures can not justify the beauty of this place! Loved it. Be careful and don't fall over - they will never find your body in all that whirlpool at the bottom. Other then safety precautions - this place is amazing. Loved the stairs - so cool. We were camping and took a trip to check out the falls. A must see in Jasper. xxGreat stop on your way up to Jasper. We didn't have time to stop on way the Icefields Parkway but made sure we stopped on our way back to Calgary. I glad we didn't miss it. Very pretty. Make sure you view the Falls from all the different viewpoints.\"It's difficult to tell what is more beautiful in The Rockies Mountain, everything is a breath taking view wherever you go. This fall is amazing like every lake and Avery corner of this park. Super paradise!\"This is a must if you are in the area. I think these must be the most gushing falls on the Icefields Parkway. Be careful - access is not easy in places as the path is slippery and there are steps. But it is certainly worth the climb if you can manage the steps.\"If you're a nature-lover, a visit to Athabasca Falls will not disappoint. There are several view decks on a well-designed walkway.\"\"Only a short drive outside Jasper. We visited in early June, well before the heavy tourist season. It's amazing to see the power of the water and you can feel the ground and lookouts tremble from the flow. No complaints here, but I could see the lookouts, trails and bridges being very crowded during high season.\"Lovely views and scenery. Worth a visit and don't forget to take your camera. High volume of water when we visited. Would recommend a visitGreat stop along the road. The river is gently flowing until it roars over the falls plunging into a deep canyon. There are locations were the water has swirled and eroded the rocks to create 'pot holes' and there are many locations to view various portions of the river and canyon. Easy trail and rest rooms available.\"In normal circumstances these falls would be a must see but, as there are so many wonderful sights along this route, you need to consider whether to include this. Preferably youu should and allow at least 30 minutes for your visit.\"Well worth stopping at the Athabasca Falls. Amazing how all this water snakes its way down the gorge. Easy access. Fantastic scenery. Our day was all the more amazing by having a rainbow appear above our heads in a photograph!\"A must see if you're in Jasper! It's set up really well to view the falls and there are a few different paths you can take to see the lake etc. Really beautiful, I would love to go back again! Great view of the mountains as well.\"We particularly enjoyed the sculptured potholes and the rock formations created by the force of the water.Seeing these falls was an amazing experience. Be careful not to miss the turnout because it is not very well marked. The falls just roar through the rocks and then you can take a quick hike down to see where they come out into a wide river that is a beautiful silt-filled blue.Absolutely beautiful. It is a must stop on the way to Jasper. (About 20 min. from town of Jasper. Gorgeous area around the falls with walkway. Perfect picture taking areas.\"Just of Hwy93 - free parking, washroom facilities, easy access to viewing areas. The falls are quite small but very dramatic. The walkways let you see the falls from different viewpoints and they are wheelchair friendly too.\"\"Great location to view the incredible change in the river from fast flowing to thunderous waterfall. I think the early explorers must have had some fear when they saw the mist from the Falls as they were approaching this feature.Make sure when you have seen the Falls and if heading back to Jasper, you take the old 93A back. This is the old Icefields Parkway road and can offer some incredible wildlife and scenery if taken later in the day when the temperatures are cooler.\"A tourist stop on the Highway between Jasper and lake Louise these falls are well presented in that there are good walkways so you can see and enjoy the falls\"Easy access from car park, and the best waterfall have ever seen. A must do for travellers to this area.\"What can one say about this incredible falls. It winds through the rock formation and forms swirling cul-de-sac like cuts in the rock. A very good place to visit in Jasper National Park.This is one of the popular stops on the road between Lake Louise and Jasper. Its only a short walk to the falls which are quite spectacular especially as it was mid-snow melt when we visited. There are great pathways and bridges so you can check it out from various vantage points. A red squirrel wasn't worried about the bus load of other tourists around. We also had a chat to the National Park rangers who had an educational display near the car park.This is one of the prettiest falls in Jasper. The intricately carved slot Ravine just across the bridge at the Falls is really a sight to see as well.\"We visited in June and the water levels were very high. The falls are stunning and you can get a variety of views from in front and behind. Allow at least 30 minutes.Not to be missed, if you are anywhere near.\"Beautiful water falls. Steep in areas. Nice pathway. Need to keep close eye on children while visiting.Nice waterfalls. We did not walk the entire path but waterfalls deserve a look. These falls are close to Jasper.\"Definitely worth stopping off for 20 minutes en route to Jasper. Compared to Johnson Canyon it is a brief and easy (five minute) walk from the spacious car park to get the best views of the falls, and at 6pm on a Friday evening was not too overrun with tourists. As others have said, photos do not do it justice. The impressive thunderous noise, the spray, the rainbow effects created, the marvellous rocky and forested backdrop, the milky white Athabasca River - it's energising and inspiring - and so accessible (for able bodied folk). Just be careful with the steps further along the trail which lead down to the river. They can get muddy and slippery if it is/has been raining. We arrived just after a heavy downpour and had to watch our step!\"A nice stop and a ahort walk to the falls. Not overrun. To get there use the less busy 97A. The walk is an easy 1 km stroll along the falls. You really get very close.\"The falls are located in a lovely park setting with clean restrooms, picnic areas and a short walk to view the falls from several different locations, all stunning....a very nice place to stop for a rest....although be mindful of bears.....and it's free!!!!\"The roar of the falls and the movement of water in the air cannot be captured by photos. These falls are definitely worth a stop. Make sure you take the time to walk the well paved paths to above and below the falls. Parking was easy and we were lucky enough to be there when there were no tour buses so we had plenty of space to enjoy it. I also marvelled at the beautiful rocks and trees. We spent about 30 minutes there and had had plenty of time for photos and walking the paths.Worth the stop as the falls are amazing & incredibly beautiful. Short walk from car park & worth a break as the force of water is phenomenal. Very beautiful too.Crashing falls and a great walk around the area easily accessible with plenty of parking. Well worth a visit.\"Athabasca Falls are one of the main tourist attractions on the Icefields Parkway, Hwy 93, between Jasper and Lake Louise. Access is very easy from the highway. Parking is freely available. The paths to the main viewpoints are wheelchair friendly, although other paths are not suitable. The size of the falls vary with the season, in June with the snow melt and runoff, the volume and speed of the water is spectacular. The paths are well fenced and very safe for all the family.\"\"You must stop by these falls they are so pretty and so close to the road, as well there is a parking spot and rest rooms there\"\"The Athabasca Falls are small but a powerful, picturesque waterfall. Athabasca Falls is not known so much for the height of the falls (23 meters), as it is known for its force due to the large quantity of water falling into the gorge. We viewed the falls safely and photographed it from various viewing platforms and walking trails around the falls.\"\"A lovely rustic location. The falls has several bridges and a few walking paths. No interpretive facilities. Plan to be self directed and definitely observe all safety signage and guard rails. Bring a nice camera. Also be sure to check in out in the winter, the frozen water makes amazing patterns.\"\"A short walk from the Icefields Parkway, a beautiful, powerful waterfall roars down the mountains. When the sun hits the spray, viewers are treated to a beautiful rainbow which is easily captured in photographs. The view is captivating, and if you can tear yourself away from this view, the trail continues on for the more fit and adventurous.\"Stunning with lots of trail walking opportunities. Falls were very accessible and it's possible to sit by the steams\"This was such an amazing sight. Our children loved it and our driver had some great stories about this waterfall that really captured our children's imaginations. Seeing this waterfall from several angles is a must. From one angle, the water falls in such a way that it creates an stunning rainbow. We loved this!\"\"This area is beautiful! And without all that icky tackiness of Niagara Falls! The parking lot is big. There's washrooms (well, outhouses, but whatever, they're outdoors). One washroom door was busted with no lock so beware! It was raining when we went but still good to see. The cement pathways are uneven and as a result, water from the rain made huge puddles keeping us from walking everywhere. But hopefully you get to go on a nice day where this isn't an issue! There's a lot of mist and the temperature drops a little!There are boards all over providing educational information regarding the falls and the pot holes. You can walk through a cavern-like part which had formally been battered by the same water from the falls many, many years ago. You can look at the walls and marvel at the might of the rock and the force it endured. The pothole was interesting too...but looked a bit gross what with old, stagnant water being in it. You can keep walking down some very steep steps and get to the river where we seen excited people start rafting. I wouldn't recommend doing this when it's raining like we did because of how slippery and narrow it was. There's fences all over and past warnings not to leave the designated areas, because it's both dangerous AND destorys the environment by destroying the rocks and grass! There was a bench in memory to a young 21 year old man who fell off of those falls to his death. I felt it was a heartfilled gestured by his loved ones and a good reminder to stay safe! You must check this place out. It's a mighty falls despite not being as big as Niagara. I can see why so many love it!\"Highly turbulent water in a massive volume from the Athabasca River. You need to watch your step and stick to the path as this place has claimed the lives of those who took risks. Well worth the visit.\"Where do you start. Trying to describe the sound of the thundering water and volume of water that is cascading over the falls is near impossible. Just stand there, watch and listen.This is the power of water as the river funnels into a narrow canyon and down between the rocks sending up fine mist sprays.The park is easy accessible by car from highway 93, south of Jasper. Take care to follow the pathway and don't cross the fences as it can be a very dangerous.This is a must see on your Canadian Rockies adventure.\"\"Because it was such a short distance to the falls, I wasn't expecting much, so boy, was I surprised. These falls are very impressive. You can stay with 95% of the visitors and feel very claustrophobic viewing them or you walk walk a little ways and get a different view and less people. You can also walk downstream a ways and see the immediate calmness after the falls. It is a great little stop. Don't miss it.\"You need to see how the force of the water carved out the stone..amazing! Loved the beauty of the waterfalls and the power it generated.\"Pretty much a must see if you are in the area. Spectacular view and great place to take a lot of photos. If you are there in the early a.m. make sure you use mosquito repellent, the mosquitoes are thick.\"\"Athabasca Falls is a very pretty waterfall and canyon close to Jasper. It’s a short walk from the parking lot to the falls, with a couple of views of the Athabasca River along the way, flowed by a nice view of the falls. Then you reach a bridge across the river below the falls, and three viewpoints of the falls on the far side of the river. Finally, there is a trail to the lower canyon for better views of the canyon itself. We spent an hour here, enjoying the view and taking photos and could have stayed longer. Note — there is no running water or drinking fountains here, so come prepared!\"\"For some reason it is hard to describe what makes these falls so interesting, the thunder of the water, the sheer volume going over the falls, but this is one of the places you must see in Jasper.\"\"These falls are beautiful! A great place for a walk to stretch your legs, an easy short hike from the parking area. We loved how accessible these were.\"\"Worth a visit, if you're on the road it's a stone's throw from route 93, and everything is right there. There isn't really a hike just different bits you walk round/different angles to look at it. Then if you go down you can meet the lake at the bottom which is very pretty.\"\"We loved these falls, more spectacular than the swapta ones. Beware of the mosquitos though there were many!!!!\"\"Its just a couple of minutes walk from the car park and totally worth the effort, the falls are powerful and simply stunning.\"\"What an example of the power of water. As the river funnels into a narrow chasm in the rocks, it thunders over the falls, sending up a spray, and creating rainbows.\"Every time I visit Jasper I always stop and visit Athabasca Falls. Its beauty never ceases to amaze me. It can get very crowded so its best to go early morning or later in the afternoon. Definitely worth a stop even if you only have a few minutes.\"Love Athabasca Falls! Don't miss out on this one, just a beautiful spot of nature and a nice drive to get there as well!\"Beautiful canyons and falls just a very short easy walk from the car park. Go early to avoid the crowds a must see.\"Athabasca Falls are all about the raw power of nature! Just tons and tons of water smashing down below!There are numerous paths to explore the area, but like Maligne Canyon the water is the reason you visit!\"It is just off the main highway and it is definitely worth a stop. Can view the falls from both sides of the river. Also made a trip down to the water's edge. The path down was cut by water long ago and it was an awesome sight. It was an easy walk up and down although there was a warning sign about the number of steps down.Athabasca Falls is worth stopping for. The power of the falls and the immense canyons will take your breath away. Just wonderful.Beautiful and powerful! There was even a rainbow in one area of the falls! A definite must see on the Icefield Parkway!\"If you like waterfalls (I do) then these falls are not to be missed. Not huge, but quite spectacular, with a lot of water going over them. About a 200m walk from the car park, so not far to walk on firm tarmac.\"\"The falls are just beautiful! It is a nice place to walk around, great scenery. Definitely worth a visit.\"\"How can anyone give this 3 stars as average? It's really impressive and well worth a visit as there is a lot to see. We drove from Banff to jasper but went on the glacier and skywalk tours so did not visit the falls on the way up. Once in jasper we went back, about half an hour, to see the falls and I'm glad we did it that way as we could appreciate them more.\"\"Athabasca Falls and its canyon makes an extraordinary site. Come and get impressed, inspired by the force of nature. I've been here a couple of times and always I have the feelings of wonder. The park is easy accessible by car from hwy 93 South of Jasper. There are pathways around the waterfalls and steps through the canyon for you see this monument of nature from different angles.\"Nature at it's most powerful. The roar of the falls is a great reminder of the strength of Mother Nature.\"Just a short drive from Jasper, with a bear sighting on the way... the falls are beautiful. Easy walking around, well worth a visit.\"Absolutely spectacular - amazing scenes and breath taking views - there is nothing to dislike - unique once in a lifetime experienceWhen the water is running this is powerful sight to see. Parking is close by and the walks to the falls are easy. Great place for pictures and exploring the falls.\"An easy walk from the parking lot, Athabasca Falls is so beautiful. The National Park Service did a great job creating multiple view points and angles for watching the falls. It is well worth the time to stop and make this little walk. This is a stunning waterfall.\"Beautiful falls by Jasper. Very scenic and a lovely place to visit. I would highly recommend it - make sure you bring your camera.Just another wonderful experience on our trip through the Rockies. This was enhanced by the wonderful bus driver and company\"This is a not miss attraction, the rush of water was beautiful and noisy, and although I could not walk the full walk what I saw will remain with me\"\"About the only thing that keeps this site from being a 5 star is the lack of information and history of the site. The entrance to the Falls is well marked. There is plenty of parking. The majority of the paved paths are easy for anyone to move over. The grade is relatively flat. However, there are steps and some unusual rock formations in the outer areas that could challenge folk with unsteady legs/feet. But, if you don't have problems getting around, I can highly recommend you explore the path that follows the river until it flows into the wider river...about 100 yds.Certainly a place to see on your way to or from Jasper!\"\"Not the biggest or best, wildest or wettest but it is a great example of where a big river hits rock and cuts it way through creating a torrent. If you are in the area it's a must do stop. Watch out for Mosquitos in lower river area\"We were overrun by rude Asian tourists who insisted on forcing their way between my camera lens and the falls.When travelling on my Canada trip with my mum abs sisterThe visit was on my own tour just gif info from research and went for itDid the trip to Canary coach to Banff 2 days then coach to jasper 2 nights before our rocky mountaineer to Vancouver\"The falls were awesome. I am a big fan of waterfalls of all varieties. Since this had water that was falling, I thought it was pretty cool.\"A good falls with canyon like rock formation... close to the highway and must see for Jasper visitors\"Athabasca falls is a great little walk with big rewards, these fals are easy to access and would be great for families with kids or mobility reduced people.\"Really worth the very short detour off the Icefield's Parkway. Great viewing platforms giving a wide range of views of the Falls.\"I have been to Athabasca Falls numerous times throughout my life. It never gets boring!This spot is great for anyone. You can view the falls from the top, and if you're more agile, walk down the stairs to the river at the bottom. There are a couple of trail heads from this site, so look ahead to plan your day. Remember to have fun, but respect the signs and fences; don't end up dead for the sake of a picture.\"\"Athabasca falls is very beautiful and the drive out to the falls is worth doing on it's own. Like many other places in Jasper there are informative signs everywhere, helping you learn and understand more. The facilities at the falls were well kept and clean. Also similar to most places and things to do in Jasper, there were lots of people there. Because of this, I would recommend going earlier or later in the day.\"\"A very pretty spot, but stay in bounds, dont be dumb and die. Easy access and a beautiful walk fun for all ages.\"\"This beautiful falls are just on the way between Jasper and the Colombia ice field. great place to stop for a break, enjoy the nature and even have a picnic there. you can find a lot of parking, tables, washrooms and great atmosphere , and it's all for free.\"\"I've always liked to gaze at natural waterfalls, and this one certainly didn't disappoint. There was a series of concrete pathways that afforded numerous views of the falls and surrounding areas that made for some great photography opportunities.\"Great falls and great beauty. Follow the rules. Stay off the rocks. People fall in and die. It is an easy drive from Jasper proper and we go frequently.My sister and I visited Maligne canyon on a recent visit to Jasper. The view of the mountains behind the falls will take your breath away. Very easy hiking and most is stroller friendly. Great hiking trails through the forest as well!peaceful relaxing great place to take photos bring bug spray and please stay on the paths there are fences for a reason make sure you check out all the trails\"My wife and I along with 8 friends boarded a Raft and experienced the rapids. We didn't have to do a thing, the young man who handled the navigation did it all single handedly. The \"\"rapids\"\" weren't nearly as bad as I thought they might have been, but that doesn't detract from the skill of our young person. I enjoyed getting sprayed, others, not so much. Great fun, great experience.\"\"This a must see if the raw power of nature is what you an to see, great place to take that one of a kind photo!The earlier in the year the better the falls will be as the amount of water going through this area is more in the Spring than in the fall,but at any time this a great place to spend time.Take care to follow the pathway and do not cross the fences as it can be a very dangerous place to any one not acquainted with the power of water. So be careful and enjoy one of the true wonders of the Canadian Rockies!\"Another of those sights when you visit The Rockies that make you say wow! Well worth a visit. This was just one of the places we went to on our trip and I'd recommend this to anyone visiting Jasper National Park. The colour of the water is amazing.\"This is a must see on your trip through the rockies!Absolutely stunning!The water is such an amazing colour and the sheer force of nature creates that amazing rushing, pounding sound that's a little scary and a lot mesmerising!\"\"An amazing sight as the lake water pours over the rocks into crevices and caves. If you are lucky enough to be there without 500 other tourists, you will enjoy the sight-seeing and photography.\"\"Great to get out of the coach and walk around, great photo opportunities and a good cafe on site. The falls were still frozen from winter, so we didnt see it at its best\"\"Beautiful at any time of year. Gets very crowded in summer so visit in Spring, Fall and Winter if you can.\"A must see if you are visiting Jasper Nation Park!! So beautiful! You can be standing right over top and make your way down to the beautiful lake!\"Glorious waterfall pouring into a narrow rocky defile. Good for families and the disabled. One of the park's highlights, so bound to be crowded during the peak season.\"\"Really a beautiful short hike around the Falls and worth the drive to see, about 40 mins outside of Jasper.\"Outhouses were ill equipped; water level was very low at the falls; the mountain nearby was great for viewing & photography.My 21 month old daughter loves it here. The waterfall is beautiful and the walkways are pretty cool. Will visit again in the future.\"Great stop for photos and walk along the river and edge of the falls. Always some idiots climbing over the railings to walk on the rocks - very dangerous. There have been fatalities, Restrooms on the site for the mid-way bladder break.\"We were on our way to Mt. Edith Cavel and the road there was closed due to construction so we proceeded to Athabasca Falls. the walk was easy and the sights were beautiful. Not as long as Maligne canyon and easier if you have mobility problems. Great for a short hike.We have seen Athabasca Falls on every one of our trips to Jasper. It is right on the main highway and thus easily accessible. It is very popular with tour buses and so we suggest going early eve or very early morning (before 8:30) if you want to be there without the big crowds. It is beautiful at all times of the year!It is well designed for viewing but be careful not to go outside of viewing areas as it can be slippery and dangerous. The little walk down to the lake is very nice in the summer. Bugs can be bad in the area so bring your spray. Totally worth a visit for anyone. Don't miss it!Quite spectacular small falls (nothing like Niagara!). Lots of rushing water; you could walk down to near where the falls fell if you wanted.Easy walk affords multiple views of the falls. We visited in spring so still a bit icy underfoot we did not walk to the lower part of the falls. Picnic tables if you wanted to stop for lunch. Although it is awkwardly situated close to Jasper after the icefields it is quite close to the main road and worth a stop.Easy walking for all on man made trail. Nice in winter and summer. Depending when you go the blue color of the water will be intense.\"Went there mid april, the weather wasn't too good, some parts were still frozen but we loved it. Very peaceful place since we were almost the only people there!Will definitely check it out again one day in summer!\"\"This is very close to Jasper and must visit. It is a good hike an walk and we spent an hour plus doing the loqer and upper falls areas. The views are gorgeous, great pictures, it is a few kms off the hwy on the icefield pkwy route. The lower falls allows u to hike closer to the river . The falls has water at very high speed.\"This is a place that should be seen. Take an extra hour and sit and relax and just enjoy. Great for families BUT extra care must be taken as there are some very dangerous areas . There is bench on the far side of the falls that was donated by the parents of a young man that accidentally went OUT of BOUNDS and over the falls. So keep a good handclasp on youngsters.\"Nice stop on the way out of Jasper, definitely get out of the car and take a walk! Access to falls , canyon and the river.\"a nice trail leads you to the falls that are stunning. The water was pretty steady coming over the falls and a ranger working in the area was nice and stopped by to tell us what it looks like in the spring time when the water shoots over the edge about 80 feet out! The falls were cool and the path to walk along was nice and has a couple bridges and places to stop and watch the creek. We found and put back a couple of neat fossils as well. A need to do if you are in the area!\"Had A great afternoon drive & adventure from Jasper. Falls were very nice. Quite a few crazys who were going RIGHT up to the edges though. ..There we No warning signs that we saw on the east /parking lot side. But on the west side there's A big sign warning people of what Not To Do & even a Memorial bench for some silly guy who died \"\" Trying to be cool\"\" Sad.\"While driving the icefield parkway for sure stop to see this waterfall. You've a great five on the waterfall from different spots and if you take te steps down you can see the canyon too. Only takes about 30 min to visit.\"We went in mid-April and there was a ton of ice, but it was still beautiful. Seeing how the water has cut a canyon out of the rock, and the power of the rushing water - beautiful! Definitely check it out!\"One of many 'Must see's' in Jasper National park. The way the rageing river cuts through the narrow rock gorge to the calm emerald green lake below is a wonder to behold. The falls were partly frozen which added a new dimension. Add the stunning scenery and the picture is complete. We spent about an hour there as we happened to be passing but it was well worth the stop.\"Lovely place for a nice stroll, heard that its even more beautiful during summer and could get very crowded\"\"On our way home from an extra long weekend in Jasper we decided to stop and check it out. Was definitely worth the stop. Very impressive, a must see if you are in the area.\"\"Take the road closest to Jasper rather than just turning off the Parkway. It will take you a little longer but there's lots to look at on the way. The falls are beautiful, take the time to see them from all the viewing areas....and don't forget your camera\"If you are on your way to Jasper stop off at the Falls absolutely gorgeous and just a short walk from the car park... definitely a must see on route.\"Wonderful walk, short easy walk to the falls, you can choose to continue on, and walk the trail down to the lower river\"\"We visited Athabasca Falls at the beginning of April 2015. It's easy to find as it's on Icefield Parkway Highway 93. All the attractions on this highway have clear sign but when we see the sign it's quite near such place.The waterfall was nice but if we get there in summer, it should be more beautiful. Recommend to visit.\"\"Was easy to find, and lots of parking. Toilets were available.The walk was relatively flat with a few steps here and there. The view points were good. There are information boards along the route with good facts.\"\"We stopped at Athabasca falls to check it out, definetly worth the stop. Anyone and everyone that enjoys scenery will love this and really... everything around Jasper. We had an amazing trip. Looking forward to coming back to do lots of biking and hiking.\"\"One of our first stops on our road trip Jasper to Calgary, on fabulous Highway 93 - Icefields Parkway. A great waterfall, what beautiful scenery, wonderful experience, a must stop.\"I lived in Jasper for awhile and have been to athabasca falls many times. Summer and winter. Its free to enter although you have to pay to enter the park. Its well maintained with spectacular views! Lots of parking area too. The only down side is it gets very busy during peak season. Still worth checking out.This is just barely off the highway and worth the stop. The views are amazing and the trails are well maintained. Bring your camera!\"You should definitely stop here during your drive. It is a short walk to the falls to see the breathtaking beauty. A lot of the trail was icy, but you can still get to the falls and enjoy the scenery.\"\"These falls are always an amazing place to visit. Beside the falls the views of the canyon are stupendous, the walkways are slippery in winter so choose footwear with good grips.\"We visited in early April - roads on approach were clear and easily drivable. The actual waterfall was absolutely breath- taking! There is a clearly marked trail which was very save. It was a little icy - but the hand rails help to steady us!\"We visited at Easter. A little bit of snow and ice on the ground - if you're unsteady on your feet - it's not a good idea to venture beyond the main falls. The trail is not too intrusive, plenty of info boards and the path blends with the scenery. Our kids (8+5) loved this break from the highway and couldn't believe their eyes. Visit the falls and canyon beyond it. Incredible.\"The falls are easy access from the carpark and there was lots of water so falls were quite spectacular. There were a lots of steps down to a viewing area but the gradient meant it wasn't too bad getting back up again and I am very unfit so most mobile people should be able to cope with this. A must see sight to visit.\"Very fun place to take the kids to because it's loud and kids love waterfalls. Beautiful surrounding, well worth the stop.\"\"This is an often missed gem. I got the very best photos I have ever taken of waterfalls. You can get so close to this beautiful waterfall. Starting off flat at the top, you can walk down the stone steps, following the path that the force of the water has carved out over time. Many different vantage points for great photography. Gentle walk along the waters edge. Just brilliant. An absolute MUST SEE if in the Jasper area.\"\"Worth stopping by, nice and easy to locate, awesome view, stunning rock formation, beautiful in all season, great to see the falls - such heaven!\"\"Tours are closed to the falls in the winter, but hubby & I ventured out ourselves. Super easy to get to, 5 min walk from road, and totally worth it! Even when frozen they are still breathtaking.\"\"Awesome, try to check it out during the off season before june and after sept to avoid the large crowds and buses! Great place to see bears. Make sure you check the whole place out not just the first 5 minutes.\"\"another set of falls worth stopping for, they aren't too far off the highway and worth the few minutes for a walk around and experiencing\"\"This was our last stop before we went directly into Jasper for dinner.After all the amazing beauty of the Icefield Parkway, this powerful waterfall was well worth the 30 minutes of parking and walk to the outlook and bridge across the waterfall.It is a must stop and see - really not a lot of time needed to see an amazing natural beauty. The spray is continuous and its easy to get soaked depending on where you stand just from the powerful water coursing through and over so many areas of the rocks.\"We had a great time at the falls. It was a great stop after a long day of driving through the mountains. We walked around for an hour. I have never seen falls that big before. My teenagers enjoyed it too.Absolutely beautiful and breathe taking! Its amazing standing on the bridge in front of the falls and feeling the power of the falls! so cool! :)\"impressive falls and canyon. We try to take these in everytime we travel on 'The Icefields Parkway'. Also take in the Mountain Goat look out and Sunwapta Falls Lodge with a very good dining area. We also took in the Jasper Skywalk, absolutely awesome engineering.\"\"#1 - bring crampons I cannot stress this enough. I almost fell about 100 times, and I saw no fewer than two tourists destroy their cameras by slipping on the ice. #2- if you have been here during the summer you will find the falls are totally a different scene in the winter. They are majestic, and somehow frozen all the way through. It is really beautiful.\"\"It is approx 40 km from Jasper town site, travelling south on the road to Lake Louise.. The roads were clear and no ice or snow. The turnoff is well marked and the walk to the falls doesn't take very long. It was icy in spots so be careful . The walk to the falls is beautiful even in the winter time. It sure gives you a different perspective as to what nature can do when you see the frozen water. The parking lot is ploughed and there are outhouses. There is no cell phone service out here. Well worth the trip.\"\"What a wonderful place. We stopped in at the falls while in the Jasper area skiing at Marmot Basin. There was a lot of ice on the pathways, but with care we were able to get around to all the viewpoints. The falls looked really nice in the winter ice. Definitely worth the visit.\"Beautiful place to stop for a picnic and to gaze in amazement at what nature can do. Inspiring to just sit and watch for a while.\"Stunning water falls in Jasper! See the power of mountain water flowing through huge rocks and crevices! Enjoy the beautiful scenery of mountains, trees and breathe in the fresh mountain AIR!!!\"\"The falls were spectacular... viewing from above (near-level short walk from parking) and below using many stairs. Directly off highway. No charges. No food, etc.\"\"We always stop at the fall. It's never the same. Don't drive by!Bring something to eat and drink, but clean up after yourself. You are in bear countrySame for pets and kids! Keep an eye on them!\"Amazing viewing platform and great information posted around thefalls it is a must see on the way into jjasperWe saw it after the ice had melted so it was in full glory. Worth going to see but you need to walk down there to appreciate them. Mix with the Maligne Canyon walk\"Well signposted off Highway 93, and a short walk from the car park. Although the drop is not big by waterfall standards (23m drop), it is the amount of water that is forced into a narrow gap that makes for a spectacle of sight and sound.\"\"Beautiful falls. Shouldn't miss it because it is very close to Parkway, and a very short and easy trail hike. Nothing strenuous.\"The sounds of the water flowing and falling is enough to make Athabasca Falls a place to visit. The rock formations are huge!The rainbow you see is also a bonus. Our kids were amazed to see this marvel of nature that is the Athabasca Falls.\"Easy to find off of a map! Short trail! Beautiful scenery! We went here in the winter and it was breath taking so I can't even imagine in the summer! It was a nice small activity to enjoy, the falls were beautiful and the mountains superb as ever!! Really enjoyed coming here :)\"The Athabasca Falls is between Jasper and Lake Louise and Hwy #1 Hwy #93 crossing by. Amazing water Falls. Just have to walk there.\"You don't have to be there for long to get great views. The trail is short, but the falls are breathtaking.\"\"Very impressive waterfall with walking paths. the nice spots for taking photos are always filled with mist from the fall so a go-pro or something else waterproof you can quickly wipe down is the way to go. If you have a choice of time for the visit, early morning or later afternoon are best as during the day, this place can be super busy and you have to focus more on not to bump into people than the massive falls.\"Fabulous scenery. So dramatic! A must see. If you can fit it in it is not to be missed. Look for bears.\"We stopped at Athabasca Falls en route from Jasper to Lake Louise. A boardwalk takes you along the river from where the rapids begin to the thundering torrent that is the main attraction here. Along the way, you experience many vantage points and photo opportunities. Tour was by SunDog, excellent driver/commentator, nice clean little transport.\"Oh so beautiful. You take a walk down and just the size of the trees and the sound of the water gushing/rushing is so incredible.\"Really impressive don't miss it.Can get busy but walk along the tracks further up the falls and it's less busy\"\"we went as part of a snow mobile safari and stopped off here as part of the whole day trip, which included breakfast and a superb buffet dinner at the end, with coffee served from a huge enameled pot - just like in the westerns on TV.\"This thundering waterfall is amazing to see. Free to visit and just off the main Jasper-Banff road. Thousands of tonnes of water pouring through a narrow neck in the river. Worth a look!\"Spectacular waterfall viewing just off the Icefields Parkway, near Jasper. This small hiding trail is easily accessible for those who are not able to manage longer hikes. Definitely worth stopping and checking out.\"\"????????????????????????????????...The best time to watch this falls is during summer time.awesome falls!\"\"It a short walk to view the falls, however bring slip on cleats to put on your shoes as the path is quite icy.\"\"These falls were pretty intense! There was a lot of water coming down over them, and the canyon it has created was quite pretty!\"Important to see this. Spectacular and many nooks and crannies to explore. There is also a pleasant walk above the falls.I have been here many times and never get tired of it. Very popular place for tourists and tour buses so it can sometimes get a little crowded. Great location for photographs.\"Athabasca Falls is just one stop on the Icefield Parkway. A winding road stretching from Banff to Jasper. An amazing route thru the glaciers where you can get up close with these natural wonders. Take a walk up on a glacier, dip you hand in a fresh glacier fed stream. Some of these streams, including the one of the Athabasca Glacier collect and flow thru the Athabasca Falls. It is amazing to see. Dress warm, this water does not get warm even mid summer. A must see.\"\"The Athabasca Falls are definitely worth a stopover on the way to/from Jasper. It is amazing to see how the force of the water has carved thru solid rock to form the falls, and the canyon below.The trail is easy to negotiate and located not far from the car-park. It leads to various viewpoints and allows views from different aspects of the raging falls. If you choose to walk a little further into the trail, you will come to a viewpoint where you may be sprayed with water, depending on the time of year you visit.\"\"Plunging at a height of 23 metres, this powerful and picturesque waterfall is simply magnificent. Standing at different viewpoints, you can feel the strong force of nature with a close encounter of the loud roaring sound and the blue turquoise water splashing into the deep gorge.\"\"You drive up to an unassuming parking lot wondering if just beneath the surface lay something worth stopping here. You head up a paved trail and you find yourself greeted by one of Canada's most secretive treasures. In what seems like the middle of nowhere (unannounced by anything more than a modest sign that screams: \"\"There is absolutely nothing to see here\"\"), rests something wonderous that will have Christians and Evolutionists reheating the debate because what you will see is inexcusable! This kind of natural beauty can be captured on film and digital media, but to understand the true essence of it, you simply have to be there!\"\"Very lovely natural landmark. They've built in some excellent pathways that allow for different angle views of the falls, and that lets you get close enough to feel the spray and hear the roar.\"\"The blue/green river, the waterfalls and the mountains beyond were spectacular. There were several paths you could take to see the falls from different angles.\"This is a must see if you are the Icefields Highway. It's a nice way to take a quick break on the long road. The falls are a once in a life time visit and the glacier blue hue of the water is stunning.\"These falls were worth stopping at, powerful water lots of good photos. The glacial water was wonderful with rainbows & gushing water. Watch where you walk as it is dangerous\"\"Dont drive there just to see this. If it's on the way, you may spend some time. Nothing exceptional about it. You can find better places.\"a nice rest area with a nice waterfall. would be way better in the summer than in October after some hard frost but a nice walk around none the less.\"If you are a nature lover , this is one of the places to visit for colorful waters surrounded by rocky terrain\"It was a beautiful day and there are a lot of spots to take good photos of the falls and rushing water!We started our journey on the Parkway with our first stop at the falls. They were beautiful and the power they have is amazing. We were there early and beat the tour buses to the site. There were a lot of people visiting but they have several spots to view them and see the power of the water on the rocks around them. This is a stop you must make.\"All around here is stunning, you could some it up as trees, water and mountains, but that would not give credence to the awesome views.\"\"We went in November and it had just snowed! It's not a gigantic fall but with the snow it was so lovely. The water was actually turquoise too.There are alot of paths around.\"\"We visited the falls very early in the morning as the sun was rising, and would definitely recommend going at that time - the falls are absolutely stunning and we got some amazing photos. Very accessible from the car park and well worth a visit.\"\"After you've seen the falls, look at the size of the river upstream or downstream and try to imagine all the water going through the narrow waterfall\"A spectacular falls which is easily accessible from the carpark. Lots of water rushing over the boulders and down into the valley.\"Close to the main highway, these falls are awesome, especially as they seem to burrow into the stone below. Lots of places to take a good photo and the glacial water makes all look extra beautiful.\"\"It's a lovely full-bodied waterfall, mini-Niagara. It is easily accessible for great views, and there is an option to descend to the bottom of the fall through amazing rock formations that look surreal.\"\"very powerful waterfall, even at the end of Sept. Can only imagine what it's like in May with the spring runoff\"\"Very pretty falls, offering some walking trails down to the river as well as the main falls themselves\"\"Yes indeed, this is worth stopping for. Lovely lake and amazing mountains are the backdrop for an really powerful waterfall. Lots of different viewing platforms with interesting stories relating to the falls.\"A breathtaking view of waterfalls and the sounds of nature This is a major stopping point for most tours and for a very good reason.A truly spectacular photo stopYet another beautiful scenic experience well worth another bus break.different view points to capture the most of this waterfall . We were so lucky with weather.although a popular tourist attraction worth the crowd - most are accommodating when needing a photograph!!\"Definitely is a must to stop by. Beautiful waterfalls but the best time to go when its quieter and less people, then it makes much more special and place to visit. Great spot for photography. Highly recommend it.\"\"Be sure to walk all around to get all perspectives - very beautiful. If you see a lot of buses in the parking lot, try to change when you go to view - gets very crowded at the best view spots\"Easy parking and well signposted walks along the falls. Care needed as paths can be slippery. Beautiful and a 'must visit' site in the Rockies!\"A nice falls which are easy to access from the highway. It really only takes a few minutes to see the falls. This area, however, does see a lot of tour bus and general traffic. If you stop, you will encounter a large number of people. If your looking for a peaceful, little spot near Athabasca Falls try Honeymoon Lake. My favorite spot in Jasper National Park is the Mount Lady Cavell area. It's located about 30 minutes or so from Athabasca Falls. If you have a little time, you may wish to take the scenic route to Jasper down Highway 93 A. You'll leave a lot of traffic behind and there's some nice scenery along the way. Also, Mount Lady Cavell is located just off 93A.\"Our tour bus briefly stopped here. It was a little disappointing if you have seen numerous waterfalls in the past. This is more about the volume of water going over the falls than how the falls look. If you're strapped for time give it a miss.Yet another beautiful 'must see' site in the Rockies.Make sure you see all of it and cross under the road. Mother Nature at her very best.\"The falls are nice and, because they’re right off the highway, are definitely worth a look. However, depending on the day and time, you could run into a lot of people packed into a tight little viewing area.By all means, get up close to the falls and get your pictures and all that. But also make some time to stroll on the worn paths alongside the Athabasca River. You’ll get away from the crowds and the scenery is unreal: the glittering river rolling toward the falls, with the sharp peaks close on the horizon.If you have a half hour to spend here, I’d recommend taking five minutes to snap a few shots of the falls, and spend the rest of the time walking along the river. For me, the falls was the appetizer and the stroll along the water was the main course.\"\"Visited the falls in September 2014, easy access to see the falls for the disabled, beautiful scenery.\"\"A great stopping place with falls, rivers and walkways. Well worth a stop and good photo opportunities.\"\"Stopped to view falls when driving between Jasper and Banff and were pleased we did. Located very close to the main road they provided a pretty spectacular sight, especially as the waters had not really been flowing very strongly in many other locations the strength and power of the falls was very impressive.Well worth breaking your journey to see.\"Driving between Lake louise and Jasper is arguably the best drive in the world with OMG moments all along the Icefield Pathway. The Athabasca falls is another of these moments. Very glad we spent time visiting all these great places including Athabasca Falls- don't miss itWe decided to stop and check this out. Sooooo glad we did. Words and pictures cannot describe how beautifully magnificent these falls are.\"Lovely walk beside this roaring, powerful river. I enjoyed walking down the steps in the old canyon, and seeing the rock formations on the canyon walls.\"\"Stopped off to visit Athabasca Falls (30kms from Jasper), just off the HWY and well worth seeing. They are not too spectacular but they just take a minutes to get there from the motorway. The entire area is quite scenic.\"Easy to get in and out so definitely stop here. Free parking in the lost and very well marked trails for different perspectives.\"The parkway seems to go on forever and there are so many great sights to see, so it is tempting to pass a few bay. But I recommend you dont miss this very pleasant stroll to see the lake and the falls. I was just looking at my videos and photos from my canada trip last year and remembering how lovely the falls were to visit. Especially when you have been driving a lot in the car. It is great to get out and stretch your legs in this lovely area. Just a short stroll from the car park the walk ways are well kept and there is easy access to walk around the falls and see the lake. Great views of the falls and signs with pictures and information let you know lots of information about the flora and fauna. The wildlife is never far away. We were able to sit and watch a squirrel as he sat on a branch in perfect Tufty poise with his tail curled up his back.\"It's very beautiful. The glacial blue water in the summer is of extreme beauty. Can spend hours on a bench just listening to the rush of the waters or walking down only 100 meters to the calm end of the fall\"Kind of busy with the bus tours and all, but worth a stop on the way to or from somewhere. Stroll along the path to get away from the camera commandos and high heel and bear bell crowd.\"\"We did a tour from jasper, with sundog. The guide was very good, just enough information without overload. The falls are beautiful. Worth the walk don't forget your camera.\"A delightful stop! Beautiful view of waterfalls and potholes that the rushing water makes. Aqua water falls off like an infinity pool...a really amazing experience and walkway....definitely a must! A highlight of the Jasper area.Great falls and many good viewing platforms. Get there early if possible so you keep ahead of all the bus loads.We just happened to pull into to Falls while traveling from Jasper to Banff. We are so glad we did! There are lots of easy foot paths to walk on. You can easily get to various points of the falls. There are lots of informative signs. Take a few minutes to walk down through the rocks where the river used to flow.Just beautiful. Make sure you walk down to the lower canyon. You can walk right up to the waters edge. Gorgeous views there!A short hike from the parking lot will take you to the falls. Great viewing locations of the falls and surrounding mountains.Nothing to dislike about this site well may be the toilets are primitive. The falls are amazing and very photogenic!\"This is a stunning waterfall even when the river level is low, but not the best in the area. Alao be sure to go to maligne canyon and Sunwapta falls which is just further down on the Icefields Parkway be sure to go to the upper and lower falls..\"An impressive amount of water over the falls even tho' it was at the end of summer. A free attraction and we walked all around the falls and in the gullies for about 3/4 of an hour.\"We had a quick stop here, but it was long enough for a photo. There were toilets too, but not much else.\"We visited these falls while we were staying in Jasper and loved them. We would definitely recommend a visit as they are stunning and probably even more stunning in the spring when the snow is melting and adding to the volume of water passing over them.\"Took a guided tour of the ice fields, fantastic experience and top class information from our guide, a must do experience especially if you are interested in the environment and effects of Globalisation.\"\"One of don't miss sights along the Icefields Parkway, a little outside of Jasper. The paths are all paved and you can view the falls from both sides. It isn't a particular \"\"big\"\" waterfall, but a forceful one as can be witnessed by the carved out rock.\"\"Best waterfalls I have ever seen, very calm and soothing, well worth the trip and little walk/hike. Loved the chance to be able to walk down to the river and feel the cold blue/green water, very beautiful\"I enjoyed a quick stop at this falls. It was near the parking lot and well worth a stop to see the falls and canyon.Well worth a visit. Major photo opportunity and well managed site with amenities. Just a nice place to hang out and spend some tie watching the World go by.\"Having had many deaths over the years at these falls the authorities have been very sympathetic in applying health and safety at the site. True the railing do detract from the natural beauty and sort of shepherd you around but when the rivers in full flood then these falls are not only spectacular but also frightening for the faint of heart.That said, we were mesmerised by the beauty and the sheer power of the water as it made its was from a gentle undulating flow to a destructive torrent in about twenty feet.There is a full walkway that allows you to see the first part of the falls from both sides and they are simply stunning. For those more adventurous there are steps that take you all the way down to the river basin with a few off-shoots along the way - the majority of it all is extremely photogenic and I would whole heartedly recommend it to everyone in the area.\"\"If you're in the area, travelling along the Icefields Parkway, then a stop off at the Athabasca falls is a good idea. There is no entrance fee, and plenty of free parking. Access is very good on foot, and the falls themselves are interesting to see: there is an old dry section where the river has diverted naturally, and the effects of the water flow on the rock formations are clearly visible.\"\"A short stop for those either in or out of Jasper. Right off the hwy. This isn't a hike as all the paths are paved and easily accessible. Some of the views at the bottom as the lake trails off into the distance is breathtaking. The waterfall is beautiful, if perhaps a little \"\"touristy\"\", but with that allows families and everyone to enjoy the magnificence that is the Rockies in a safe environment. Recommend.\"Fences line the whole route. For good reason as have been a number of deaths but feel it has taken away the naturalness of the area. Good sight but better in the area.\"A free place to visit just 30km out of Jasper down the Icefields Parkway. Definitely worth a stop. Not a \"\"big\"\" fall but its design is interesting and the platforms allow you to get very close. A worthwhile 30-minute stop.\"Thundering water and just off the highway and well worth the stop. Walk across the bridge to the other side for the best views.Beautiful water falls set in spectacular scenery. A short stroll around to see some fabulous geology.We had a lovely walk to the falls and read all the information supplied on the boards in the area. Would have liked to have stayed longer but we were with a group on a coach and so had to be back at a certain time.\"we did this hike and loved it even though the weather was rainy and on the cool side. it was crowed, but we were there over a holiday wk end. Since it is spread out, I didn't think it was overly crowded, BUT others did.\"\"A beautiful experience, awe inspiring. We always go back here when we are in the area. Well worth the drive.\"Just a short walk from the carpark and good stop off point on your trip along the spectacular Icefields Parkway near to Jasper.\"Easy to find, clean toilet facilities for travellers and the most stunning waterfall. I would tread carefully following rain as the steps could become quite slippery.\"\"Loved Athabasca Falls. We were there on Labour day so it was a bit crowded but with patience, you could get a good view and take lots of pictures.There were also lots of washroom facilities available. Would have been a nice spot to stop for a picnic.\"The falls were not far from Jasper. They were an easy walk to get to as well. Every view of the falls was another photo opportunityVery nice set of waterfalls. A couple short trails to see the upper and lower falls. Interesting lookouts over the falls. plenty of parking\"As a friend said; touristy but worth it, Large fast flowing falls just near the car park. Just have to hope you manage to avoid the tourist busses.\"\"Excellent. There is a nice walking trail, so allow some time for that. Series of bridges, deep gorge, impressive.\"\"We pulled off the road on a whim after we saw the waterfall sign. What a find! We stayed over an hour exploring, walking the many trails, and taking tens of great pictures. And, it's free! Wear good shoes for the walking and make a point to know where you are (and where you left your car!) We got disoriented a couple of times with the many winding trails. A truly gorgeous falls and close-up water views are amazing!\"\"The low clouds, light drizzle, sound of the roaring falls all made for a spectacular experience. Not to be missed.\"These falls although not high are fantastic. The roar caused by the water winding its way through the rocks is incredible. They are on the main route between Banff and Jasper and should not be missed.Impresive. Very impresive. Grat place to hike and many photo opportunities. Great paths between huge rocks. Easy accessible. Well worth to visit. Free car park.What's not to like about gushing water over age old rocks and into deep canyons. Beautiful scenery and well worth a visit.\"We stopped as part of a group so time was limited, a definite drawback. An early experience of the Rockies. The power of water over the years opens up a fantastic spectacle which is worthwhile taking a bit of time. Watch your footing.\"Most impressive to see and hear the power of the water which has sculpted the rock over the eons. Fortunately we were there when there were not too many people. Judging by the large parking lot it could get mighty crowded. Off season on a rainy day was perfect.We enjoyed walking along the edge of the river to the Falls and the Falls overlooks. It is beautiful.Getting to this location is an easy walk - rewarded by a gorgeous falls. Don't miss this turn off on the Ice Fields Parkway.\"This waterfall is very accessible, plenty of parking, and always provides excellent photo opportunities.\"\"An absolute must do, great experience, you are driven out onto the glacier in Big Cats, and given quite a bit of information by the driver on the way to the glacier\"Went here to take pictures. You need to try and get there either in the morning or anytime when it is cloudy. The tour buses make the place crowded. Great place for pictures.\"On our last day in Jasper area we took the drive out to Athabasca Falls. We had seen it before but are always in awe of the power of water in carving out rocks to form a channel. Walk was relatively easy even though it was drizzling a bit that day. Lots of good photo opportunities. We did, though, see some very stupid young males climb over the safety fence and stand out on the rocks. Attention getting? I'm sure they didn't see anything more than we did.\"\"What a wonderful experience, Fred our driver from Sundog Tours took us on an amazing journey to see this natural sight. Would recommend this to everyone visiting the area, it's not to be missed\"Pretty as a picture. Very easy access to the falls. Worth going to.............. Nothing more to sayloved to hear the rush of water and feel the spray. Lots of tourists. Really there was nothing we disliked as there was lots of parkingThe falls and the location are fabulous for a walk and sightseeing water and nature at their prime. Easy access and relatively flat walking if only the upper falls are going to be viewed\"Brilliant waterfall and then some! More and more waterfalls as river continues through ravine to lake beyond. Interesting walk down to lake through path of ancient river canyon. Interesting rock formations, plenty to see and photograph. Easy reach from carpark.\"Wear your waterproof. Lots of spray and lots of other tourists all doing the same thing. More like a giant plug hole than a waterfall. But worth the stopTruly amazing natural experience that took many thousands of years for nature to carve out of the stone and rock. The walk around offers many photo ops. DO take time to see this one.This is no Niagara but is a beautiful place. Make sure to take the short walk on the right hand side of the road opposite the falls. Stunning scenery and unreal colours\"Rushing water, great viewpoints, easy walk to get there. It was impressive even on a rainy, cold day. Lots of tourists vying for good camera shots.\"\"Although we visited in late summer, there was still enough water to be very impressive. The walk was easy & interesting. A must stop.\"Beautiful walks and wonderful photo opportunities! As with everything in the Rockies during the height of summer - go early to avoid the crowds and enjoy the peace!\"Gorgeous scenery, potholes, historic information along a beautifully man made path. Walk along the river to the falls, down to the potholes and through the old river where the rock won! Wonderful, picturesque stop toward Jasper.\"\"The falls were simply awesome and amazing! However, the bathrooms were dirty, smelly enough to choke a horse. The hand sanitizer was empty and we were very disappointed especially having to pay a fee to enter Jasper. One would think that the fees would also include regular maintenance of the washrooms.\"Athabasca Falls are one of those must sees when travelling thru Jasper National Park. It is not far down Highway 93 and worth a stop.Absolutely breathtaking. After paying $25 and being disappointed with the Skywalk we stumbled across the Athabasca Falls. It's beautiful and free!\"well worth the stop! It is a amazing and beautiful waterfall and the way it cut through rock is breathtaking. The only thing I can say is for a Thursday afternoon, it was FULL and hard to get around with all the tourists. I figured the middle of September and the middle of the week it wouldn't be quite so crowded. I was wrong...but it was still worth the stop\"\"Outside the town of Jasper but well worth the drive. Great place to go regardless of age. Good walking sidewalks, with rails. Some stairs. Great views.\"They look small when compared to some other falls. But once you see them you are in awe of them. Very close to the parking lot. The view from each angle is different. One has to go to all the possible view points to watch. Seeing this fall from so close relaxes the mind and gives a pleasant feeling.A worth place to visit.This is a must stop to see. It is just a few steps before you see this gorgeous spot! Walk up and down on both sides so you can see the falls and where they go as the water flows into a beautiful pool and river!\"Great little falls right off the highway. Nice paths to walk on, and wheelchair accessible. Definitely take the time to walk around the falls. The path takes you right near the edge where the water drops.\"\"This is a must stop, falls are beautiful and nice trails well done to walk around, easy to spend an hour here. there is really a lot to see. we were here in Sept and it was flowing really good with blue water, I cant imagine what it is like when the snow is melting in the spring. Make the stop\"The waterfall is easily accessible and impressive. You must go to both sides of it to enjoy all its beauty\"This waterfall is worth a short walk. Having seen numerous falls in BC, I liked the layout and pathways provided to explore Athabasca. Wish we went whitewater-rafting though!!\"You HAVE to stop -- if you are passing -- but there are lots of amazing waterfalls in Canada - things one is easily accessible form the main road\"The proof of the phenomenal power of water is amazing!There are a few stairs but could be fun for the whole family! Fantastic views of the falls and mountains!\"\"Just like any other falls in the Rocky Mountains, they are beautiful! The scenery is worth seeing and very accessible to everyone as they are a very short walk from the parking area!!\"The only negative thing was the wet weather we picked in May 2013. But the views and majesty of all those thousands of tony cascading down the falls was breath taking\"The falls are a very short stroll from the parking lot, which makes them accessible for almost everyone. There are a few stairs, however, that I don't think you can get around. It doesn't take long to stop, and the falls are worth seeing, but be prepared for a crowd.\"\"When you pull into the parking area at Athabasa Falls, it doesn't look like much. Just a shallow, r rippling river... but you can hear the roar of the water, and that draws you along to the walkway and on to the bridge crossing the raging, beautiful falls. There are many paths, signage bearing interesting facts about the area, a tonne of photo opportunities.Don't miss the lower tunnel, where the river once ran. It's labelled the Time Tunnel, and the rock formations are amazing. Continue on around the bend to the right for a stunning view of the now-calm waters of the lower river. If you are only planning to travel as far as Jasper, this is definitely worth the extra drive!Note: We were there at sunset, very few people around, a gorgeous sunset added to the ambiance!\"\"The trail is easy, not much elevation, people of all ages can do it easily. It has some stairs( sometimes slippery), so stroller carriers, think before you carry it. The igneous rocks have been cut by the falls water, and that looks great. It could take 1-2 hours easily if you do the entire loop.\"\"we stopped on route from Canmore to Jasper and the falls were well worth a visit. Beautiful scenery and not a difficult walk. although Sept still coach parties around so I am not sure how busy it would be in high season, but still worth visiting\"\"Waterfalls and water in general is as hypnotic and tranquil as fire to us crazy human types so no wonder we all love seeing water come crashing thru rock channels and pooling up before dropping again. We walk through these trails and lose track of time as we're hypnotized as we stare at the raw beauty of water...showing rock whose the boss...lolBeautiful, free to all, and kids will love all the climbing and jumping...don't miss it\"This is the second time seeing this and it was well worth a repeat visit. The scenery is magnificent\"It gets very crowded here so be prepared. Pretty little falls. Make sure you walk down to the water and see the canyon. It's a short steep walk, but you get a different perspective.\"It is a beautiful sight for all the senses. A don't miss is the short trek through the lower end to a lake and lookout. Beautiful pictures. You could climb up and just take in the beauty of the Canadian Rockies\"The Falls are very pretty adn the hike there and back is quite enjoyable. with some bends, curves, and switchbacks along the way.\"\"A must see on any trip around Jasper. Like elsewhere within the park, informative signs, well marked trails and routes.\"Good walking tours follow river and falls with various outlooks for picture taking. Geology and mountain vistas.The canyon the the falls runs into is as inspiring as the falls. The walk to the falls is short and easy.A must for all visitors..... Useful information boards explained what you were seeing and why.....just fantastic!\"The other reviews are spot on, this is a can't miss spot. There is a very short walk, not hike, on pavement, to the perfect spot. Just do it.\"\"This was a great stop on our first day travelling to Jasper. The falls were beautiful. There is a nice walking area around the falls and down to the river, lots of Photo opps.\"\"During the busy Labor Day weekend, this was the only place where we felt claustrophobic (in our days visiting Banff, Jasper, Lake Louise, Icefield Parkway over the days during and around the weekend). People were shoving, rude and it was really hard to enjoy the beautiful waterfall!\"There are levels of walking for everyone - near or farther. Some rough spots. Such a beautiful spot!We have been here several time before so it has become a regular when showing off to visitors. The falls are stupendous. So much power and nice easy walks.\"Absolute must see!! Words cannot express the power of these falls. I was very impressed with the greatwalks and viewpoints and informational plaques. I have been here many times and am always amazed.\"\"This is a definite must see for anyone who is traveling between Jasper and Banff Alberta. The toilets are outhouses and although as clean as an outhouse can be, still smelly. Concrete walkways and bridges make for easy access for able-bodied people. Unfortunately there are steps that would prevent wheelchairs accessing the beautiful views. Set aside at least 45 minutes to an hour just for a quick look around. On the occasion of our visit there was a Parks Canada staff member with information setup about various animals, and she was showing animal pelts [I am sure these animals were not killed by Parks Canada staff solely for demonstration purposes]. I have never had the opportunity before to see the size and feel the fur of these various animals. It was a very positive experience. There is no gift shop or any other trappings. I believe Parks Canada has tried to keep this beautiful spot as pristine as possible given the large number of tourists that come by every year.\"\"You must stop here, you won't regret it. Amazing little place with a huge wow factor!! The power of these falls is awesome. Can get a little crowded so I would get there in the morning.\"\"worth the stop, river flowing into falls and canyon below. Nice tourist area right off main highway to view fall, with outdoor facilities\"Sheets of spray billow off the milky white water plunging over the falls into the narrow gorge. There are several points on the paved path to get great views and pictures. All this just a short walk from the car park.\"Excellent well worth a visit, get there early as parking can be quite limited and it is very busy at times, the falls are spectacular so don't forget the camera.\"\"Try the Rafting Adventures - it's great fun and good for all the family, from 6 years old. Safe but exciting!\"\"The falls are situated in approximately 30 kilometers of Jasper. The site is charming, the debit of water is impressive. The arrangement is easily accessible and walks very well in a fitted out path. To see absolutely. There is however a lot of people.\"\"At first sight they looked disappointing, but further in the falls were absolutely breathtaking. Not just the falls, but the carved out rock they have created over the years\"\",\"Athabasca Fall is right by the highway. From the parking lot we did not need to walk much to reach the fall. It was nice walking around the fall and canyon.\"This is great, give yourself some time to really walk around, it's well worth 45 minutes, there's not just the falls, but the canyons, pot holes and the serene lake\"Beautiful location but extremely crowded if you get caught up with the organised travel groups. Make sure you get their early or later in the day when the tour buses have moved on.One of the many sights along the Icefields Parkway and worth the stop. Nicely presented and maintained by the Parks authority.\"Athabasca Falls, by far, is one of my favorite spots in Jasper National Park. The beauty just surrounds you from all sides. It's a must see for sure!\"The falls were absolutely breathtakingly powerful ....you can also take a walk along the river ......going down through the rocks there isn't that much to see - so avoid if you have issues with mobility - but Definately take a walk over the bridge to experience the power of the falls - feels like it's rainingAwesomeness. Great for a stop to stretch the legs. Very pleased and very scenic. Great photo opportunity. A few trails around to explore. Toilets. Picnic areas.\"What can you say about something like this, it amazes me every time I go there, following the trail gets you to more views and more falls!! it is nice and it is close to Jasper.\"\"Even in winter, with frozen water, this fall is a sight to see. Great photo op and paved track so can be accessed even in winter.\"nice break to take a walk and a few pictures. Amazing how much water has passed over the rocks and carved out its path.\"A great sight, even if you've seen a waterfall before, this one has it's own unique features. The best part is probably the small hike down to the river bottom where the falls calm, so tranquil and beautiful. There tend to be a ton of people at the falls, it's nice to take a few steps away and get away from the crowd down below.\"I didnt expect to see such a big water fall in Alberta! Definitely must see for any nature lovers. When we were there it was pretty gloomy and raining but we still had a good time\"It was quite crowded when we arrived and had to wait for a few people to move before we could get pictures without strangers in them . The falls are pretty but make sure you cross the pedestrian bridge and follow the trail to the right , under the road's bridge . You walk thru a small abandoned canyon and there is a fork in the trail . To the left leads down to the river's edge . To the right takes you to a beautiful overlook of the river leveling out and a beautiful rock escarpment . Nature has really worked it's magic here with the beautiful contrast of colors between the rock and the silty river .  Everyone has their own interests but I literally would stop here again just for this view .\"\"I loved this gem! Amazing scenery that can take your breath away. I will be coming back every year! A must-see. Great, light walking for someone like me with a double knee injury; the paths are easy to walk and perfect for families.\"\"Wonderful to look at and enjoy, there are various viewing points you can walk to. Really enjoyed this place.\"\"you have to walk on stairs but it is worth it.Make sure to reach the other side of the falls.You will get wet but the view is well worth it.Do go down to the lower canyon.\"I've been here many times and in many different seasons but am always delighted by these beautiful falls. Usually quite crowded in summer time but worth the stop; can easily spend 30 minutes here crossing the falls and going down the path to the base of the falls.\"Nice waterfalls, but a waterfall is just a waterfall.Stop, look, take a picture and move on to the better stuff!\"\"Although less popular than Sunwapta Falls, Athabasca Falls was quite beautiful to see. Wider than some other falls, it is a nice stop while driving to Jasper or Banff.\"\"The place is spectacular, with a fantastic view over gorges and fall. We hear very well the current of the river to bounce on cliffs. Is worth seeing. There is however a great deal of tourists, often incapable to wait and which put themselves in your way at any time to be photographed.\"\"A waterfall viewed from the top. Only a short, easy walk from the car park. An unusual view and one not to miss.\"\"Wow the water flows thru here fast, you must make a stop to check this out. The amount of water travelling thru the rocks with such force was incredible to watch and a great walk thru the rocks down to see where it all ends up in the lake. You only need a half hour stop to check it out and it is worth it.\"Only a short walk from the car the falls are spectacular. Although popular they have real atmosphere and well worth doing the trackes around and about to make the most of them.\"The falls were fantastic to view, the history and beauty are something to really take in. Walking along the falls is a really great experience and good exercise as you climb the stairs\"\"Easy walking trails lead to serveral vantage points of these spectacular falls. Stand on the trails below the falls and feel the cool mist, great on a hot day (be sure to cover your lens)\"\"The sounds alone will astonish you! Water currents and geological erosion come to a head here when you stand before the awesome energy of Athabasca Falls. Though the cascade is not as vertically pleasing as most falls, the power and flow-width of this direction change and drop in elevation of the river makes you aware of it's displayed, ever present energy. Stopping to hear and feel the mist on your cheeks is worth every minute.\"\"If you are in the Jasper area, be sure to take the time to go to the Athabasca Falls. It is a beautiful natural area where you could spend much time just soaking in nature's bounty.\"\"I liked the informative notices that Parks Canada has posted there, explaining how the falls are receding up the river over time. It is a great spot for photos, as we say a rainbow over the falls.\"The park service did an excellent job with the many interesting viewpoints of these beautiful falls. Very much worth the stop.\"Certainly worth the stop, but it was very busy when we were there.. I think there were 3 busses in the parking lot. I picked up a bag of garbage that someone had just dropped in the middle of the path and put in the garbage bin only 50ft away... how can some people be so ignorant?\"\"Athabasca Falls has to be seen. Impressive. Visit both sides. Take your time. Maybe the right side is more impressive, you could reach the border of the falls\"Was a lovely spot to view the force of the river and falls. Great nature lover pictures. A short distance from the highway and well worth the stop to see the canyons and falls in the river.\"This is more than a waterfall. Take the time to walk all the way down and around to the bottom Look at the walls, potholes, the little alpine gardens, and of course the rushing water below you. This is a waterfall to be appreciated up close, and slow enough to appreciate some of the finer points. There are plenty of informational boards to help explain this unique place.\"We hit up the Athabasca falls after decided to drive through the parks on our way from Golden to Edmonton - glad we did. The falls themselves were just breathtaking but I was also impressed by the trails around the falls - nice to be able to walk down the old path of the falls etc.Another spectacular natural wonder in these great parks. Quite the falls and rock formations. Don' t drive by - stop and see these falls. As always if you want to see them without the crowds come very early in the day and you won't have to elbow anyone out of your photo spot.\"Best falls in Jasper, hands down. Spectacular and so powerful! Well worth the stop and short walk to get right next to the falls. DO NOT MISS THIS!\"This is a must if you are travelling from Jasper to Banff. It is a quick jaunt off of the highway and is just beautiful! Definately worth stopping for a bit and enjoying the sights!\"This is a beautiful stop on the drive from Banff to Jasper and even better because it is free. Nice bridges and walking paths with very safe railings allow you to see the falls from many angles. This falls is fairly high, but more of an attraction because of the volume of water going over. Easy walk for those with limited mobility to see parts of it - a few stairs to get to other viewpoints.\"It's a spectacular waterfall. There are several spots from which to admire its beauty. Easy access. Don't miss it.\"Stopped here on the way to Banff. The Falls are amazing. So much water. When we were there, there was a stunning rainbow above the Falls. It woudl be a crime to be in the area and not stop here IMO.\"\"As all of the other reviews have stated, these falls are exceptional! You can spend a long time just looking at them in awe! Definitely worth a visit.\"It is amazing that the rocks survive the constant pounding of the water. Really worth seeing. Easy trail and steps to see the falls top to bottomI could have spent hours at these falls. Very easy access right off the Icefields Parkway. Guiding paths allowed viewing from all angles. Definitely a place to visit.\"Make sure you stop and see this, so beautiful. Lots of tourists but its normal as its so beautiful. I stop here when ever I am in that area.\"\"The Canadians love their parks and can be legitimately proud of Athabasca Falls. It is easly accessible and because of bridges, you can see the falls from many vantage points. This is a \"\"don't miss\"\" if you are in the vicinity of Jasper\"From a gentle surface to the canyon formed by the falls shows the power of nature. Short treks can also take you up and downstream a bit for further viewsThe falls were amazing. The color of the water is beautiful. We just stayed and watched the great gushing of water and enjoyed it so much. A relaxing break from a hectic trip!\"...you could elude the ever-present overcrowding. Face it, anyone who visits Banff/Jasper/Yoho/Kootenay all visit nearly the same time of year. The crowds in the well-known areas are going to be overwhelming. I still have to say, though, it most definitely interferes with your ability to absorb what otherwise on an uncrowded day would be a lifetime experience.That being said, the falls are beautiful. Parks Canada has carved out a beautiful path to view and to descend to the beach, where you are able to depart on a white water rafting expedition. The falls would be an incredible experience if you could enjoy them in a less-crowded setting. My suggestion would be to try to get here very early and see if the experience is different.Parks Canada has also done a great job with the placement of informative markers so you can read the historic elements of the falls. I simply wish I enjoyed viewing things with 1000 of my best friends.\"Good for a quick stop. 15 minute viewing of falls so close to the road. Big parking lot. Buses will be there about 8.30 so leave Jasper before 8 to be ahead of the crowds\"We & our kids enjoyed being able to see & feel the falls as well as explore around the area. It was beautiful. FYI though, this is not stroller or wheel chair friendly.\"\"Not just another falls, very impressive to see and hike around. Wish we had more time to do the trail down to lower view. Saddest part was seeing memorials to young people who didn't stay on trail, and were lost down the falls. Watch the kiddos! And hope you don't mind using park pit toilets\"The power and force of water is visually displayed at these beautiful water falls. The water carves through the canyon. It gives one pause and demonstrates power.\"http://www.jasper.travel/content/athabasca-fallsDon't pass this by. It doesn't look like much from the road, but has several vantage points for spectacular views of the waterfall and the interesting erosion patterns. I found it to be one of the best waterfalls I have seen due to the surrounding scenery and erosion than for the falls.There are boardwalks, decks, concrete and stone steps, and paved rams on which to walk to view the falls from different vantage points. Be sure to walk around the corner at the old falls to get the full effect. There are a lot of steps, perhaps 100 altogether, so be prepared to be tired if you are not accustomed to steps/stairs and altitude. You cannot negotiate strollers except at the very beginning. Some of the steps and walkways are wet, so I would recommend good walking shoes with rubber soles rather than heels or flip-flops.My bus tour was only there for 30 minutes, so I had to hurry to go to the end and back in that time. If you are on your own with no time constraints, I would allow about an hour here. It is quite crowded, but the photo ops are splendid.\"The falls are beautiful and very easily accessed. The walkways allow visitors to experience the falls (and their power) from several different vantage points. Very cool.\"By all means, this is worth the time to pull over and explore. We walked the entire boardwalk and were blown away by the volume of water and forces created. The mist in the air made for fantastic photographs. Highly recommend it. You won't be disappointed.\"\"These falls are close to the highway and so are worth a stop off during your drive up or down the Icefield Parkway. We spent 35 minutes here, walking to see the falls from the different angles possible, and taking pictures but you could have easily spent longer as we were very quick. Whilst we saw many different falls on our trip, I would definitely recommend stopping here. As others have said, here you see the awesome power of God and his creation. It's just amazing to stand and watch the power of the water. Truly amazing - a wide, calm river and the power it has on the rock as it falls. It's interesting to walk down the passageway to see the canyon and river below. Where you walk, is what once was a passageway for the water, a long time ago and you can see where the water has carved patterns in the rock over time.\"Just a short hike from the parking lot takes you to a thundering waterfall (more like a really big dangerous rapid) and a deep cut gorge. Just off the Icefields Parkway south of Jasper.\"The falls are easy to access, which accounts for its suffocating crowds. I guess I would rather hike to a less crowded waterfall. Otherwise, it is one amazing, majestic sight as the river cascades lower.\"This is a must see stop. Its not a long walk at all and well worth it if it was. It shows the awesome power of God and his creation.\"Athabasca falls is certainly a MUST while visiting Jasper National Park.the main falls are close to the road, but if you wish to enjoy the full experience, take the short well-maintained trail to the bottom of the little canyon, where the falls open up into the river.The sheer power of the water thundering down the falls is very impressive.The water-carved walls in the little canyon created by the falls are beautiful to walk through.A great experience for the whole family.We loved it!! So will you!!!Don't Miss It!!\"A very short walk from the car park to a stunning set of waterfalls and a great example of the forces of nature at work as cuts through a deep canyon to the floor below\"This is probably one of the most impressive, definitely in terms of its water force. Just a short walk, and you get to look at it from different angles. You even get to feel it as it sprays over the viewers platform. Wonderful.\"\"This was a beautiful stop. Short and very easy. Handicap accessible for a good portion of it. The part that is not handicap accessible is a very easy path to hike. The falls here are lovely, great picture spot! Many visitors stop here, it can be very crowded.\"Athabasca Falls is one of the must do stops in the Jasper area. It is a nice walk with lots of water. We say so many falls in Alberta and this was one of the good ones and worth a stop.The sheer power & force of the water flowing as it wends its way down from the top of the falls is an incredible sight! The vegetation & rock wall formations that harness the sideways flow having been worn away by the water have a strength of their own ! A must see when in the area.\"What a great walk to see what water can etch into a landscape. The path is easy and safe, the photo ops are brilliant. Well worth a peek.\"Amazing falls but I guess it has to be enjoyed by all. And I mean all! If you are lucky enough to visit between tour busses! The best time is probably early evening and when the weather is a little cool. Yes a must to see in Jasper!\"This is some kind of a fall, big, noisy and showing itself from all sides, with even a sport to refresh yourselve in the spray. Very interesting also because you can walk an old arm where the water left and see what it did to the rock. It ends down where the falls end up in the river, quite a nice spot.\"COOL AND REFRESHING with the spray in your face and so beautiful for photography. My fave place in Jasper definitely\"Enjoyed thoroughly the sound of the fall, cool air and majestic falling for water. Makes me wonder why man thinks they can be God? The fall was so magnificent.\"We stopped off when driving down the Icefields parkway. It was a good stop with some great views and with not much walking involved a good way to break up the journyThe falls are quite lovely and interesting. Be sure to walk around so you can view the falls and associated canyon from different directions. Excellent photo opportunities. Not a place to scramble around but very much worth seeing. Look for cross bedding in the sandstone all around and amongst the falls.\"We took the 1st road to the falls which is actually the longest road to the falls, but the scenery is worth it and there is virtually no other cars!! We were able to stop and get lots of pictures without worrying about who was behind us. Lots of elk grazing by the road. The falls are absolutely beautiful.....do not miss them!!\"\"Lots of good views of Athabasca Falls, but stay on marked trails. It is dangerous to leave them. Many different angles to view these beautiful waterfalls.\"Never expected this sight and the power of river water sediment carving bowls and canyons thru solid rock.Absolutley breathtaking beauty!! The Falls were magnificent and powerful. I loved my time there and would advice anyone going to Jasper to take the short trip to the Athabasca Falls.The falls were frozen when we visited them. The lake was free from ice. It was very beautiful. You should see this at least two times. Frozen and when the water crushes down. You have a lot of platforms around the falls for the best view.Nature is amazing! A short easy walk which is well worth it. Note the beautiful rock formations as well as the falls.\"Worth a visit, wear suitable shoes and go hiking around the park. Falls are great and rush through the blow hole. Plwnty of great shots for photos.\"\"Maximum view with very little hiking effort! We took many great photos, which didn't even begin to capture how spectacular it was.\"\"Athabasca Falls is not the most stunning sight, you will experience along the Parkway, but it is certainly worth the easy in and out visit. A very powerful falls, there is a series of walkways and bridges that allow you great vantage to see the falls, the pools and the power of mother nature. You can ease right off the road, there is ample parking to a short walk. Do it!\"\"Really impressive falls,quite mesmerising to watch! Plenty of information to read and lots of different view points.\"Very popular and thus relatively crowded. Easy walk from parking lot. Allow 30 mins to take in the views. Nice and cool on a warm day due to breezes from cold water. Plan clothing accordingly - particularly if it is chilly out.\"Very powerful falls, and well worth a stop if you're travelling along the Icefield Parkway. Good interpretation along the route.\"Another great stop on the icefields parkway. Easy to get to with paved walking trails to all the good viewing spots. Amazing views of the impressive falls from all around. Take some insect repellant though!\"Awesome falls, small walk and a nice stop point along the way. Kids loved the spray coming off and it is quite amazing to see. worth stopping\"Family of 4 and our dog visited late July. It was busy but no problems getting a parking spot. Beautiful falls. Great paths to walk and lots to see. There is more than just the falls. Be sure to go down to the river and sit for a while. My boys loved building Inukshuks down by the river.Our kids loved this stop along the Ice Fields parkway. The falls are pretty spectacular and there are many nice walking paths around the area to view the falls from different locations.Go early or late in the day to avoid the crowds else you won't really get to appreciate the natural beauty of the placeThis is an essential stop. A marvel of nature and easy to access. We were impressed by the interpretive panels that educate the visitor about the river and the falls.We have been visiting Athabasca Falls for the last 35 years whenever we come to Jasper National Park and it never fails to impress. The way the walkways and lookouts are positioned around the falls give great views of the sides and front of the falls. There are also many informational posts regarding the natural history of the falls and area.The Athabasca Falls are easy to access from either the Icefields Parkway or Hwy 93A. There is lots of parking available within easy walking distance of the falls and there are bathrooms at the site.\"We were here in the peak of summer and this was one of the most impressive feats of nature I have seen! There was a gorgeous double rainbow when viewing the falls from the far side - there were also fewer people there. We got there early, but 6 buses pulled up about 10 minutes later. One of my favourite stops on our entire road trip!\"A great place to have a leisurely walk and see nature at its most powerful. Rushing falls and potholes were a feast for our eyes. We stopped here on our drive on the Icefields Parkway.\"A very unique falls, so much power pushed through such a small area is rather impressive. Very close to the carpark so not a long walk at all.\"This is an excellent stop for anyone in the Jasper area. Gorgeous waterfall which can be seen from many angles.Quick accessible stop just short of Jasper if you are on the Icefields Parkway. We were happy to stretch our legs and were thrilled with the huge volume of water that passes through the Athabasca Falls every day. It is an easy path most of the way but be prepared to encounter lots of tourists.One of the most beautiful waterfalls in the world. A must see and very accessible. The rock formations and how they built the walking areas and stairs into the natural formations is amazing.\"We've visited many waterfalls, from Niagra to Multnoma. These were absolutely beautiful! Well worth the time! Be sure to view them from above and below.\"This is a one of the must-see falls. It was crowded when we were there during last week in Jul 2014 but the stopover was well worth it. Plan to spend about an hour or two. Apply Sun block and then spray mosquito repellent before heading into the falls area.\"it's easy to get beauty overload on the icefields parkway, there are so many things to see, one nicer than the next. we ended up seeing this on our way back from jasper to lake louise and are happy we stopped. just a very powerful and pretty waterfall that's an easy walk from the parking lot.\"We visited the fall on the way to Jasper. It is a easy well maintained trail and view is interestingBeautiful but busy in summer. Just like anywhere in Banff or Jasper so if you're going during the on season expect lots of people. Regardless it's worth seeing and snapping a picture of. Athabasca falls is gorgeous and is worth the stop.\"Beautiful falls with sunlit moss on the rocks, just an easy pull off from the parkway. Viewing platforms and a bridge make it a lovely photo opportunity and meditation.\"A torrent of water. Be sure to walk further down from the falls to see the water rushing through the rocks.\"Not too far from Jasper. Awesome waterfall and canyon, very informative panels as you walk around, beautiful as you would expect. Plenty of parking\"The path is well maintained and the views are terrific. There are informative signs throughout the hike.Fantastic scenery on the way Jasper. Ample parking and no entry fee. The falls may be small compared to other examples in Canada but the views are spectacular. Well worth a visit and you can be relatively quick if pressed for time or do some longer walks. Definitely stop and see.we went here to fill in some time before going on the float boats . it was a realy lovely place to visit and we all enjoyed the vews and watching the powerfull waterfall the force of the water falling into the gorge. easy to find only 30 kilometres south of Jasper and well worth a visit\"an easy and very worthwhile walk from the parking area, the power of the falls is palpable. as with most sites, if you get there early (before 9:30 or so), you can avoid the crowds, which greatly enhances the experience.\"We did the afternoon 3 hour guided walk on the glacier and I can highly recommend it. Our guide was knowledgeable and gave us plenty of insight into the formation and history of the glacier. It was a great experience\"An easy drive and so close to parking, a great easy walk with lots of interesting angles of the falls. Loved it.\"\"Do not be tempted to drive by this attraction! It is well worth parking up, despite the busy car park, and walking through the various pathways to see (and hear) the falls and consequent gorges.\"Definite stop! Nice walking trails to different viewing areas. I was on a bus tour so it was crowded but worth it.Took many photos here but hard to capture the power of the water. Again many tourists in July. But would not have missed this sight!\"Visited the falls twice, first time on our way back to Jasper from the Icefields. We thought it was going to be busy (mid afternoon) and we were not mistaken! Nevertheless, with a bit of waiting around we took the photos we wanted but gave up on some aspects as we planned to visit again en route to Lake Louise. As per usual, our second visit at 9:00 was just ideal, few people and a glorious sunny day so a permanent rainbow in the mist from the main falls - a real postcard moment and worth the early start.\"Fantastic scenery within a short drive of Jasper. Ample parking and no entry fees. The falls may be small compared to other examples in Canada but the views are spectacular. Well worth a visit.Wow what an amazing falls and the walk ways around the falls allow you to view from so many angles. we were there as the sun came over the mountains and a lovely way to start the morning.\"Breathtaking, fabulous falls we travelled in July and the amount of water going over was just breathtaking, make sure you go.\"Crowded but with patience you can get your shots. Don't forget to look around for mountain goats! Sun position not critical.Stopped briefly at the falls on a coach trip from Banff to Jasper. They are stunning! I wish we had had more time there.Visited the falls as part of our Brewsters Icefields Parkway trip from Banff to Jasper and they are quite a sight. The amazing river suddenly descends down the gorges cut out by the water over thousands of years revealing splendid rock formations and different colours.Well worth the stop to visit.\"These falls were our first stop as we drove south from Jasper. We found plenty of parking and it was an easy walk to the falls. There are many viewpoints for the falls, getting a different view from each one. There are a couple of viewpoints where you feel the mist. From one of the viewpoints we even saw a rainbow coming off the falls. Be sure you bring your camera!!! A must see attraction!!!!\"\"We were on a coach trip for three days, and one of the trips was to the falls and they were lovely. All my family enjoyed the visit to the falls.\"\"Stopped on the way home from jasper, plenty of parking there and it really only takes like a hour there if you want. There is a path that takes you over by the first falls and you can get soaked from the mist, also there are plenty of great vantage points for pictures of the falls from one of the many bridges! Do not miss out if in the area!\"\"The falls are quite amazing in the middle of summer when the water flow is at a peak. There are trails from the top of the falls, a bridge across the falls and then trails down to the river below. I soent a good 30 minutes walking around, you could easily stay longer\"All the waterfalls in this area are great and this is no exception. Go and visit as its great. Sometimes you get to see a rainbow over the water. Take your cameraDefinitely stop here. A very short walk and a very impressive view of the falls. A bit of a romantic areaA must stop outside of Jasper. You can get very very close to the falls and it is a great photographing opportunity.We were here on an cloudy/rainy morning after a major storm the night before. The mountains were still hidden behind a low cloud cover. The water flowing through the falls was white and heavy. Easy walk from the bus. I recommend staying on the established trails as some of the area is fairly steep. Lots of photo ops!We stopped on to way to Banff. It was really worth the stop. The car park is big enough and there are washrooms. It was very impressive. We really enjoyed the view. It was a rainy day so the flow was even more impressive. It is pretty noisy and you might get a little bit wet. It is only a 5 min walk from the car park to the falls. You can take a longer walk if you wish and see the falls from both sides.\"Excellent powerful falls easily accessible for all, including buggy's and wheelchairs. Thunderous sound of the falls and spray. Good parking within 100 metres more like 50 actually and so much better than Sunwapta. If you only do one set of falls in Jasper National park do these!\"The falls are impressive and worth the stop. Much more accessible than some of the other falls I've visited.\"Definitely a place to see. Short trails from parking lot w/ beautiful view on falls. OK, it's not Niagara, but very impressive too. We enjoyed this very much.\"\"This falls is right off the Icefields Parkway and is absolutely breathtaking. There are pathways that allow you to meander along its route a bit and see the falls from various angles. At one point you can stop and feel the mist from the falls. This was our second trip here, and it was as exciting as the first. This time we brought my brother and his wife along and they were as impressed as we were. As my sister-in-law said...\"\"I could just stay here all day and be happy\"\".\"\"Nice quick stop to get up close with a powerful waterfall and view the sheer force of nature in all its glory. Very easy access, even for those with limited mobility.\"\"Especially is you are not a hiker and do not get to see falls like this often. Super easy access, magnificent falls. It is busy though, try to go early to avoid the crowd ....\"\"We have been here several times, love the falls and the view! Well worth the drive! Walking on the paths is flat unless you take the path to the lake.\"The falls were beautiful. Very short hike from the parking area which makes for easy access. No charge. Many photo ops. Do no miss these falls if driving highway 93 between Banff and Jasper.\"First time visit and we were dazzled by the beauty of the falls and enjoyed watching some rafters head down the lake. Our youngest is three, so we had to by extra mindful of him, but the walk was great and the scenery incredible. We'll most definitely return!\"This has got to be on your list if you are 'doing the Rockies'. Make sure you walk to the end to see the second part of the falls.\"Very nice scenic location and short walk in that our elderly companions had no trouble with! I do prefer Maligne Canyon myself, if I only had time to stop in one place, Maligne is too difficult for seniors to walk as steep going on the way back up. So this is a nice alternative.\"Breathtaking. Be sure to take your camera with you and go right to the bottom to get the full experience.\"Quite nice, as always it is walking to the falls themselves that adds to the overall experience.Also by going to these areas it gives you the chance of seeing animals. We saw 3 deer.\"\"Beautiful Falls. Easy to walk on paved path for teens to seniors in our group. Reminded me on a smaller scale here to Tremmelbach falls in Switzerland, except these are free. Our entire group enjoyed this stop. Falls are short walk from parking lot.\"The falls themselves are spectacular but we also love to hike down to the bottom and take in the beauty of the lake!\"Fantastic experience, the falls were roaring again, every time we have visited we've been lucky enough to see a spectacular display at the falls\"Good stop off whilst driving along Icefields Parkway. Small falls with walk ways and viewing platforms. It took us about 45 minutes to do the whole falls. If you are making a special trip to view some falls I recommend Maligne falls which are stunning.\"Superb waterfalls with many viewing points. Worth stopping to visit, quite a lot of parking. Washrooms are interesting\"\"What with these falls and Maligne Canyon in the same area it seems you are spoilt for spectacular waterfalls and canyons. Nothing more to add-we too saw these falls as part of a Brewster ice field parkway tour to Jasper. Well worth a stop, although they can be viewed in 10-15 minutes.\"\"It was a bit of a hike for us +50's, stairs and such so it was great exercise, our little dog enjoyed seeing the falls lol. It was an amazing site to see!\"We weren't overly impressed to be honest. the falls are mighty and the setting is nice but still failed to hit the spot.To stand so close to this powerful waterfall gives you a true sense of the energy that powers through the gouge and valley. It makes it easy to see how the rocks have been shaped over the years.\"A must stop! Definitely go down all the way, so you can see what the water has done to the rock. Great pics when the weather is right!\"This was part of a Brewster tour along the Icefields parkway. Excellent photo opportunities and informative commentary. Information boards at site useful. Stunning falls!We loved the falls and took lots of photos. Saw this as part of a tour group. It is a must see.Was very voluminous with water from the snow melt.\"amazing view what natures provides all of us. well worth the drive amazing wonders of the world easy to get to, free to access,\"An amazing falls. You can see a rainbow almost anytime. There are many great views of the falls and a few short hikes nearby.Viewing these falls is awesome. Lots of great view points. Lots of room to manoeuvre around the crowds. Good parking. A great way to spend a few hours.Every stop is picture postcard around this area & the Athabasca Falls are no exception - breathtakingly beautiful !these falls are amazing so much water coming through such a small space. lots of opportunities to view the falls close up\"We had looked at the Bow River Falls in Banff proper and while they're famous for their appearence in the 1953 Marilyn Monroe film River of No Return, they're not exactly spectacular. I almost didn't care if we skipped these... wow, would that have been a mistake. The falls themselves start off with a steep plunge into a set of pools, so the sound of crashing water is impressive. There is a path around the falls and it is well worth it to walk to the other side as on sunny days there are beautiful rainbows (I'll post a picture of them) to view. They have moved the fences very close to the falls so you get very good views of the falls. The water swirls at the bottom so there are these cool circular pools carved into the rock. There are also several paths that lead down closer to the lower parts of the falls and bridges that allow for great photos. VERY impressive stop. One note.... numerous people were seen climbing the fences to get pictures closer to the edge of the falls and this behavior scared the pants off many. I was told several people a year go over the edge. I believe this is because the signs are only in English and French, and believe new signs should be placed in Japanese and Chinese warning to to scale the fence. You don't need these at ever site but this site has the potential for great danger. Just a thought.\"\"We stopped on our way back to Jasper from Maligne Lake. It was gorgeous! It's always nice to be able to cool off during the day when it gets hot and this is an excellent spot to do it! There is a trail you can take to the bottom of the falls and dip your feet on the water. There's also a spot you can stand and enjoy the mist :)Tips:- comfortable shoes! - take your camera and water- give your self an hour, at least. - please don't litter and stick to the trails.\"\"Not far off the Icefields Parkway, more touristy but worth seeing. The hiking areas were mostly wooden walkways, easy walking.\"The falls in the Canadian Rockies are known less for their size and drop as for the sheer power of the water rushing through narrow parts of the rivers. Athabasca is one of the best and just outside Jasper.We visited in early July when the falls were full and the water was rushing over the rocks. What a magnificent place! I could have stayed for hours!An easy drive and lots of wildlife in the area. The falls themselves are amazing and the river itself is beautiful. The trail is very easy and has some incredible viewpoints. You can even feel the spray from the falls.You must stop and see these falls. Unbelievable how fast the water is gushing through these very narrow and deep gorges. There is a walking track around the falls so you get a good view from different angles. It is just off the Icelands parkway.\"After the Athabaskan Glacier and The Skywalk, this was breathtaking as well. What a beautiful fall. Worthwhile to visit.\"Right off the Icefields Parkway and definitely worth the stop. The river drops through a short but deep gorge; paths and stairs let you see the whole thing from various vantage points. Enjoy the spray on a hot day!We could hear the roar of the water as we opened the car door. The paths to the falls are very well done. The falls are stunning. Make sure you have your camera. Would recommend.This is a must see if driving the Icefields Parkway. The falls are only a short stroll from the parking area and the trails offer great vantage points.\"It's a little bit outside Jasper, so it's easy to miss it, but it's worth the stop :it's quite close to the road, so very accessible !The power of those Falls is quite impressive...It might be a little bit in the shadows early in the morning so not so easy to take good pictures,I think around noun the sunlight might be better...\"I could't find the beauty of the famous Athabasca falls.. maybe wasn't a good day to visit it... but the water was extremely brown\"You can hear the roar of these falls from far away; once you're near, you'll be impressed by the sheer volume of water. Spend some time wandering and taking pictures\"Bring your camera. You'll want to take plenty of nature photographs here. I myself took 488 shots. It was glorious.Huge falls that you can easily spend hours enjoying and photographing. Make sure you go down to the abandon part of the falls.\"Great place to go , kids loved it especially where you could get sprayed with water!!Easily accessibleToilets were very smelly would not recommend to use them\"Great attraction near the Icefield parkway lends itself to lots of tourists so it can get a bit crowded. I suspect anyone nearby stops with good reason. One of the many must see places in the Canadian Rockies.Departing Jasper you will see Athabasca Falls on the way back down towards Banff. I did notice a bridge and a lot of mist while heading north but did not stop. On the way back down South I pulled off the freeway and it is a very short drive to the parking lot and an even shorter walk to view the falls. Definitely worth the stop to check out the falls. Beautiful (is there any waterfall that isn't??). One of the must see if you are visiting Banff and Jasper National Parks.\"We stopped here on the way from Banff to Jasper, this is one of the myst see locations near Jasper. Easily accessible from the car park so its a great location for families to visit. A short easy walk brings you straight to the falls. We walked across the bridge and had a different view of the falls. The spray and mist was quite something, almost like having a spray shower which the kids loved! Another short walk downstream brings you to the canyon view. The walk is interesting as it brings you down a flight of stairs that seemed to be carved out of huge rocks!\"\"Fantastic views, all around. Millions of years powerful currents carving stunning sculptures.If you are a smoker or enjoy littering, please have some respect for the nature & drive right past this spot.\"Awesome -amongst most spectacular natural phenomenon I have ever seen. Access and presentation excellent.\"A must see when visiting Jasper, great views of the falls from many different angles and vatage points\"Good car parking. If you can walk 200 yds and do 56 well maintained 30 degree steps down then up again then you can see the lot from all angles. Still worth seeing even without doing the steps.We did this as the first of a three stop day out of Jasper. Next was Sunaptra Falls then a trip down to 'glacier central'. On our trip we saw black bears (with cubs) at the roadside and mountain goats and of course amazing scenery.A good stop but perhaps a bit of a geography field trip stop rather than a 'wow' so don't base your whole day on it.\"We were told to see Athabasca Falls as a preference to Sunwapta Falls if time was limited. We did Sunwapta on the way to Jasper then Athabasca on the way back to Lake Louise. Athabasca Falls is very impressive and is very close to the highway, much more impressive than Sunwapta.\"Well worth the turn off the highway. Amount of water and the noise is amazing. Short walk from car park so no problem seeing this great sight.It is a very impressive area and not far off the highway so be sure to take the time to visit. How did the fish get above those falls???The sheer power and volume of these falls is not to be missed. A good location to see a beautiful without the long walks required of other locations in this area.\"What surprised me was that the water was very brown. The walking path was nice enough, but I didn't find it too exciting.\"\"They may not match up to Niagra, but the Athabasca Falls certainly show just what water can do! These thunderings falls are carving a real chasm through the rocks and although they are not going to occupy you for hours it is a great free show with interesting information scattered around the many viewing areas. Definitely worth a visit if you are in jasper and especially if, like it was when we were there, the weather wasn't good enough to be heading up the mountains!\"If you don't like waterfalls than it probably is not for you but the walk is what I would class as an easy hike take a camera and a bottle of water and your set a great free attraction to do\"A must see for anyone visiting the Jasper area of the Rockies. The falls are magnificent, especially with the mountains in the background and there are several very good viewing areas from which to take photos.When we were returning to our coach, we spotted a black bear grazing in the wooded area adjacent to one of the pathways. It was calmly minding its own business so we did the same but got back to the coach faster than I think we would have done if we hadn't noticed the bear.\"\"Athabasca Falls enjoys a super tourist friendly approach (i.e. fast and paved) just off of the Icefields Parkway. Its a worthwhile stop, but expect loads of tourists and noise. The falls themselves are nice, although nothing too amazing if you've seen waterfalls and river canyons before.\"\"Athabasca Falls is a waterfall in Jasper National Park, situated next to the road. It is not known for its height, but for its force due to the large quantity of water falling into the gorge. It can be safely viewed and photographed from various viewing platforms and walking trails around the falls. I managed to capture the brillance of rainbow hued sprays at one part of the falls. From the start of the Upper Athabasca river, the water is calm. At the start of the falls, is also calm. Then the water gains momentum, and one can see the sheer force of the waters, rushing vigorously , powerfully down into the gorge. Then after the great fall, one sees calmness again\"\"Plenty of good viewing places and relevant information boards. Visiting in May we got to see ice and a good flow of water. The pathways are pretty good, watch your footing where tree roots have caused them to become uneven.\"\"these falls are right by the road, so anyone passing by has no excuse for not stopping. Really good views of the falls from many viewing areas, and plenty of great photo opportunities.I've knocked a star off because the toilets were absolutely disgusting. The smell almost made me sick.All in all, a must-see waterfall but avoid the conveniences.\"\"Visited this area in April. The waterfall and ice formations were beautiful and fascinating. It wasn't completely frozen, so some water was flowing down the waterfall. Beautiful views of the blue-green water on the other side of a bridge.\"Beautiful waterfall with good access longer walks possible easy to find with good parking great place to view wildlife.Lovely waterfall on the glacial river. Liked the Good info as you walked down to it. Nothing to dislike\"I was blown away by the Partnachklamm near Garnisch, The Athabasca Gorge is the nearest thing on this continent to reflect the shear power of water.\"\"While we were in Jasper we did a drive out to the falls. They are just a short walk from the parking lot and certainly worth seeing. You can hear the power of the water as you get closer. There are lots of information boards around and whilst at the main falls there are a few different viewing areas so make your way around. There is another trail which heads down the canyon for more views. I was reluctant to try it as there were warning signs about the number of steps involved on the return trip.Ended up doing it. Going down was fine and there were a LOT of steps but the lower canyon was also a great spot and the climb back, whilst tiring was manageable. You can take your time and have a rest along the way if need be.\"\"Good parking facilities and a very easy and nice walk to a majestic view. Walk around as much as you feel like and spend as much time as you can afford. We stop by each time we drive to Jasper and are equally impressed each time, as the falls and the surrounding area are in continuous change.\"\"The Falls are very easily accessible from the parking lot. They are well worth the short walk. Just over the top beautiful and amazing. Exceptional photos opportunities. Canada is packed full of majesty and beauty, Athabasca Falls is among the many fantastic sites to see. If you have mobility problems, do not skip this place very easy to maneuver.\"We took the shorter walk around the falls but it is beautiful and worth it. With time the longer walk would be nice too.\"The water has eroded the softer layers of rock here leaving harder layers behind, eventually cutting right down, making a narrow cut through which the water thunders down. The footpaths offer superb view-points from which to admire, photograph or simply stand and enjoy the wonder of this place. There are, like most attractions in Canada, comprehensive informative information boards to educate visitors.Do locate and visit the falls known as Natural Bridge in Yoho National Park. It is very different, stunning, not suitable for disabled or the faint hearted, if you have a little courage you can hop, skip and jump across this natural phenomena and take some brilliant photos or even videos. It will not disappoint those who love nature.\"\"The Falls are just a short walk from the parking lot. Another trail heads down the canyon for more views, but warns the visitor that there are a lot of stairs one will need to walk up on the return. But, the hike down the Lower Canyon is not necessary to enjoy the power and magnificence of these Falls. The main Falls are an easy hike and appear handicap accessible. A definite stop/hike to make.\"\"You start at the top of this extremely powerful and breathtaking waterfall and venture your way down to where the waterfall calmly streams into a wide river surrounded by mountains. You'll get some beautiful pictures, just don't drop your phone.\"An easy five-minute walk from the parking lot and you're there. Very impressive falls with lots of information on the boards about how the falls were formed. Not to be missed.\"A short pleasant walk from the car park to see these falls.Not high but a river squeezed into a canyon, the access is good but hang on to your kids!The power of the water going through the rocks is awesome!\"Easy access from the parking area. Very little walking required. Lots of viewing areas and photo ops. Definitely worth the stop.\"There is waterfall, and river to admire. The Park rangers also showed off a bear hides. Not much facilities though.\"This is quite close to the road and very much worth the stop. It's neither a long nor strenuous hike to see a lovely waterfall cutting uniquely through the rock formations.We stopped in on the way to the Icefields and are so glad we did not miss this. Great pathways. Get there early.You shouldn't go to Jasper or Lake Louise without stopping along the way to see this gorgeous waterfall and short walk to many vantage points. Very beautiful.\"Another of natures many wonders in this part of the world. I would suggest that if you're travelling to Banff, you see the falls on your way there. Only a short walk from the car park and you at the powerfull falls. There isn't a huge amount to do here, however I could stare at waterfalls all day so for me, loved it! It's also free!\"You have to be impressed with the power of water. Gallons and gallons roaring over the falls carving stone with consistent force and beauty. I have never been to Niagara Falls but I imagine that this is a slice of what it is like. We were on a tour and couldn't stay as long as we wanted. If I was fortunate enough to come back I would stay much longer and enjoy the trails and follow the roar of the water further. If you can go do so.Very good place for family outing. Fall views are well protected to have good view of the fall. Do follow the safety rules as water is fast and furious.Great scenery and water falls well worth a visit if you have time however the cafe prior to this is not worth the stop for coffee.\"Because it was snowing, this was a winter wonderland! Quite intriguing how the water rushes through. Good signage explaining what is happening!\"\"Although I was originally a little shocked that they'd compare these falls to Niagara, or even the splendor of The Great Wall of China and the Pyramids of Egypt (they actually do on the signs!), the Athabasca Falls were still a treat.Beyond the main falls, there is a number of short walks available which are also worth taking and it was disappointing (but great for us) that not many of the tourists bothered to make the detour. Situated between Jasper and the Columbian Icefields, I definitely recommend making a stop here at Athabasca Falls.\"\"We were advised by our hosts in Jasper to be sure to do this falls and they were right. Awesome falls in the spring of the year as the snow is melting. Who doesn't love a roaring falls?? Be sure to put this on your \"\"To Do\"\" list.\"\"We only were able to spend a short time at these falls which were stunning. It was not very busy so we had good views. We walked from the car park, short distance, and easy paths, but can be a bit skippy in places on the concrete. Plenty of places to take some good pictures.\"Beautiful! Took about 45 minutes to walk around the various paths. Many photo ops. Loved it! Beware: many steps.\"The walk here is another beautiful sight to see. Along the road, we saw a lot of wildlife. We only stayed a short while as the trail was quite busy.\"Fantastic what nature can do. This was a lovely day out for us. Thoroughly enjoyed the amazing falls.\"Unexpectedly beautiful. From the parking lot, my husband said 'there are no waterfalls here'...only to turn a corner and see absolute beauty!\"There is a walkway around the falls that lets you get right up close to them. We were lucky enough to be there when it wasn't busy but I can imagine that it can get quite full in season. Really impressive!\"The falls are quite stunning and the rock formations which they created over millions of years are now very accessible via an improved hiking trail and new bridges. Naturally carved \"\"stairways\"\" are a beautiful sight. There are new rest room facilities as well. You cannot get the full experience and views from the highway or your car.\"\"We were only there for a short time during a trip,but it is well worth a stop. The area is lovely and the falls are powerful and you can get some great snaps\"Nice short hike. Beautiful. We actually photographer here at night since it's a short little walk on a paved path from the parking lot.Easy to walk around. Amazing views. Its free. Easy to find. Ample parking. Worth a visit. Preferred it to Sunwapta Falls - more to see and read.The waterfalls is OK. We spent about one hour to walk around and take pictures. It is easy to access the falls.While on our Canadian Rockies tour we were taken to Athabasca Falls by our tour guide. He said there are other waterfalls in the area but this was the nicest. We were not dissapointed. The falls are a short paved walk from the parking area easily accessable to those with handicaps. And the view of the falls is well worth the short stop. There are walking trails to the side of the falls to get a different view which I would not recommend for those with handicaps. There is also a stepped walkway to the bottom of the falls. Take a few minutes and enjoy this natural beauty.\"Stopped on our way to Banff. We'll worth the time and the walk, although as short as you want. We never went the whole way as bridge 5 was closed, still early season and the bears were just starting to appear. In a way some of the features were like Maligne Canyon but very different in other ways. Another must see in Canada.\"\"Well worth a 30 minute stop on your way down the Icefields Parkway. Close to the carpark, and an impressive amount of water coming over.\"The falls were full and powerful. This is our third visit and we are still in awe of these falls.There is an interesting trail that follows one of the river used to flow and you can walk right up to the end where the river opens up.It was really good to go there in June as the melted snow makes for a very full waterfall.Easy access to a wonderful series of falls. We were there in the height of the melt water coming down from the surrounding area so not sure how impressive they would be later in the year. Maybe something to bear in mindThis is the most convenient of the canyons/falls in Jasper and Banff and it is very impressive. A very short walk (couple 100 yrds if that) and then you can go further if you want. All paved. Because of its convenience expect crowds and tour buses. Crowds aren't our thing but we're glad we stopped by for 15-20min.\"We saw woodlands orchids in bloom on the path to the falls. This is not an easy place for elders or handicapped individuals, but otherwise- just awesome. The view left little to be desired if you like waterfalls.\"Beautiful location - the mountains in the background are only beaten by the stunning falls themselves. A must see.We stopped off at the falls as we drove the Icefields Parkway and were very pleased that we did. The fals themselves were very easy to get to from the car park and were in ful flow - the sound was wonderful and the view even better.\"This is one of the more popular waterfalls along the parkway (as seen by the number of tour buses that stop here). Lots of paths make it easy to see the falls with several viewpoints, each with great views. This is probably the most impressive waterfall on the entire drive between Jasper and Banff, well worth stopping by while driving the Icefields Parkway.\"Amazing!!! Easy to access and visit on the way thought the Icefields Parkway and to walk around. Only takes a short topi me to see it all but worth the stopeasy access from car park. beautiful falls. The thaw had just started so lots of snow and lots and lots of water. Well worth a visit.There was a lot of water because the snow started melting. Impressive noise and sight on the water thats smashed down. Following the stairs you see the rockets with the different colours after ages pressure of the water.\"thundering sound of the water crashing over the rocks was great!fascinating how the water has sculpted the landscape\"This is a short easy walk near the Icefields Parkway. As you walk along the paved path you discover more and more sights of water.\"The Falls have an excellent system of walkways and vantage points to watch the water thundering through the gorge. Lots of different picture possibilities here.Also excellent parking and picnic areas nearby.There is no long hiking trail to get there (unlike many attractions in the park), so only a drive to the site and you're there.\"\"I always love going and seeing these awesome Falls! My favourite part is after you cross the bridge, turn right and you walk down stairs where the water used to run... I always find it fascinating!Almost every time we go, there is some one climbing over a fence. There are signs every where saying how slippery the rocks are. If you go visit these falls, be warned, people have died from climbing over the fences to take pictures. The Falls are beautiful and amazing even from behind the fences so please stay safe!\"\"The Falls are easy to reach. The view was breathtaking. There where 2 busloads of tourists so we waited 15 minutes till they where gone, then we had the Falls in a private session.\"\"Amazing waterfalls and canyon. Like many other popular attractions in the Canadian Rockies, this too is highly accessible from car-park with only a few minutes walking.The twist is that the water hasn't always flew in the same channel, it used to flow in another parallel channel, until the water managed to beat the rock and find an alternative, better route (the current channel). So what you can see today is both the wet canyon and the dry canyon - scar that remained from the past, when water used to flow in its previous path.\"An amazing visit with family. The view is amazing a must see. Walking is not too bad. The amount of water going through these falls is amazing.\"Stopped here driving from Lake Louise to Jasper to give the kids a break. For such a great view and scenic wonder this is very non-touristy. No gift shops, pay parking, guidebooks, etc but still a walkway with information boards and great access. The kids loved it. Down on the lake shore many visitors have stacked stones to mark their own visit. In many countries these would get knocked down and ruined but he they are left. Making a form of visitors book.\"\"Stopped off at the falls on the way to Jasper. Well worth a walk to the far side of the falls to get the best views of the falls and the gorge below.Good parking close to the falls.\"If you are in the area do not miss this it is very cool to see how the water has carved a trench through the rock over the years. Mother Nature at her finest!!Huge water fall with interesting short hike in the same area as you step through where the falls used to be. One of the better Falls in the Parks and is worth the stop.\"This waterfall was mostly frozen, when we visited it. It was still stunning to see. Unfortunately one of the walks was blocked off due to snow, however this didn't prevent seeing some great views of the falls\"\"Perfect setting for an engagement:) We drove from Ontario to British Columbia in September of 2000 and stopped at Athabasca Falls on the way. It is beautiful, plain and simple. Definitely recommend a stop here.\"A very pretty waterfall with a nice hike around it. Try to do the full circuit walk for views from different vantage points. We visited when it was raining lightly. The pathways were slippery but we had a very beautiful rainbow over it. One of the highlights of the trip.\"It is a very beautiful stop. You can see the falls easily from the parking lot. However if you're looking for a hike its a really easy, beautiful, and short hike. I'd guess less than 2-3 km total. Just make sure to stay behind the barriers. The rocks here are super slippery and dangerous if you ignore the barriers.\"\"The falls is just magnificent even if it's still frozen when we went there. You would just imagine how beautiful it could be during summer when the water is fast moving. If you plan to come during the spring, you should wear good hiking and/or winter shoes for traction as the stairs and some tracks are still icy and slippery.We'll try to come back during the summer to see the difference.\"Athabasca falls are one of the gems along the icefield parkway from Jasper to Banff. Very easy walk from the parking lot to the falls and viewpoints just on the edge of the falls. Beware of some water puddles and spraying. Our 7 years old really enjoyed and it was also an excellent photo op.\"We were here while there was still snow on the ground. While we had a decent time, and enjoyed the walk, I don't recommend going in the winter, especially if you have mobility issues, as the stairs are not cleared and are quite slippery. We ended up going down the stairs and then at the other side climbing up the hill to the road to have an easier walk back.\"\"Thunderous waterfall with easy access for the mobility challenged. Do NOT get close to the edge though! In addition to the \"\"rush\"\" from being close to this much water moving this fast, you may even see the resident black bear with cubs!\"\"Me and my two friends stopped at Athabasca Falls on our way from skiing at Marmot Basin. It was at the end of winter, so all the other attractions along the way to Lake Louis were closed. Athabasca Falls were the only accessible through the snow and it was definitely worth stopping by.They were all frozen and it was magical to see that even such a power can freeze down and make incredible sculptures. The trail around them was covered in snow and not all open, so we had to watch our step, so we didn't fall.\"\"If you travel by car from Jasper, there's an alternative and interesting drive to the main Icefields Highway - turn right about 10km south of Jasper onto route 93A and have a relaxed and interesting drive. the road ends at the Falls, where it rejoins the Icefields Highway. The falls, although not especially high, are spectacular and the National Park management have installed walkways and a bridge that allows everyone to safely get close to many facets of the cascades.\"A must see while travelling. A great excuse to stop and stretch your legs and see some pretty special falls and learn some history along the wayWe love Jasper area and make it a regular stop every year. Been coming to the falls ever since I was young. Now I bring my children. Can't wait until this yearThe trembling waters cutting through the mountain is amazing. Completely in awe at the sheer beauty!\"If you're in the Jasper area in the winter, take the short 20 minute drive (not including stopping for photos of a lot of wildlife!) to the Athabasca Falls. They truly are stunning when they're frozen.When we were there in February, the river and falls were almost completely frozen solid. There was still a bit of water running, but not much. We went in the early afternoon, around 2pm. There was still enough sun to hit the ice and make it shine.Be careful of your footing, and wear proper winter footwear. The paths are someone maintained, but they are covered in snow and some ice. Common sense and good shoes will keep you safe!\"\"I love Athabasca Falls! It doesn't matter how many times I see them, I am still awed by their sheer power and beauty. I've stopped here in winter as well and the silence and stillness of these massive falls is equally impressive in winter.\"\"Athabasca Falls is my absolute favorite place to go while in Jasper. I love nature and seeing how the land, trees, and overall landscape change over time. Athabasca Falls delivers on every level. The informative plaques describe how the falls came to be, where the water once flowed and how the course has changed, and offer information on the history. Although the summer is my favorite time to visit the roaring falls I most definitely enjoyed our recent trip to the falls. As the parking lot was not cleared we ended up parking on the side of the road and walking down. Having Athabasca Falls to ourselves without a sound around but the small hole of flowing water that broke under the frozen falls was absolutely surreal! We toured around, carefully, and took pictures of the sites without having to wait for other tourists which is uncommon. I love the falls in the summer but the winter visit did not disappoint!\"lots of areas to walk to to see the falls and the breath taking views of them roaring down was awesome!\"We were in Jasper on the weekend looking to for a hike or a walk suitable for small children. Our 4 kids are ages 5-13 and we all loved the scenic 20 minute drive out to the falls and the short, easy walk to see the frozen waterfalls. The kids played in the snow and there are outdoor toilets nearby for potty breaks! It was free fun and we loved it. Stayed about an hour out there.\"\"Right off the Ice filed Hwy heading toward Jasper, a few minutes moderate hike to the fall itself. Specular views and the sound of the water hitting of the rocks makes it that much visiting. You really get to feel the power of the water flow. Camera is a must, wonderful spots for pix. Numerous platforms to view the fall from different angles, not too busy with tourists and a must visit if travelling along the ice field parkway.\"These falls are beautiful! There are lots of pathways and stairs so some places are not very accessible if you have mobility issues. Lots of places to take pictures and different views. I enjoyed reading all the signs and we will definitely stop here again!\"I am only rating these falls as average as we only saw them from the road bridge which is a real shame (this is because we didn't want to be naughty and push our luck parking up on the road and wandering in which is what a lot of people seem to do)Even from the bridge you get a reasonable view of the falls and a really good impression of their magnificence, I have been in autumn and they were breath taking\"The sheer size of the falls and the excellent walkway with narrative boards made a very pleasant stopping place on the way to the Colombi Icefields\"These falls are pretty much right next to the Icefields Parkway. The lot where you park is a short walk to the main falls. The falls are truly spectacular (I keep using that adjective for attractions along the Parkway, and with good reason...it's true). The sound of the water cascading over the falls is very soothing, There are several areas you can walk to to view different areas of the falls, but the one you approach first is really great. Don't pass up this attraction while travelling the Icefields Parkway. It is very worthwhile and extremely accessible.\"\"It is just fabulous, incredible colours of the water, the lake, and the trail in the woods under huge rocks makes it a must stop in Jasper!\"\"Pretty short and very enjoyable hike. The falls are lovely and if it's in the summer, the water mist is very cooling and enjoyable. The trail is well shaded as well.\"\"This place is amazing in winter. The falls had frozen solid and displayed some amazing blues,greens & turquoise. The walk down to the falls was a bit dangerous and older people could easily fall. So good walking shoes are a must in the winter.\"This short hike (which took us awhile because of how many pictures we were all taking) is an awesome way to see the beautiful glacier fed Athabasca River. The rock formations around the river are unlike anywhere I had seen before. Got some awesome photos! The walk is not too strenuous and I believe the upper portion is even handicapped accessible.\"Athabasca Falls was something so beautiful, newer seen anything like this. We were there early morning, waiting for the first sunlight. No tourist rush, no screaming children... just calm and beautiful.\"A must visit for everyone. Stunning visually but the sound it makes is tremendous. A video camera is essential\"The canyon is a fascinating formation. It twists and turns, it narrows to a slot canyon than opens up into a wide waterfall. Make sure you give yourself the time to do the whole walk around the area.\"\"These are majestic falls and worth a visit off the highway.It may look serene as you anter, but take a look much further in and you will not be disappointed at all. Sadly the concrete walkways detract from the natural awe and charm evident here. However, they are there to protect you from the canyon below. Do check it out if your nearby. Worth it!!!\"\"Went with sun dog tours excellent trip ,stopped on way to Banff ,the power of water incredible plus the beautiful colours.\"We went in November & the ice added to the beauty of the falls. I would highly recommend going in late autumnThis is a must stop see just outside of the city of Jasper! It is very safe but yet you fell so close you could almost touch it!The view of the Falls is great and no one should miss it if they are in the vicinity. At the time of our visit the river was literally overflowing with ice-melted water and the view was overwhelming.\"Easy to get to, located right off of the icefields parkway. Can get crowded do to the convenient location but definitely a must see attraction in Jasper!\"\"We went to Athabasca falls on a Sunday so was more busy but was cool and sunny and spectacular. A definite place I would recommend, beautiful.\"\"If you are driving by, it is worth stopping for. But it is not special enough to drive any distance to see.\"\"Regardless of whatever time you view them throughout the year, the Athabasca Falls are guaranteed to be running solidly. Some excellent walkways and bridges have been added over the years which allow excellent viewing of the falls from most angles. Venture a bit further afield and you are able to view further down the river where the falls resume with the meandering river. Well worth the turnoff for the view\"We really enjoyed walking around here. There are a number of pathways and viewpoints allowing you to get a feel for the water and how the rocks have been reshaped.A sobering memorial explains how a young guy fell off the slippery (having climbed over the guard rail!) and that a couple of people die each year! Stay behind the rails...This is well worth the visit to see how the water has cut it's way through the rocks. Not very high (like Helmcken falls) but the shapes that have been carved out are amazing. You are able to walk through an area where the water used to flow but no longer does and the shapes are great to see. Good toilet facilities on site (the usual pit in the ground) and well worth a visit.You need stamina to make the trek all around the falls. There is so he areas where a wheelchair can access the falls but really you need good legs to climb stairs and rpt filed trails.We came to see the natural beauty of Canada and weren't disappointed. If your going to Banff then drop past on your way there.We had considered skipping this stop but are very glad that we didn't! the falls are spectacular and are another must see in Jasper National Park.\"Considering it is right on the side of the road, you should definitely stop by and have a look at this. It's a lovely waterfall, with a nice river, all of it a lovely azure. It was very easy walk, and very close to the Jasper town.\"\"This is worth stopping for. Opportunity to take some beautiful photos of the falls with the mountain in background. Easy walk suitable for all. Usual restroom facilities, plenty of parking.\"not the highest falls in Jasper but definitely one of the most beautiful... Why? Because you see the battle between water & rock. Different paths are formed & you see what what water can do with rocks. Also the trail tells you how this happens. the Trail is max 45 min and is worth every minute of your time. Easy accessibleBring your camera. What an interesting geological site. The walk to the falls was easy and there were interpretive signs along the way.Must do stop....it is stunning. Take hike over to lake it is lovely as well. There are quite a few different things to see there.give yourself lots of time.\"These easily accessible falls are worth the Icefield parkway stop. The colors are amazing, as well as the cliffside \"\"gardens\"\". The falls start is turbulent which you can follow as they cascade into a aquamarine pool which will take the waters to the Arctic waters.\"\"What's interesting about the rockies is that there are so many little detours you can take to see something beautiful and this is one of the ones we came across on a spontaneous road trip. The falls are gorgeous, and there's a pretty well constructed path for you to follow to experience it. Besides the $20 fee to enter Jasper National Park there's no cost to visit the individual sights in the area. This waterfall is gorgeous. though quite busy in the summer.\"When I got there I was a little dissapointed. Thought the attraction was just a few small falls we see right when we get there. But there is so much more. The water's color is unreal and all the rocky mountains around it make it a beautiful picture. The power of nature is stunning. Good place to stop and watch and think.These falls can be looked at from different angles. Each viewpoint opens a new vista to the onlooker. The walk in is a gentle walk. Enjoy\"Truly spectacular falls - the day we were there was freezing cold but well worth the trip.The cuts taken out of the rocks below the falls are also spectacular\"\"Was there twice this year. Once in July, where the falls wer in full force, and once in October 2013, where they were much more passive. Always a great sight to go see. One warning though, stay behind the fence. There is always someone climbing over the fence for a better picture and there has been deaths due to this. Please respect the falls.\"\"This is a great place to stop and enjoy the power of nature first hand. Only steps from the highway, Athabaska Falls will let you see why and how water can carve channels in the rock. Take the short hike to the area below the falls and you'll be amazed how fast the raging torrents turn into a peaceful little bay.\"This is a lovely place to visit..very pretty..but there is only so long you can ooh and aah for !!! Have seen other falls as well\"The Athabasca Falls is a must see if you are in Jasper! It is really only accessible to see in the late spring, summer and early fall months of the year. It is closed in the winter for your safety as the road offers poor driving conditions in the winter months. This is wonderful spot for photographers - with the majestic mountain background, the flowing Athabasca River that leads to the falls, the sweeping deep canyons formed over the years and the hard rushing falling water makes your images ones you will treasure forever. You can drive here yourself or you can take a bus tour to get here. It is better if you can drive yourself as then you can take your time at the falls. Also, driving on your own you can then drive to the nearby \"\"Meeting Of The Waters\"\" which is where the Whirlpool River meets the Athabasca River. As the waters meet rushing side by side - one side is crystal clear and clean while the other side is muddy. There are many little places to stop and see along the way if you drive on your own to the Athabasca Falls - and if you have the time and continue along highway 93 or even highway 93A you can visit Lake Louise for the day. So much beauty to take in to the Athabasca Falls and from the Athabasca Falls. Enjoy!\"This is well worthwhile. The scenery and the roar of the falls one of Jasper parks nice (and noisy) attractions.\"This is another example of nature creating an exceptional and transforming way for water to travel. The formations and crevices, magnified by the unusual color of the water, create magnificent art to enjoy right by the parking lot. Take time to enjoy and walk down by the canyon as well.\"Driving from Jasper to Banff this was one of our first stops and defiantly one of the high lights! With many viewing points the waterfall drops away violently into the canyon and exits a calm pale stream. Truly breath taking.\"We visited these falls trowards the end of a cold, snowy day and this added to the drama. That said, the water colour was a stunning sapphire blue. The Falls are easily accessible from the car park which is itself, just off of the Icefields Parkway. I wish I could remember the name of the mountain on the opposite side of the Parkway but the imposing presence of this added to the atmosphere.\"Beautiful falls right off the Iceburg Parkway and easy to walk to. Worth stopping to see and enjoy the sights!!Must be able to manage a few steps. Salutary lesson about previous casualties at the falls. Liked the peace and quiet of the lower canyonThe falls are fearsome and demonstrate the power of nature. Be sure to walk down the trail of the old path of the falls to see how the water originally flowed and look back up across to the bridge to see how high up you are from the falls.There is quite the view of this waterfall. Amazing how much water can shape the land and rocks around it. Take a walk down the path to see all the sites\"I loved the sound it made, in early summer it must be absolutely deafening. There were also lots of squirrels around\"\"This is easily accessible and has several bridges that allow different vantages of the falls. It has ample parking and can be busy when tour buses pull into the parking lot. There are several view points along the route, though, and some great photo ops.\"\"Lots of people know about this place, just off the Hwy, lots of parking available, a smaller falls but lots of power and great trails to see it all. Take pictures!\"\"This one gorgeous falls. It was in the Fall when I arrived, I would love to see it in the Spring when runoff occurs.\"\"Got beautiful photos here, even with the mountains hidden in clouds, the falls are still pretty. Somewhat crowded with buses and large tour groups though.\"Take tour time when visiting Athabasca Falls. There are so many nooks and diversions with numerous viewpoints that it is hard not to miss at least some of them. The falls are gorgeous (excuse the pun)! We started off in cloudy weather and had to redo all the photography stuff when eventually the sun broke through.\"stunning beauty all around!! right off the parkway. great views of the river and mountains.part of the trail from the parking lot to the falls is paved.\"This was just part of a spectacular day travelling between banff and Jasper. We'll worth seeing and a memory which will live with me forever\"During our trip thru the mountains, we stopped to visit the Athabasca Falls. We are certainly glad we did. It was fall and the air was crisp and smelled amazing. Loved the hike to get to see the falls and could have stayed and gazed at them for hours. It was great being there off season as there were not hordes of people to contend with. Tons of great photo opportunities!! I encourage anyone travelling in the area to stop at the Athabasca Falls. Loved it!!!\"\"A two hour visit, with the river forcing itself through a devils cauldron and carving a canyon through to the other side. Well laid out for tourists to visit all aspects.\"\"Water floe is don this year, End of Sept. Have stopped there several time, good stop. The falls are always interesting, even with lower water flow.\"\"We spent almost an hour here walking around, taking pictures, and looking at all the beauty of the fall. Definitely worth the stop. No strenuous hiking required.\"\"We took the trail along the canyon. At the bridge, it was hard to see the water because the canyon is so narrow, and the river is a long way down. The falls are beautiful, and well worth the short hike.\"was on the list and could see this was rated on TA. It was on the way from/to Jasper but we made the trip on the way from jasper to calgary. This place is easy to locate and just 200 meters from the highway and the falls is just right next to the parking lot. came here and was amazed - took the usual photos and off on our way along the IP. we probably took 30 mins max staying at this place (sadly during our week it was getting chilly [end of sept] so you just want to take photos and get out of there lol so I would say during summer time would be nice to hang around and have lunch here or a snack)Athabasca Falls is located in the Jasper National Park. The falls were formed by the water over many thousands of years. The trail along the river is well worth the visit. One portion of the trail goes through a slot that was abandoned by the water many years ago. The rock formations along the wall are very interesting. The trail is not suited for strollers or wheelchairs. Also water your young children as the water is running fast and one of the benches along the trail is dedicated to a young man that slipped and fell into the water. The tour buses stop here so go early to avoid the crowds.This is an easy walk to view the falls and they are worth the walk. You can actually climb down the trail through parts of the canyon to the river and perhaps get lucky and see white water rafters. This canyon engages you to imagine the water rushing through here thousands of years ago and it shows what strength water has. Don't be afraid to get wet at the actual falls as water sprays high into the air. A must see on the Jasper Parkway.\"Check it out! Even my 2 year old thought that the falls were fantastic!! You really do not have to walk too far, to be able to see the falls!\"The falls were quite fierce...we took this on put way from Lake Louise to Jasper.... kids were quite excited.Lots of good view points to see different angles of the falls. Well worth exploring them all. This is not far from jasper.These falls were one of the highlights of our trip to Canada. They are beautiful to behold and there are lots of information plaques to read about how they were formed. The water is so blue.Beautiful and great for photos. Short walk around worth the great views. You can even build your own inukshuk down at the lower lake. Stunning and a sight you won't forget\"Loud in places, bit of a spray. Nice views. plenty of visitors.Plenty of viewing platforms all around.\"\"If you haven't seen Athabasca falls you're missing out on a great attraction. I've seen them about 5 times in my life, the first time when I was a child of 7yrs old. It's a must see,you'll enjoy it.\"\"If you are travelling along the Icefield Parkway, it is worth taking a short stop en route to visit the Athabasca Falls, which in late September are not too busy.\"\"Worth a look although it is busy, lots of tourists, coaches etc. we did the walk around and down the the lower falls as it is good to stretch your legs.\"\"It's worth the hike to see the falls. There are many beauty spots in The Rockies, but this is one of those that's worth a detour!\"The falls have carved out a very interesting route though the rocks. We found them full and rushing. The drop off toward the river was narrow and steep. It's amazing what water over time can create. Worth a stop.\"A neat stop, well suited to tourists and geologists alike. Lots of designated viewing areas, well thought out.\"\"This one has to be seen. Cascading massive falls coming from the Athabasca Glacier. A walkway around makes viewing safe for all, although it can be crowded at busy times.\"\"Amazing falls / canyon - a must see if passing through this area.Parking is close to the falls so not a long walk - there are also pathways all around the area so it's easy to walk round and take in the spectacular views.\"\"One of the falls on Ice Parkway. Nice roaring water fall in summer.Should visit if you are on Ice parkway.\"\"Wonderful sight and must be done as part of any visit to Western Canada.Highly recommended.We were very impressed at the natural washrooms in every sightseeing spot in the National Parks.\"The Athabasca Falls are magnificent and one of the many spots we always take our Alberta visitors to. For the most part the walking is easy but there is a lower view which can be challenging to anyone not steady on their feet.If you are visiting Jasper don't miss this wonder of nature.How can water falling give you such a good feeling? This is a stunning area near Jasper. Wonderful place.\"If we were to advise someone going to Jasper for the first time, we'd tell you not to miss this. It's close to the freeway, doesn't require any hiking to see it, and it is absolutely spectacular.\"one of the many stops you can take while driving along the icefield parkway. a nice trail leads to the fallls. the falls is great for photographs.\"It is not signed very well from the parking lot, but follow the sound of the water. You view the falls from a number of angles. The paths are paved and the walk is not too strenuous, even the walk back up. You can follow the canyon down to a beach area where people have built several inikshuks.\"This place is a must when in the area. Lots of viewing areas. Beautiful area to walk around. I have never seen anything so amazing. Not to be missed.Absolutely worth viewing. It would have stood out more as an amazing sight if we had not have tried to cram so much into one day of taking in such incredible geological wonders. Wish we had more time to spread it out. Try to do so.\"These are beautiful falls. Just off the road and crowded, but well worth a stop. There are many places around the falls to get many varied views.\"A must visit just to see the power of the water. Lovely on a hot day with the must spraying on your face. A nice walk to the bottom to the 'pebble beach' where you can build your own Inuksuk!\"Not well signed off the Parkway, so keep a lookout. We nearly missed it and we were keeping an eye out for the turnoff when driving southbound.It's approximately 35 km south of Jasper. Lots of parking. Superb views of the falls and river from the walkways. We got there about 09.30 and the car park was empty. We had the place to ourselves. Great views of the Athabasca river. The water over the first set of falls was in full flow and we could hear the roar from the car park. The river has cut lots of interesting shapes into the rock, some of which it has now abandoned and which you can walk through. Fabulous - and free..\"\"Be sure to visit here, the hike to the Glaciers (two) is moderate, maybe a little steep, but I am 78 and made it so you can. It is worthwhile\"Good attraction but long walk if you are not a bus or invalid. Walk if steep and hard for the unfit so if you are aged or unfit go up to the next car park and the walk from here is just a short walk.A must-see stop along the Icefields Parkway. The wide river funnels into a very narrow rock canyon that has some unusual forms and shapes. Good walk-ways and overlooks are provided.The loud roar and clouds of mist coming from the falls emphasizes how much power is being corralled by the rocks around these falls. Don't miss this attraction.\"This waterfall is one of the best places for a close up of falls. With the Rocky Mountains topping it, the scene is one of a kind. Between the trees the mountains and the falls appear as if they are a natural camera view. This is the second time for me to see it and never stopped being impressed.\"\"Athabasca Falls gives more bank for the buck than most other waterfall sites. It is easily accessible from the well-maintained parking lot. It is best viewed in the Fall, when there are far fewer tourists. Even so, the path is well marked with interpretive signs and the falls are amazing as they plunge over rocks and course through a steep canyon.\"\"Brilliant, best waterfall between Jasper and Banff, definitely worth a stop whilst on the Icefields parkway\"\"Beautiful, powerful - lots of energy!! We were very close to the falls - closer than you can get at Niagara. You really get the sense of the power because of the closeness. Worth seeing!!!\"Typical Canadian scenery well organised and well worth the visit. Its not Niagara but still an amazing sight.These falls were running very fast when we visited and the flow was impressive. The track was well maintained and lookouts situated in some good places. Truly another marvel of Mother Nature.\"Have stopped here over 100 times, and never get tired of it. Looks amazing in every weather, any season. Make sure to follow the path down to the river! (turn right after you crossed the bridge)\"First week of September still great flow of water. Can't imagine how it must look in spring and early summer! Pathways and overlooks well maintained.\"its not as big as niagra falls (not even close), but you do get to see the falls up close without having to get on a boat and sail towards it. its is a convenient accessible site.\"\"Me and my fiance stopped by, as we were staying at Whistler's campground in Jasper. Its about a 30 minute scenic drive from their. She thought that the falls were a little boring but I thought they were beautiful. We only spent five-ten minutes at the falls and were able to see from all the vantage points. Make sure you were an extra layer if you want to stay for a while because it cools down around the falls.\"Definitely worth the stop and the very short walk to the view. It is very popular so you don't feel like you're off the beaten track but you should not miss is.cool mountain water rushing over rocks and cliffs....thrilling! careful that you wear good shoes as it can get slippery with the spray of water. there is hand rails so you can get great photos!\"Okay place to see some fall, but not something I would put at the top of our list. Better to hike somewhere and see some of the remote falls\"\"One of the most beautiful falls I have ever seen. Easy access to the site off of the main highway into Jasper. Don't miss this if you are in the area. Parts of the area are handicapped accessible, but most are not. Plan on spending at least 30 minutes here as some of the most spectacular sites are when you cross over the bridge to the other side of the falls. The fast flow of water is amazing.\"\"look at the rock formation and the canyon, to see the force of nature and power of water. This is easily accessible, large body of water fall, good paths to walk along, and even somewhat hidden picnic tables just upstream that we totally missed and settled for the picnic area next to parking lot.Next time, I'll walk 100 ft upstream and spend an hour eating my sandwich lunch box there.Certainly not Niagara, but this is the best one in Banff-Jasper corridor.\"The Athabasca Falls were beautiful. We spent some time hiking and then just sitting and enjoying the sound of the rushing water. We took some great pictures. There were alot of people but the sound of the water keeps the area quiet and you really don't hear people talking.\"Very scenic and a camera is a must, however, there are chipmunks that throw pine cones at you (seriously) :-)\"\"Well worth a visit. The falls are very deceptive initially but up close are quite spectacular. The cost is .... well free! Go early and there are very few people but the sun is shining into your lens. Later in the day may be better for photos. Either way, they are well worth a visit.\"\"Not quite Niagara, but these are impressive falls nonetheless, and they provide some excellent photo opportunities.\"\"You really see the power of water here. The falls drops to a gorge and swirls around in a dance of beauty. Once again it,s great to see that Alberta is not greedy and the charge is $0.00. The surounding mountains make this a perfect spot to see the power of God,s creation\"Worth getting up early so you can get there before the crowds. Take a little time to go to all the viewpoints and then walk down to the bottom. The walk down is stairs cut into the old path of the falls so pretty cool to see up close the channels cut.\"If you're on the Icefields Parkway, you'd be foolish to skip this. Falls are beautiful; accessible. Rainbow when the sun is shining through the mist. The walk down to the bottom is easy and it's fun to walk through the \"\"old\"\" canyon.\"\"Maybe we are spoiled having seen Niagara, or some of the fantastic falls in Iceland such as Gullfoss but we were all complete underwhelmed by these falls. Are they nice ? Yes. Does the whirlpool current at the base create interesting circular erosion patterns ? yes. Does all the walk ways stink of stale urine ? yes, which is disgusting as Jasper National Park is full of bathrooms. Anyway, if you are driving by these falls why wouldn't you go look at them. But in our humble opinion, and we maybe have been spoiled by other falls in the world, these falls are small and Jasper has much more to offer.\"\"This is a powerful waterfall, not like most of what you see coming down the high mountains. You see it as it drops over a huge gorge it has created. & is really unusual. You have to walk a little but it was worth it.\"Not everyone who visits the Rockies is a considerate traveller. The ease of getting to Athabasca Falls is offset by the shear number of tourists which can make the experience less enjoyable. Try not to visit on a long weekend or get there before 10 am. Be sure to cross the pedestrian bridge as views from the far side are compelling. Thankfully there are picnic tables in the parking lot (though not many of them) so it's a nice place to stop for lunch.\"Nice walking trails to view the falls from many vantage points. A nice, quick and easy stop to incorporate in your day.\"\"I loved it and this was about my 3rd visit there. Great location for people with mobility issues, the paths are all paved but there are some stairs if you want to go further on the path.\"\"Although it is not a very high waterfall, its force is amazing. The walk is easy, even for small children, and very scenic.\"\"Don't miss out on seeing this attraction. Truly beautiful. It can get very busy here, so I'd suggest visiting the falls in the early morning.\"\"We were exhausted from hiking but were still able to walk down and see the falls. Paved walkways, close views, nice bridges, and really designed for tourists.\"\"It's only a short drive off the Icefields Parkway so why not check it out? For us it was a one-time deal. There were large, annoying crowds of people watching water tumble over some rocks into a deep channel. It was OK for a waterfall.\"Worth the 30 - 45 mins it takes to see the attraction. Stay on the pathways and you'll get some great photos.Easy to get to and very accessible to all. These are very nice falls and well presented with the layout of the paved trail. Nice although it was very busy which I suspect is usually the case.\"Go early in the morning to avoid the crush of people, but the amazing nature at her best is on display. Close by some great trails for hiking too.\"Loved this place - our first stop-off on the drive from Jasper to Banff. Not very well signposted but really worth an hour's visit to explore the wonders of these amazing waterfalls and gorge.\"These falls are striking, just off the Icefields Parkway and a stop here provides a nice break on your drive between Lake Louise and Jasper.\"These were smaller but seemed just as powerful as Niagara Falls and you get to go right up to it! Great experience. Made the entire Jasper detour from Banff worth it alone.\"We enjoyed visiting Athabasca Falls and walking the different trails. This is one place the tourist buses come so it was a bit crowded but was still worth the visit. After walking the standard route to the falls, we took the stairs through the gorge down to the river and then walked about ten minutes along the river bank. There are other trails that go along the river before the falls that we walked. The best thing to do if you have an hour or two is to get away from the main falls and take the trails to see the sights and the river.\"\"This was a great spot. The falls and the resulting canyons were very cool. Stay away from the edge, we saw a bench dedicated to a young man who lost his life falling in the falls - interesting but sad.Definitely worth a stop if your on the Icefield's highway.\"Beautiful falls with easy access for all ages. Walking a bit further than the first bridge is worth the small hike down and back.This place is a must-see if you are anywhere in the area of Jasper. It is amazing! You will not regret spending time here.I don't know how many times I am going to say this about attractions around Japer but another must see absolutely beautifulbeautiful! will take your breath away.I liked everything about this! Would definately go see this attractionagain.\"Alright... there are water falls all over, but not many like one. It seemed like just another place we ought to stop, but it was well worth an hour, The rock formations and the raging water are breath taking. This is worth a whole camera chip. It is difficult to know when to stop taking photos.\"\"The Falls are well worth the stop, seeing a wide river narrowed into a 10' wide cut in the rock. You will be able too see the falls from 3-4 different angle and they are breath taking. A path trails along the channel below the falls about a 1/4 mile to where the river widen again to continue it trip to the Arctic ocean. Don't miss the fantastic experience right off the Ice Fields Parkway.\"\"If you like waterfalls, rainbows, river and mountain scenery and interesting rocks this is the place for you.\"The power and beauty is second to none. Fabulous photo ops and well planned walking areas. You could spend hours wandering and never getting bored of the beauty around you.\"Come early in Summer and on a weekday if you can. If you leave Jasper around 9am, you will get there before any crowds and have the place almost to yourself.\"This was well served by a large car and coach park and there are viewing areas in several places around the top of the falls and as you walk down through the old channels to the river below. The power of the water and the never-ending flow are just wonderful to watch!\"Make sure you stop off to see this attraction ,a 5 minute walk from the car park and the noise and sight of rushing water through the rock canyon is spectacular, another short walk to the foot of the falls leads you to a large opening to the river with far reaching views.\"\"The falls are more complex than I expected. There were many different vantage points for viewing from different angles. A bit of exercise rewards one with even more sights, well worth it!\"Very pretty rainbow over the falls. Have seen bigger and better but this was very nice. It only took a few minutesb ut was well worth the trip.always a great stop. well worth seeing. impressive and beautiful. the falls are amazing and the walking paths and viewing platforms and veru well done.This is a great experience and an easy to get to place with superb walkways etc. The parking and 'long drop' toilets are good. Providing you stay on the walkways the whole experience is safe and gives one a memorable trip out. whilst you are in the area ride up to Mount Edith Cavell and see the beautiful Angel Glacier.\"During our stay in Jasper one of the great spots we visited was the Athabasca Falls. They are quite interesting and lovely to look at. The Athabasca River pours into a narrow canyon that it has carved out over hundreds of years and one can feel the power of the water as it gushes through. Just to the side of it there is another canyon where the river many years ago used to go through. A long time ago it must have found a weaker spot and started carving through there so now the old canyon sits dry. Makes one wonder if somewhere under that torrent of water another weaker spot in the rock is being slowly worn away to eventually form another new canyon of the future.Great falls to visit with not far to walk from the carpark. We had a picnic lunch there, beautifull spot, one to visit for sure\"This is an excellent place to take kids or your elders to see falls. The walk is a very short jaunt from the parking lot and the views are spectacular! Definitely a must see if your are in the Jasper area!\"I love waterfalls and this didn't fail to please....worth a visit. Great scenery, deep gorges and plunging water.\"\"There are a number of water falls in Jasper and Banff National Parks. However, this is one of the most breath taking. Do not miss it!\"\"Peaceful, relaxing and beautiful. We took a bunch of photos andthey turned our awesome. Would visit again.\"A very special place due to the physics with the river and the canyon it's created. Not many you can drive to in Alberta like this one.\"Well worth a stop, make sure you wander round it in all directions, the power and beauty of this is awesome\"Been here several times and always stop to take another look. The falls and surrounding area are beautiful and the way in which the water sculpts the surrounding rock is fascinating including in one area where you can walk down into a chasm that was carved by water than no longer flows through that area. There are several walkways and viewpoints that enhance the experience so well done on that front with the only negative being the same as always in the mountain parks - crowds in the summer - unavoidable and can't blame anyone - so enjoy the falls.\"The fall itself and the presentation of it, meaning the explanations and all, was really good. I would recommend all to stop by a take the easy trail to see the falls. Especially when we went, a lot of water so it made the falls a sight to see.You have got to see it!\"Such a lovely place. The river sweeps round and then tumbles down a gorge it has cut in the rock. The observation places are very good. Car parking is easy and it is close to the highway.In the vicinity of Jasper Tramway (approx. 20km away) and a such beautiful natural wonder. Perfect for all ages.To see a substantial river flow over a fall and squeeze through a narrow gorge is an awe inspiring sight. The viewing areas are safe with good sight-lines to the rapids above and the gorge below as well as the falls themselves. Although the parking lot was pretty full there is room enough for people to spread out and take time to enjoy this spectacle of nature.You need a parks pass but there is no separate fee for the falls\"The area is so well kept ... read all the signs, the history and development of the falls. Its amazing!\"Not much to say go see it! There are all kinds of beautiful in nature and this is a gem in the Jasper area.Short drive from Jasper are the incredible Athabasca falls. Awesome display of nature and the power it holds. Well worth the visit!\"We drove to Athabasca Falls one morning from Jasper via 93A. The scenery on the way is great, and the falls are impressive. It's a good idea to get there early before the crowds. There are outdoor privies in the parking lot--they don't smell great but are no worse than those at other scenic stops.\"Just the best waterfall and so easy to access from the road... Took fantastic photos and enjoyed uninterrupted views of the water pounding through the narrow rocky pass from the bridge and the easy walkway.Raw power of nature in the wild. It's incredible to think that these falls have been there for hundreds of years.Some of the most exciting things you will see in Jasper National Park are the falls carving out deep gorges. This drop in the Athabasca River is a well maintained interpretive trail with many overlooks on the river falls and into the deep gorge it carves. It is a great stop. And short hike.Worth stopping by but bathrooms smelled horribly. Bring your camera and don't be scared to go down step to lower level.\"Worth stopping to see, it is just off the highway. Great for picture taking or just to relax and watch the falls.\"The falls were quite convenient to the Icefields Parkway and we had the pleasure of seeing a small black bear browsing in the bushes along the access road. There is adequate parking and the trails are well-designed for the average photographer.Lots of people around but that doesn't stop one being able to enjoy the spectacular falls and pleasant walksWe visited the falls on a Saturday and it was busy....but the grounds are large enough to spread out the guests so it has a less crowded feel. Parks Canada has down an excellent job of constructing walkways and decks to maximize the access to and views of the falls without obstrcuting the natural apppearance of the falls. They are quite something...they remind me a little of the Rhine Falls in Schauffhausen Switzerland. I would have gone back for a second visit but time did not allow. Parking was no problem. The rainbow in the fall mist was a special treat. We got some great pics that may be enlarged and hung on walls here at home.It's a short hike on a well marked path to visit the falls - you can get very close on both sides by crossing a bridge. We were very happy that we included this on our day trip from Jasper.The power of these falls is something to behold! Some crazy people climbed over the protective railing to get a closer look - something I would not recommend! (Those who have slipped into the water have not survived!) Worth walking to the lower level to look back at the canyon created by the water.\"This one is too easy to not miss! From the road you can see the mist from the falls, but have no idea of its power until you're up close!\"Beautiful falls albeit small in comparison to Something like Niagara. Great photo opportunities and scenery is beautiful. Definitely worth visiting.When the river is high as it was when I visited the force of the water falling in such a small space is almost frightening. There is not much walking to see the attraction and it is worth a stop.Fantastic scenery and no need to hike for hours to get there. It does get crowded in the summer though;\"These are incredible waterfalls easily accessible from road that should not be missed. After long day of driving, it's great to get out and experience the beauty in person (but having bug spray helps).\"Tremendous falls well worth taking the time to see. The falls come from the Athabasca Glacier and have a lot of water going over them in the springtime. The surroundings are pretty too.Do not miss this amazing place which is easily accessible from car park. We loved seeing the power of the water.\"breath taking views and hikes down the falls.Make sure to take all routes around the falls as there are different views at each location\"\"The falls are not far from Jasper and an absolute highlight on a sunny day. Then, the water is crystal clear and with a light-blue shine, just breathtaking. There are walkways around the lower end of the falls as well to the base, offering a great many photo opportunitie.\"This was one of our favorites in Jasper National Park. The waterfall was strong and powerful and we saw a beautiful rainbow right on top of the waterfall. We also enjoyed the nice little hike. There is a lot of see here!\"We drove from Jasper to the Falls but missed it because there was no signs. They only put signs for people drove from Banff to the Falls not the other way.If you passed Mt. kerkeslin, then you passed the Falls.\"Very dramatic falls where you can see the action close up. It's a short walk from parking lot making it an easy to tour.\"The falls are very nice and many boards explain its formation but as it is accessed from the highway, pretty much everyone stops there for a while and it is very crowded.You can cross on the other side of the falls to get really close and get some refreshing spray from the falls, the kids loved getting a bit wet!\"\"A beautiful stop, right off the Ice Fields Parkway. Don't miss this and keep driving by. You could spend 5 minutes or an hour here, there were a few trails and different vantage points. The falls are magnificient.The infrastructure could maybe use a bit of upkeep, but parks infrastructure isn't a priority of our current government.Parking in the main lot was busy, but there was an upper, RV kind of lot that had lots of room if needed.\"\"Absolutely beautiful falls with water carved channels!A bit crowded at one point but the tour bus didnt stay too long.\"\"Were with a trip and this was one of the stopovers. It was amazing, we went on to the Glacier - a must if in the area.\"We stop here each time we come to Jasper regardless of the season. Always impressive. Phenomenal amount of water. Make sure to stop and check it out.I've now visited the Athabasca Falls twice. Both times the stop was well worth it. On this occasion we were also lucky enough to see a black bear. The kids enjoyed the break from driving and the walking around. Some great photos at this location and the information posted is also very good.\"This is by far the most impressive of the waterfalls in the Rockies and you can certainly see why it is the No 1 attraction. About 30 mins south of Jasper on the Icefields Parkway. The power of the water is incredible and the sink holes it has created; the rock formations are impressive. The river before them is also very pretty.Much of the area is paved and mostly accessible by wheelchair, but there is a further walk down by steps and trails. You should take a jacket as it was much cooler down there at the beginning of July.This is one you should make a point of visiting if you are on the Parkway.Hole in the ground style toilets - need baby wipes.\"\"when you are driving down the icefields parkway, this is certainly a must do stop, the waterfall is amazing and one of the biggest I've seen so far. When you are driving from jasper take 93a if you want to see some wildlife, if you're driving from lake louise take the exit to Athabasca Falls and drive the 93a to jasper if you want to see some wildlife ;)\"Wonderful attraction very close to parking. They have done an excellent job melding tourist accommodations (Pathways etc) and the beautiful rock formations and waterways of the Athabasca Falls.Recent rain made for an incredible water flow -- rainbow and all. Our photo touring group captured the area with videos and images. Worth the stop.the all around scenery was beautiful and many different areas to look at and see the view. The mist off of the falls was very refreshing and the pictures that we took were great as we saw a double rainbow from the mist and the way the sun hit it.Great Falls and walking paths. Loved it! the view is fantastic and there are lots of great photo opportunitiesWonderful falls close to Jasper and a definite stop on the Icefields Parkway. Amazing how the water has carved out the shapes in the rocks. Easy access to different viewpoints. It can be busy but you can still reach all the viewpoints.\"The falls are impressive,only short and easy stroll to get to them. Seeing the previous pathway of the water is a unique experience.\"\"When you're driving down the Icefields Parkway, make sure you do a quick stop at the Athabasca Falls. Watching the water thunder down the chasm, seeing the sprays and the rainbows...amazing!\"\"The Athabasca Falls were different from every angle, quite mysterious & very scary..difficult to get a photo that truly depicted the power of these falls.\"\"Very powerful falls, right off the main road. It's nice to walk down to the canyon and see the alternate route the river used to take. The short walk ends at a calm part of the river with a beautiful view\"The Athabasca Falls are a must see in Jasper. The pathways around the falls are well maintained and easy to walk on. We were able to see the falls from every angle. Visitors are able to get informed on the history and other interesting points by reading many large info boards along the way. We were glad we made the effort to see them.\"This is a definite must see, just seconds off the highway about 1/2 hour south of Jasper. Paved pathways and bridges allow you to see the water pounding through the narrow gorge. Especially impressive when the water is running high.\"we only had an hour and were glad we stopped here. beautiful falls - and pathway through former falls where you can see how the water carved through the rocks.\"Athabasca falls are not very high, but are very powerful. The site offers a very nice paved trail alongside and over the falls, allowing them to be seen top left and right, across, and bottom right. The trail has panels which explain the falls and the way they developed, as well as the impact on vegetation. There is even a walk down a canyon that used to be part of the falls which shows a large pothole. The water sprays in places which is refreshing on a summer day, but also makes the pathway slippery in places. Allow 45 minutes for the visit.\"These falls are spectacular. Be sure and see them for all advantages. Have been all over US and Europe and have seen many falls. These falls are only rivaled by some falls we saw in Switzerland that had 9 falls inside of a mountain!\"Amazing, wild waterfalls. You can get really close to them and they are awesome. The water was high due to the recent rains.\"This is a nice photo op but not much else since being right alongside the parkway you get scores of tour buses disgorging themselves from time-to-time which is annoying as most don't even speak English\"These are magnificent falls that can be viewed from a variety of positions. In addition, there is a trail through the trees - a good relief from the bright sunshine - but watch out for the mozzies. There are a number of points of information along the way that add interest to the walk. In places the spray from the falls reaches the paths so appropriate footwear is probably a good idea. Don't miss these falls when driving the Icefield Parkway.\"\"Only 30 minutes away from Jasper the waterfalls are quite spectacular. The power of the water is astonishing and you should definitely walk down the steps to the pot hole and the canyon. If you go to the other side of the bridge and look at the falls from the right side, there is usually a beautiful rainbow which really must be admired.\"\"Spectacular views!Easy trail from parking lot to falls. Not too busy Definitely worth the stop.Recommended for the whole family.\"There are many different levels to view the falls from and provides some great pictures. Wear appropriate shoes as most of the trails have water from the falls.Unbelievably beautiful. Words cannot describe how gorgeous this is. To be able to see a waterfall from start to finish is incredible. The information cards located along the walkways are very informative.\"There's nothing to dislike, unless you're too lazy to actually walk around and enjoy what this wonderful site has to offer.\"\"Good stop if you need to cover some distance but still want to see some things. Quick to hike into, about 10-15min. Really nice in the fall\"\"Loved the falls, they were beautiful, just wish it wasn't so chilly outside so we could enjoy them longer!\"\"If you are not blown away by the awesome spectacle and power of the Athabasca Falls, don't visit the Canadian Rockies!\"Great day trip from Jasper...we did it by Mountain Bike and truly enjoyed the scenery and the area. Saw a bear on the way... made the trip exciting.\"I'm used to paddling the top white-water rivers in the UK.This takes it to another level - not the most beautiful of falls (the review of Maligne Canyon still to come) but definitely the most impressive in terms of scale.\"\"Overall, Jasper is gorgeous. Athabasca falls are not too far from the city of Jasper, and they're easy to find. The falls themselves are not like Niagara Falls, but they are a different kind of beauty, with charm and very fitting for the mountains. Especially with the mountain backdrop ! There is a concrete path going around there so it's easy to get around. That and there are information signs telling you the history and info on the falls. You need to see the falls if you come to Jasper!\"\"Vey pretty, easy access and we saw BEARS three times between Jasper and the falls. A real highlight!\"\"These falls are great in that there are multiple ways to access them either by day hike, or by car if you aren't so inclined. Very pic worthy.\"just off the highway and mulitple viewing locations for some great falls. easy to get to and worth the short drive.\"Definitely plan a stop off here if you are driving along Hwy 93, there is lots of parking, really good access, and the falls themselves are very impressive. At the base of the falls is a large pool area with lots of boulders for kids...More\"It is well worth stopping to have a look at these falls. It is only a short walk to the first bridge and you can continue walking if you want\"I wasn't expecting to be so close to the waterfall - it was wonderful to feel the cool air movement and fine mist, caused by the immense power of the water crashing through the surrounding rocks. The information boards were fascinating and the whole area is a hikers delight. Great place to visit.I had to deduct one point, however, because the worst public toilets in Jasper National Park are on this site. All the others around the park are relatively clean, well serviced with loo paper and hand sanitizer, and they do not smell. Not so at Athabasca Falls and the smell inside the cabins was terrible. Don't be put off visiting the Falls because they are fabulous - just use the toilets en route, further down the road leading to the attraction.\"Easy to reach from the highway and accesible for all. Perfect place to take a picture while in Canada.\"can't describe the beauty of the falls , while gazing the athabasca falls with its water flowing the stairway sculptured rocks, a view of the beautiful multi- colored mountain also captured your attention.\"\"There are many viewpoints with minimal walking. We went during a period where there appeared to be a few tour buses stopped, however with a short walk we escaped the crowds and got a good view of the falls.\"\"The fall is just amazing, as good as Niagara but on a smaller scale. The walk down the canyon is worth the trip too.\"Athabasca falls is a fantastic stop on the Icefield Parkways. The water is so fast and loud and the gorge is mesmerising to look at! It's only a short walk to it from the car park which was handy. There are a good few nice little walks around too.I loved seeing Sumwapta Falls but then just a short time later we stopped at Athabasca Falls and that just topped the trip! I'd highly recommend stopping in and hiking around. There are several trails and lots of information about Athabasca Falls along the way. You really get a sense of just how powerful water is when you see the deeply gouged canyons. Definitely worth the trip!The spray from the thundering waterfalls was extremely refreshing on the day we visited. The double rainbows that could be seen in the spray were absolutely stunning. Make sure to make the stop and take in all its magnificence!This site is well worth the stop as well and make sure you take pictures as it is a falls to remember.The river was full making the falls more powerful than normal. Good to go in an evening but use mosquito repellent first!easy to get to and so beautiful ; one of the biggest falls that I have seen in a while so close up to it. you can walk in and stand on the bridge to feel the mist. you are looking over to it and down on it rather than up at it. A refreshing and free vista to put on your list when entering or leaving Jasper.Very impressive. Nice easy hike to see several different views. We didn't have a lot of time and were told this was a must see. Glad we took the time\"a nice thing to see when in the area. free access, quiet place for pique nique. paclards along the trails to explain phenomenon.\"I was biking by (from the States) and only decided to pull in to the Athabasca Falls at the last minute. Wow!\"Don't go out of your way to visit but if you are driving south of Jasper towards Banff, make this a half hour break, take your camera and go for a walk and enjoy the falls. Watch out for the busloads of Asian tourists who are swarming with their cameras, wanting their own private shots but not concerned about walking in front of your shots. Just go with it and enjoy the sights and the spray on a warm day.\"\"Well worth a visit, it makes you wonder where all the water is going, it does this every day of the year continually. A natural wonder in every way\"A must see. Impressive trail and bridges bring you close to this powerful waterfall. Amazing views. Worth the visit!!\"We stopped here for 20 minutes to stretch our legs and enjoy the fresh air. The falls are impressive and there are viewing platforms at various levels. You can see the sheer power of the water as it crashes through, and information signs tell the history of how the falls were created and ever-changing. A good discovery and one I would recommend seeing!\"Simply magnificent. Be certain to go down to the outflow where it opens out into a serene river and watch for the small animals that call this area home.\"Very impressive falls with great walking trails built around it. The falls are very close and very powerful, great way to witness the forces of nature (awe inspiring). Not the tallest falls but the volume of water and strength of the falls make up for that. Walk around the trails and you can get over to a rock beach where my kids built a little rock sculpture (others had already done some).\"A first stop of many on a day long coach journey from Jasper to Banff and only a short distance from the highway. A short easy walk brings you to the falls and there are viewing platforms at various heights to see the cascade from different angles. Well worth the stop and we could have stayed longer but the coach itinerary did not permit this unfortunately. Look out for orchids!. They are easy to miss. We found a few clumps of lovely mauve ones in full flower - it was the beginning of June.The falls are breathtaking and it definitely shows how powerful mother nature is. A definite must see when visiting Jasper.\"The falls are fantastic! I wish we could have only stayed longer! A definite MUST see!Everything you could ever imagine with such a powerful waterfall!\"\"If you are driving past, take 20 minutes out and stop off here.

Wonderful photos to be takenTry and get there early before the coach parties arrive en-masse\"\"The scenery in the Rockies is spectacular overall and the Athabasca Falls, along with the many other waterfalls in the area, are no exception.\"This is an amazing place to visit. We visited Maligne Canyon the previous day so we had a good appreciation of how the canyons form etc. The track here is much shorter than Maligne Canyon and can be done in 20 minutes or so. You walk through a canyon and you can view the falls and the river from a number of viewing platforms. The falls are beautiful and the power of the water is quite spectacular. Well worth stopping for.Take the stairs down to the bottom of the falls and enjoy the rocky shoreline and whitewater rafters starting their journeyAmazing power of water!!! Easy to find with good parking. the falls were in full force in June due to melt water and the noise was thunderous.\"We were thrilled with the noise, spray, depth, force, view. Pictures do not do it justice. A must see on your trip to Jasper National Park. Wheelchair accessible. Picnic tables available. Bathroom facilities.\"\"You must visit the falls if you are in the area, they are massive with enormous volumes of water swirling down into the gorge below. There are a number of viewing platforms which give excellent views. Just astounding!\"Loved the sheer amazement of the Falls . Nature at its most powerful. The spray and roar of the water both excited and scared me! I have visions of this waterfall still in middle of night. So well worth a visit.\"Awesome falls, gorges and deep chasms. You can follow the river through a series of descents and walk a mile or so down the canyon. Each vista is different and beautiful.\"It is not a big fall but is nice Good opportunity for photo location. U can get quite close to the rapids.

There are lovely walks to enjoy around the area and the weather was sunny on the day we went there so this made our photos even more fantastic.The rain made the river higher than usual so the falls were quite spectacular. Easy to walk around. Go down to the bottom to see the river bend after the falls.A must go in Jasper ! One of the easiest treks...they have stairs going down into the gorge. Brilliant views for pictures especially if you have a sunny day !easy safe walk around dramatic falls. Helpful informative signs. Definitely worth stopping to walk around and see these exciting falls.Easy access to the parking lot from the highway. Definitely set aside about 45 minutes to explore the falls from the various bridges and lookout points. The views are amazing!These falls are definitely worth a visit. The look of the falls change as you walk around. It is busy but people don't stay in one location too long so you can move in for pictures.A very pretty area with some pretty dramatic views of the canyon and falls. Its an area worth visiting if you have the chance.Fantastic spot. We visited the week of the floods in Alberta so the river was very high and powerful and a bit mucky! Definitely worth a visit. Go for a little wander around the paths.Breathtaking falls. Easy walk from the car park and well constructed viewing points. The water (Spring flooding) was amazing - well worth stopping for an hour just to take it all in.\"This was our first stop driving from Jasper to Banff. It was easy to find, well signposted and a good size carpark.We visited in August and they were flowing fast. The force produced is spectacular.There are a number of viewing platforms and trails to follow around the falls. All give you a different view and they are all amazing!!\"Always popular and excellent picture taking opportunity. I wandered up another path and saw a reminder of why people should not try to get too close to the falls -- a personal memorial. The paths were easy to navigate and walk up/dn.\"The sheer volume of water crashing to the bottom every second is simply incredible! Don't just take photos here - they may be worth a thousand words, but video clips of the action are worth millions of words!!!\"It is a must! very well organized and very close to the parking. The falls are seen from all directions - fantastic!!!!We visited while it was drizzling and the falls were really beautiful. There's a trail from the car park that goes near the falls and it's a short walk only.\"Not a massive water-fall, but very impressive! Great photos from many aspects. Very beautiful area and easy to get to. Well signed.\"Don't drive past this one. They are spectacular. You can do a short walk or a long one. Lots of photograph opportunities.Great time to go mid June when the snow and ice melt gives a torrent of water that is truely an awesome sight. Very easy to get to but pathways may be not easily managed by some. An amazing display of the beauty and force of nature and all for free.These falls need some time to walk around the pathways to truly experience their beauty. Great picture opportunities. Make an effort to stop in. You won't be disappointed.\"Worth a stop off if passing, the falls were in full flow with the meltwater and there are good viewing points. My only criticism woud be the design of the walkways which seemed o be built in concrete and seemed at odds with the natural environment, design flaw maybe?\"\"Short walk to the falls, and beautiful picture opp's. Short drive from Jasper which was convenient as well.\"\"So much to see and do,many,many photo opportunities,good paths and information stops,easy walk from car park,the colour of the water in some parts of the falls is amazing\"\"Compared to most waterfalls, this one has an extensive (but accessible) trail network that allows you to see the falls from many different angles and even allows you to cross the river to see the falls from both sides. Definitely worth a stop if you are on the Icefields Parkway.\"Certainly a must see on any trip to Jasper - I was surprised at the large crowds as we hadn't seen a lot of people until this point in our trip. The falls are spectacular and you'd be missing something wonderful if you didn't stop. Easy to do this in 30-45 minutes and take it all in - bring the camera. We were disappointed in the number of people that did not respect the signs warning them to staff off the rocks and the number of people that climbed the fence.These falls are beautiful! The force of the water is amazing and the photos looked great with the mountains in the background.There are a number of great views plus information panels. You can see how the power of the Sunwapta River has carved through the rock.\"What a fabulous place. We took heaps of photos, and the combination of mountains, falls, rivers etc made it a must go to place. Our visit was topped off with a close encounter with several deer who, while wild, are obviously used to tourists on their patch.\"\"This is a beautiful waterfall and you can walk some trails to see it from various viewpoints. Since this is a Canadian National Park, you never pay entry fees to see the sites. Certainly well worth the stop.\"\"A must see site on Highway 93 from Banff to Jasper as the falls are formed on the Athabasca River in the form of an hour glass. The wide river narrows into a canyon at the falls and the rock carvings are created by the sand and gravel rubbing at high speed with the rock face and creating a deep crevice. The downstream side of the fall is also very beautifu, A must-see.\"\"Don't miss this place. See the beautifully carved rock canyon walls. Be astounded by the ongoing battle of rushing water against hard rocks. If you are short of time, a quick visit will take about 30 to 45 minutes..\"\n"

      "\"I always saw the sign along the highway but never stopped, thinking it was just another waterfall. When I finally stopped to see it I was amazed at how rugged and powerful it truly is. Don’t miss this glorious wonder of nature.\"\"I very pleasant spot and one that doesn't require much effort to visit.If you are into photography you might want to time your visit to catch the best light, early morning will mean that you are shooting into the sun.\"\"Can't see much of the fall, and it's kind of small. Also, slipped on the ice and bruised my left elbow, so be careful. Viewpoint was limited.\"\"The Athabasca Falls are just breathtaking in winter!There is parking just a few hundred meters away so it is safe to go there even when it’s snowing.Snow and ice just made it more pretty!\"\"Visited here in late October. The canyon and waterfall were beautiful - a variety of colours, textures. And the surroundings were very quiet. I spent 1 hour walking through the area and enjoying the view.\"The cliffs and the jagged edges were unbelievable. You good see layers of different times in the rocks. Wow a really good place to see.\"Food for thought: Go early. We had the unfortunate luck of arriving at the same time as ALL the tour buses... Needless to say there was scarce room to breathe, let alone enjoy the scenery. Nothing against the site in itself, it was just too people-y for me.\"\"Simply amazing!Please go and enjoy nature!Is a must!!Beautiful scenery!!Breath taking.Be ready to walk if you wanna see it all.\"This falls is about 25 km from Jasper and is worth a visit. A spectacular geological history cab be observed from this area.Absolutely breathtaking. Well worth the drive. Part of the Rockies at their best. Our second trip and would definitely go back again.\"The Athabasca falls are about 1/2 an hour outside of Jasper - easy to find and not a bad drive to get there. Lots of parking available, trails are well marked, and points of interest clearly identified.Once there, you are immersed in the natural beauty of the area. The falls are surrounded by rock outcroppings that really make you recognize how long this area has existed. There are multiple short trails to follow, each leading to interesting findings at the end. The falls are very impressive, and fast moving. Take a couple of hours to visit this site - you won't be disappointed.\"\"This is a must to visit, great views and an easy drive either in your own car or on an organised tour from the local hotels.Long or short walks to see the views. Ok for fit oldies like my wife and I but could be hard work for some.Wheelchair access would be possible but not for every path, quite a lot of steps and tree roots etc. to negotiate.We took lots of pictures and spectacular scenery.Enjoy this exceptional place!Chris and Helen\"\"Athabasca falls was an enjoyable experience. There is plenty of parking, washrooms, and information regarding the falls. The terrain is interesting and there are trails to get to and explore the different sections. The falls are located about 30 minutes or so south of Jasper, very easy to get to with good road signage. They are located just off the main highway. Overall, a fun, pleasant time.\"\"The falls are stunning, noisy fast flowing water in beautiful surroundings. The path around the falls is really good as you get different views all around. There is also a path and steps to the bottom of the falls where the water is still and a beatiful green colour, lots of places to take in the scenery and capture photos.Like other places it was quite busy with bus tours when we visited but not over crowded to be able to enjoy the falls and the views.\"The waterfall is about a 30 minute drive from the Jasper city centre. From the car park it is only a couple of minutes to walk to the waterfall. The trails are well laid out and a bridge takes you to the other side so you can take many photos from various angles. When you cross the bridge don't forget to take the trail to the right as well. This will take you down some stairs through the old Athabasca river and gives you a view of the out flow.A beautiful walk with amazing sights. A great place to stop and amble through the terrain taking one's time to enjoy great scenery and informative plaques.\"Easy to get to and enjoy the thunderous roar, take your time and walk all the way around. Colours are exceptional\"\"Wonderful opportunity to go see the falls in the off season! Had an opportunity to go up to Jasper and highly recommend doing it in Oct/Nov when you pretty much have the place to yourself. Views of the Athabasca Falls and the mountains behind it were spectacular. All the mountain peaks were covered from the recent snow, but the ground down below was bare. Only a handful of people were at the falls so it was the perfect opportunity for taking pictures and enjoying the views. Being the off season, there was next to nothing for traffic coming down from Jasper on #93, so you could take your time driving to the Athabasca Falls and back. Really great destination to make for a day trip out of Edmonton and back like I did. Water was amazingly blue and the steps down to the pools below were really cool. Remember to respect the site and to pick up any garbage you bring with you. Keep it beautiful for everyone else to enjoy. :)\"\"Hey!These Falls might not be the tallest you've ever seen,or the widest,or the most forceful,but when you tie them in with their location,their backdrop and their history,you must admit they are something special.A photographers dream,do not forget your camera,well worth the visit! Be wary,because they are something else,you,ll probably find yourself in a crowd.\"The waterfall is really beautiful and the place offers a really short hike so you can access the Athabasca river for nature photography. A really good idea to stop there on the way to Jasper. Very impressive to observe how the water makes its way through the rocks!This is a beautiful little walk. The wonders of nature is incredible. The way the water has cut thru the rock over the centuries.\"amazing waterfalls, however its very crowded during summer, on our way to Athabaska Falls, lots of fossils\"\"Gorgeous, majestic, powerful. A wonderful stop along the Icefields Parkway - very well laid out so you get stunning views.\"Only 2 min walk. You get there by the time you stretch your legs out of the car parking. Spectacular view of the falls as is all of the falls in the area. The plus is that there no hike involved.High volume falls where the Athabasca River enters into a narrow canyon. Within a few hundred feet of large parking area near Icefields Parkway. There are several viewing platforms with great views of the falls. This is the best waterfall in Jasper National Park.This place is amazing. The falls and the whole area is simply amazing. My sons uses a wheelchair and this place although they could have made it accessible on most places they did not so it was a bit hard to get around but the it was worth it. I recommend everyone to visit this place\"Having checked out my list of stops to make on our two day visit to the Icefields Parkway, Athabaska Falls is difinitely at the top of my list. It is a powerful waterfall set on a gorgeous rock shelf. There is a trail and bridge that takes you to the far side of the river and gave even more great views. Not a long stop, but well worth your time.\"\"Plenty of water rushing through during melt would but very good and noisy, very pretty around falls, nice gift shop\"\"This is a must see! We did all the trails from the one that goes down to the beach below, to the one that leads up to the rapids of the falls. Spent a good 2 hours enjoying the views. An easy hike. Even for us whom arent the hiking type. Dog and family friendly.\"Visited many waterfalls while I was in the Rockies and as like all the others Athabasca Falls did not disappoint us.Water flow was very high whilst on our visit which made the sound of the river and Falls even more spectacular make sure you visit when you are in the area. Plenty of parking and good walking trails are on offer for you.\"Athabasca Falls was just one of our tours that our Travel agent organised for us when we visited canada, it was really interesting and lovely scenery well worth a visit\"\"These falls are on the route from Banff to JasperThere are a few routes to take around these falls and you can explore down to the river level on the rocks. Plenty of free parking nearby making the area easily accessible.\"Beautiful falls. I would recommend going early as the trails get extremely busy. It is definitely worth a stop if you are out this direction.Travelled with Brewsters tours with driver Al.This is one of the best operators I've used. Informative but with plenty of time to explore this truly magnificent place it is one of the must see views.Unfortunately the falls are full of rude visitors of coaches. Although beautiful be prepared to be pushed and shoved to take a picture. My advice is to walk a bit further past the falls it's quieter and you can still get nice pics.Beautiful way to see how the whole area comes together from the glaciers to the falls to rivers. Pleasant walk along a safe walkway and great way to take amazing pictures\"Undeniably the falls are impressive. Because it is usually in the dark it is difficult to take photos of. Also it is on the main tourist coach route, so overrun by tourists.\"\"These were by far the most spectacular falls we stopped at whilst in the Rockies. You can't comprehend the amount of water flowing through & the noise is unbelievable. Really easy to wander round, so an easy walk for those less able. Would 100% recommend to anyone that they stop here! Make sure you walk all the way round to have a look from every angle though.\"We stopped here on our tour from Jasper to Banff. The falls are beautiful to lok at and the roar of the water is pretty loud. There were not many tourists about when we visited so we had plenty of time to look and take lots of photographs. There are quite a few vantage points located round about and information signs telling you about the falls.\"What an amazing place to visit . we arrived very early in the morning and it was already packed with people and blooming selfie sticks .The breathtaking beauty made the walk in the cold and crowds worth it though.It always amazes me why people run to get to the front to take a picture ,it is almost as if the water was due to be turned off at 9.30 am :-D\"\"Great parking; paths well prepared, and then the falls themselves are just superb, enhanced as everywhere by the emerald colour of the rock silt. Blown away.\"A must see when you are in the Rockies absolutely stunning. Even my 20 year old nephew was amazed at its beauty\"If you are in the area you have to stop here. While the photos are nice, being there is even more impressive.\"\"Even in the Fall, the falls are amazing- the roar of the water through the narrow channels, turning turquoise green as it flows down river. This is a spiritual place for me.. I love it. Careful when walking- it's slippery, or icy - depending on the season!\"Visit Athabasca Falls on our way from Banff to Jasper. The view is amazing. A must visit place for everyone who visit Jasper. The blue colour water is really nice.

Worth coming here!Among such beautiful places to visit Athabasca Falls ranks as just nice. When along the way it is a nice stop but don't worry if you missed it.Wonderful Canadian Rockies and rivers along the Ice Fields Parkway. We were making our way to Lake Louise from Jasper and our friends had planned all our stops. They said we had to see Athabasca Falls. They were right. Quite a spectacular sight. I would highly recommend stopping here and taking your time taking pictures and enjoying another great spot in Canada. O Canada. You have a lot of beautiful country!Nice views with beautiful pristine water. It was well worth the trip. We are glad that we had the chance to enjoy this place\"A really pretty area. The falls are beautiful but if you want a picture of the falls without all the people who can't read the 'dangerous - do not climb over this fence' signs, you may have to wait a while.\"Experience the power of water over time! The glacial water is so beautiful and the rock formations formed over time are beautiful. Definitely worth the stop!I have been there many of times but this time I brought my parents and daughter. It's such a beautiful spot of cysts green/blue water. It's a must stop on your way by and really only takes a good half an hour if you wanna be quick and just look at the main viewing points.\"A popular spot for sightseers but they tend to arrive by the coach load. The few spots available for photography were overwhelmed whilst we were there.Worth calling in if you are passing\"A must see! Allow lots of time here for a good stroll & many different viewing locations & photo ops.\"Beautiful falls easy to reach from the parking area , fascinating rock structures, amazing blue water\"Like all waterfalls it was awesome to watch the water cascade down the falls at a point in the year when most of the high up snow has melted can only make you want to visit again in the springtime when the water must go over the falls in torrents. Great to seeWell worth the stop and exploring this famous site. The power of the water needs to be seen ( and heard) to be believed. And this was not the falls at full flow. It's been a dry summer. What it must be like at other times of the year.A visit to the Athabasca Falls is a must see. The barriers make it safe to walk through and the rushing of the water and thunderous noise of the falls makes one feel very close to nature. Not to be missedOne of my favourite spots to visit Been there before and quite enjoyed it as last visit one you should visit\"Beautiful scenery witnessing powerful waterfalls. Great place for picture taking. Good parking area. Can be crowded so beware of times to visit - early morning or late afternoon is probably best, like most places around Jasper.\"\"The falls are stunning & really interesting, in the way they are spread around. Very different from other waterfalls we went to. The canyon that the water goes into & through, before emerging into the lake is worth the visit alone.\"Well worth the short trip from Jasper to see these falls. Enjoy a short hike around the area. It is only 30K (20 miles) from Jasper.\"As we approach the spot, the mountains and forest welcome us in quietude with swirling water flowing on the plain level. Gradually, as we descend, new dynamics gets revealed between water and rocks. The water cuts through the rocks and falls down in great speed with thunderous noise. With sun on the blue sky, rainbows appear on the spreading particles of bluish white water. The walls of rocks take amazing shapes and colours. There are View points at two levels on which visitors stand and enjoy the grandeur of Athabasca Falls.\"It was an easy stop & had handrails along the path which helps old folks like me and others on wet or icy days.\"this is one of many experiences not to be missed. stepping out on to an ice flow is weird but exciting. melting ice ,sun beating down. photographers heaven.\"\"Lots of parking, some decent pictures, water falling into a canyun through rocks, spoilt for choice in the Rockies, but definitely worth a visit\"\"Definitely worth the stop off - even though it was quite busy, the falls were stunning and the colour of the water was beautiful!\"Easy to locate- well sign posted.These falls are a must. They are loud and awe inspiring. Plenty of different views giving different pictures. The power of the water is amazing in some areas and in others it is flat and peaceful. You can spend a good 30mins just looking at the falls but there are trails to do too. Where the water is still it is a lovely blue/green colour.The walk up to the top of the falls is not flat but with a good pair of shoes and good health you will be fine- it is a proper path.These falls are a must. Very impressive. You can get very close to the top of the falls. You can also take a path to go down to the lower river level. The drive from Jasper along the icefields parkway to the falls is amazing and probably has the most amazing scenery anywhere in the rockies\"A must see, breathtaking. It's just a short drive from Jasper. The signs are very helpful and it's not that far from the road.\"\"This hike gives you a chance to view the falls from all angles, before walking down the canyon to see where it all empties out into the Athabasca River. Beautiful in any weather. Sturdy footwear is required. Our UK visitors loved this place.\"\"If you are looking to see some rushing falls, this is the place to come. The hike is a bit steep, but well worth it. We enjoyed walking the trail to see gully views as well as the falls. You are warned to stay on the path!\"\"just an hour's drive from Jasper, Athabasca Falls was a stunning treat. The new parking area at the waterfall made it very accessible and the walk paths were excellent, allowing views next-to and above the falls. The surging, spinning water has made amazing channels and formations. A not-to-missed sight!\"Had visited this area previously in the rain but this time it was clear weather and the 4 of us spent about 1 hr following the trails nearby\"The waterfall itself is not that spectacular, but the combination of the falls with the views and the colour of the water are pretty nice.\"\"short walk off the parking lot and there are numerous angles to view the natural waterfalls, rock formations and river. Well worth the time!\"\"Beautiful waterfalls, definitely worth stopping off on the Jasper to Banff route. Plenty of parking and easy to find.\"This is one place you don't want to miss when you are in the area! Beautiful falls and you won't forget this one!\"Beautiful beautiful beautifulI loved it so much and I think everyone should go and enjoy these falls\"\"The falls are only a couple of meters off the main road, so make sure to stop by. The falls themselves are quite impressive, even when rather low on water like now. There are no hiking trails around from what we could tell, so it was a rather short stop for us, 30 minutes tops\"The Athabasca Falls are between Jasper - Lake Louise on Icefield Parkway and is just a quick stop on the way.The falls are gorgeous and the landscape and scenery around is beautiful.We were lucky to get to see it during a full moon and the landscape was mesmerizing in the moonlight.Worth a stop and spending time here.\"Free parking, tourists and groomed paths. This stop is your typical waterfall stop but has been well-developed by the park and is very tourist friendly. The wide paths allow for safe and easy walking, railings for safety and occasional seating. User friendly for everyone with a beautiful scenic view of the falls.\"\"Turn onto Highway 93A and take in Athabasca Falls - they are gorgeous. Here, the river's milky blue waters funnel into a chasm and break into a creamy plume of white water with Mount Kerkeslin as a backdrop. Usually crowded, but with beauty in nature like this, who cares? Take time to enjoy the nature & go to & view Athabasca Falls.\"So many palaces to stop on the Parkway that hard to choose - would definitely include this one if you can. Spectacular!\"If you are driving south on the Icefields Parkway from Jasper, Athabasca Falls will likely be your first stop, as it is close to the town. It's a pretty but short waterfall. Informative signs tell you about the local ecology and geology. Very nice.\"\"visited these with friends. amazing scenery, with lots to see. Clear crystal waters - you get a sense of power\"\"Nice stop on the drive to Jasper NP. Gorgeous waterfall, easy access from parking lot, and several viewpoints. Go early or late to avoid large crowds. In addition to the waterfall, there is a nice area to explore below the main waterfall with a rock cairn beach. The water color was amazing! A must-do on any visit to Jasper!\"\"Athabasca Falls is located approximately 30 minutes south of the town of Jasper along the scenic Icefields Parkway. It is a place definitely worth stopping and exploring. There were a network of paved pathways leading to various areas overlooking the waterfalls and viewpoints of the deep and narrow canyon. Athabasca Falls was powerful and gorgeous waterfall with a stunning backdrop of forests, mountains and the river flowing through as huge volumes of water rushed down into the canyon. There were a few lookout points offering different views of the falls along the trails. I visited on a sunny afternoon and the area was quite crowded with some of the lookout areas being very small, so I had to wait my turn in order to get up front and take photos. The pathways were interesting to explore and one of them led through a narrow section between two walls of the canyon with stairs carved into the rocks. There were some great vantage points overlooking the river and the canyon to see where the water had eroded the rock to create caves and unique rock formations over many years. Athabasca Falls was a wonderful area to discover, admire the natural beauty and take plenty of photos. The parking lot was large and could accommodate quite a few vehicles. It would probably be best to visit in the morning during the summer season before the crowds of people show up. If you’re driving the Icefields Parkway, definitely stop here.\"\"On the way from Banff to Jasper, we stop over at this place for around 30 minutes~ the view is not supreme but worth to a relax short walk during long drive.\"\"I give this 4 stars only for the sheer beauty of this place. I'm sure you've all seen famous shots of the falls with a kayaker below (photo credit to Chris Burkard for that one!). The water is dazzling and the short walk down the falls to the river area is picturesque with all the little rock cairns and green forest amidst blue water. However, you are literally elbow to elbow with hundreds of tourists standing in line to get the same photo from one small spot so it felt crowded and overdone. This is NOT a hike-this is a short jaunt along mostly concrete walkways. Although there are some trails that seem to lead to nowhere along the river shore down below. There are some cool stairs carved out of the old river canyon that make a great picture if you get lucky enough that no one is coming up or down it. We had to wait for that moment for about 10 minutes. We were lucky to get some beautiful pictures but were glad to get out of that crowded place and continue on to some less trafficked hikes.\"This place only takes about 30 mins to get to from jasper and is so lovely. The waterfall is so powerful at the top and the stream so beautiful at the bottom. Easy and free to park and only a five min walk from the car parkIf driving the Icefield Parkway you must stop at the Athabaska Falls it should not be missed. The gorge and colour af the water is stunning.h\"A lovely spot to stop along the highway. There are several fairly short paths that take you to different views. There were a lot of other people there, but it wasn't excessively crowded.\"We were so taking by the breath taking views of the Falls itself. How much power the water has. Even a rainbow was sighted for a great photo opportunity. We ate our own picnic lunch therevandvit was quite busy with tourists but we did manage .\"Athabasca Falls is one of many sights to be taken in on the Icefield Parkway between Lake Louise and Jasper, Alberta, Canada. The blue green silted rivers, the glaciers, the wildlife and the gorgeous views are well worth your time. There are enough stops to keep your kids occupied and enough awe for everyone. A ride well taken.\"\"This is a beautiful spot to stop and stretch your legs. Beautiful area, and each step along the pathway provides a unique view.\"The whole area and not just the falls is beautiful. The water colour is mind blowing and add the curvy shape of the walls from the old water flow will blow your mind. Read the description panels and you will understand.\"These falls are definitely worth a stopover of 15-30 minutes. You can view them from several angles, and witness the force of the water in the small canyon below.\"\"Unlike some waterfalls we stopped at, this one offered a few things you could walk around and see how the water had shaped the rocks around it\"\"Athabasca Falls are a lovely attraction, but not very accessible for people with mobility ptoblems as there are stairs and no ramps.\"There is a large parking lot and the falls are not too far from the parking lot. The water flow of the falls is very powerful!Fascinating geology of the area creating these dramatic falls. Definitely worth the time to take the short hike to see the falls.\"Definitely a place to visit if you are staying in Jasper. Also within reasonable driving distance from Banff. Beautiful falls, easily accessed. Plenty of parking. If you have time there are a few short trails around the area or you can just follow the easy pathway around the falls.\"A very pretty falls on the way to jasper. Lots of trails and views with gorgeous mountains all around you.\"Breathtaking power of water versus rock, the falls re simply awesome, and are definitely worth a short drive from Jasper.\"The is a nice stop on the drive between Banff and Jasper. The falls were very nice and the parking was adequate. We didn't spend a lot of time here but did walk around the area to see all the different views and take pictures.\"A very nice place to visit to see the fall. The fall was not large by any means, but water flow was wild and visitors could wander along the river to several viewing spots to see the river, the fall, and the mountains around.\"\"This is one of the prime visits near town of Jasper. we went twice, it is so incredibly beautiful. a must see.\"\"This is easily located off the highway and easy to walk around.It's worth the extra 10 minutes to go down to the bottom of the river, it offers a beautiful view.\"These falls are easy to walk to and the views are well worth it. There are lots of points from which to take photographs. It is worth stopping here if you are driving from jasper to lake Louise.\"This was one of many stops on our trip through the Rockies and what a stop it was, we went early in the morning not hoping to see many people but there was already 3 bus loads there, fantastic falls and the sound s were terrific a must when in the area,\"\"Athabasca and Sunwapta fall are along the same road fairly close to each other and are must sees. The beautiful blue water cuts through solid rock making for a unique experience.These are much more developed than the little know Todd's falls.\"This is a stop well worth taking on the highway between jasper and the Columbia ice fields . Ample parking and well maintained paths lead you to an amazing waterfall and river walk.\"Pretty waterfall, pushy visitors. My fellow tourists made this place annoying instead of a place of beauty--packed with people and hard to see!\"This Falls is amazing and a must see if in the area. Walk all around for different views and photo opps. Glad we stopped to see this; just another amazing sight in the Pacific North West!This stop was worth seeing as we drove the ice fields parkway. We didn't spend too much time here but enough to see the falls and the walk down to the river.\"The Banff and Jasper area is filled with canyons like this with water carving deeper and deeper into the rock. I think Johnston and Maligne get more attention but to me, this one was the most beautiful, with the blueness of the water and the colorful canyon walls.\"Great example of power of water ln sculpting out the landscape well worth a visit on way down from Columbia icefield\"We almost drove right past but did a u-turn to see what all the fuss is about. So glad we did. This waterfall is absolutely stunning!!!! There is no long hike to get there, it is completely accessible and so worth the stop. You are free to walk along the trail to get different vantage points but the view from the main point is the best. Do not miss this on your way through.\"\"Breathtaking. Take a short walk around to see where the falls begin, where they fall into a well, and then speed through narrow canyon walls. Absolutely beautiful.\"\"Lovely Water falls to see and hear that roaring water noise , nice natural scenery with canyons. nothing much else to do but must visit\"\"Trail was easy and scenic and every step. Many, many vantage points for great photos. Able to see much in a short period of time.\"Beautiful area. Be sure to walk over the bridge and on the the other side. Even worth going down the stream to look up the canyon.\"Spectacular waterfalls that can be viewed from a variety of different platforms.It can be quite busy and we had ice /mud due to the snow the previous day but it's definitely worth a visit.Allow about 45 minutes to see it all.\"This is a wonderful sight that is close to parking that is wheel chair accessible. Don't drive through Jasper without stopping.This place was one of our highlights of our trip. We visited them twice on our trip. Beautiful pictures can be taken everwhere. Parking can be iffy as it gets buys even in September. The kids loved watching the water falls.\"The waterfalls was beautiful, but it was not as impressive as other falls in the area. You had to walk down to the falls to see the pool below the falls or you could view the falls from a bridge a short distance away. I spent a small amount of time viewing and then I was ready to move on to another site.\"\"always wanted to visit these falls, to see the view of the falls and the mountain behind them, feel the power of the falling water\"\"Thundering falls have carved out an intricate and beautiful canyon. Hike is a short, meandering walk on a paved trail which is great for children or the more physically challenged. Also, it's a great diversion after a long day on the river or more difficult trails.\"\"Athabasca Falls will always inspire you to wonder through all the canyons, walk around the lake and enjoy all the scenery surrounding the Falls. .\"We arrived on a beautiful sunny day and walk down the trail to see this roaring waterfall. Lots of nice views and picture taking opportunities. Not to be missed.\"Just plain wonderful to see and hear the falls. There is a stairway to lower falls which can be viewed at the bottom.

A good place to stop for a bit of fresh air and nature.\"Athabasca Falls are sensational with nice paved walkways to see the falls & canyons from a variety of spots.Went here on a rainy day but it was still fantastic to watch the power of the falls. It was a pity we weren't there in spring when the water levels are more fierce.\"Super easy access. Without much walk, you can see the magnificent falls from different angles including up close right by it. One hour is sufficient.\"\"Beautiful, the path is well maintained and worth going to see - you can get so close to the falls and the noise is so loud - the water is so blue\"\"We had a lot of snow the first I. September and our glacier trip was cancelled due to the length of delayed trips waiting to go, so we went up to the falls, we weren't disappointed they were beautiful. Only downside was the amount of Asians pushing people out of the way to take pictures.\"Not far outside Jasper and well worth a visit for a couple of hours or longer if you want to take one of the longer walks.We enjoyed this powerful Falls. There were plenty of places to view it and also enjoyed the canyon hike. Be sure to have comfortable hiking shoes on. We thoroughly enjoyed the beauty and power of the falls and took plenty of pictures and some video.\"Wonderful falls that are awesome to see. We allowed an hour for this stop, on the Icefields Parkway, and used every minute walking all around this fantastic spot. There are warnings about climbing over the barriers, and sad stories of people who have died when they ignored these warnings, so we were stunned to see a guy in his 20's struggling to clamber back over the barrier in a particularly dangerous spot. No photo could be worth this risk!!!!\"Very few tourists when we visited. Well maintained steps and paths and plenty of viewing platforms. Powerful falls and canyons worth seeing but not overwhelming if you have seen huka falls in n.z.It was getting near the end of the drive and we were getting a little tired I'm not sure if we wanted to stop. So glad we did as it far exceeded our expectations of the waterfalls. There are easy walks around it and is very picturesque. Tired or not is well worth stopping to see. If you're coming from the north make sure you do it.\"One of the most beautiful spots I've seen in this beautiful country of mine! Wear comfy proper walking shoes, and make sure you take a lot of photos, it's something you will never want to forget!\"You have to visit Athabasca Falls if you come to Jasper - it's why you come here! An amazing example of water and rock. Loved it!\"The day we visited, it had rained for a couple of days, so the falls were quite spectacular and full. The force was quite amazing.\"These falls are awesome and there is a good walking circuit to view these falls from many perspectives.\"Great area to see, good short walk to the area from the parking area. There is also a restaurant and bathrooms, did not use them but convient. Nice views and places to take pictures, remember your camera or cell phone and it is free.\"\"Like almost everything in Jasper/Banff, this natural wonder is breathtaking and amazing, but it extremely overcrowded. Everyone in my party loved the view of this beautiful falls and was frustrated by the excessive amount of tourists, especially those with poor etiquette of which there are many. Steel yourself and go see it.\"\"Only 32 min and less than half and hour south of Jasper, Athabasca Falls is a really impressive and photogenic sight. Although the drop of the falls at 23 metres is not particularly impressive, what hits you is the expanse of the river rushing through a small gap at the falls itself. The sound of the water is deafening. The falls is only a short walk from the car park which is just off the Icefields Parkway. There a number of viewing platforms where you can get interesting different views of the massive flow of water. You can also walk down to the bottom of the falls on a good path and view the numerous potholes that have been carved out of the rock by the flow of water.\"\"“Beautiful, but it can be deadly” The height of the falls isn’t that spectacular, but what draws you to this falls is its sure power. Loud thundering tumbling crushing cascades of water. Carving its way through hard quartzite and softer limestone, you can trace where the water changed courses leaving dry gorges and smooth potholes. This can be a dangerous place. Several people have fallen to their deaths. Do not stray from the paths.\"\"These falls are just beautiful and easily accessed. The naturally carved \"\"stairways\"\" which the rushing water created over millions of years are now very accessible via a lovely hiking trail and new bridges. There are nice rest room facilities and plentiful free parking as well. You cannot get the full experience and views from the highway or your car. But its also not a difficult walk or trek to see the falls and the eroded rock. We visit Athabaska Falls every time we come to Jasper.\"Visited Athabasca Falls during our visit to BC. Was stunning - not far to walk to see these spectacular falls. Would recommend\"We were on a tour of the Rockies , this was an amazing place to visit , views to take your breath away .\"Part of a coach your. They were beautiful to see and would recommend going to see them in either a group or independentlyAmazing to see how powerfull nature is. The falls are close to the road and there is a pad you can follow to see the waterfalls from differend sides. There are a lot of tourists because of that but still worth a visit!Well worth a half hour visit as has stunning waterfalls and water eroded pot holes great for taking pictures\"I love this place and I have to go there every time I go to Canada.Don't miss the trip down to the lakes - its breathtaking.\"It is hard to imagine the raw beauty of the falls and how powerful the flow of the water is in order to create the canyon. It has to be seen to appreciate beauty.what a beautiful area and nice walking path to see many different views of the falls. It is worth taking the time to see the entire area.\"To say that this waterfall is picturesque is an overstatement, but you will be awed by the amount of water from the river upstream gushing though the relatively narrow openings in the rocks. There is so much water that if you can too close to the nearest observation platform, you will be splashed by the fine mist whipped up by the falling water, not to mention the puddle of water collected on the floor usually mixed with mud. Nonetheless, the waterfall is interesting and is worth a visit, but other travellers consider this a must see attraction as well and the place is kind of crowded even when I visited in September.\"Nice falls. Probably my fave across banff and jasper. Very powerful! Beautiful colours. If you haven't got time for a hike you can just do a fifteen minute walk to see the falls.This is the way great waterfalls should look. Over the years water has carved a path through solid rock to a great depth.Worth it even if you only have ten minutes to spare but you could spend a lot longer. Pretty crowded though.\"Falls and rock formations were superb and seen from a path that goes up, down and all over so you get many vistas. Great for photos! If you are into it, you go down to the very bottom as well which is fun, but not really necessary for the spectacularness that the falls are...a MUST SEE.\"These falls are well worth the stop. The scenery is spectacular. Excellent spots for photographs. Must see if in the area.\"We stopped,a s does everyone, and whilst the car park was busy we managed to walk around without being in a pack and found that if we lingered the tour bus people rushed round and left pretty soon. A beautiful spot and although this isn't a Niagra experience it is very special and worth visiting.\"\"Definitely worth a visit. The falls are not huge, but the site is beautiful and the paved paths offer many perspectives from both sides of the river for viewing and photos.\"Absolutely amazing place to visit. Just beautiful. Some falls can be a little underwhelming. Not this one.\"The trail and the viewpoints are very good. The impressive amount of water can be seen from the may viewpoints. There are sufficient signs where the falls and there surroundings are explained, which makes it worthwile to walk the entire trail.\"\"Definitely worth a stop off to view these falls, 30 minutes should cover it all and has some information boards to read. Dont climb over the guard rails as people have fallen in and died from doing so\"Amazing ! Can't believe how the river has drastically changed course. Live the views as it travels thru canyonsWell worth the drive. 30 min from Jasper. Wonderful views of the falls and you can take steps down to the river. Very easy walk.\"Not far from highway between Banff and Jasper. Easy walk to viewing area. Bathrooms and lots of parking. Waterfall is very attractive, I think it was best we saw on our trip\"An impressive falls and well maintained paths to lead down to it. Good information boards as you walk round. Allow 30 mins for a visit. The earlier the better as far as parking is concerned as it gets very busy.\"There are several viewpoints around the park to view the main falls, and other areas. This is a very beautiful waterfall - well worth stopping for on your travels.\"\"The carpark is very near the highway and then equally convenient to the short walk to get to these falls. A couple of foot bridges give you some great views, and you can walk under the road and down to a second platform to see the falls through the ensuing canyonOne of the highlights of my stops along the icefields parkway, I highly recommend this one\"\"This waterfall and gorge is great, the power of the water is amazing!Lots of good view points of the falls, well worth a visit. Nice walking path with a number of different viewpoints.\"\"Worth a camera stop as an intro into the Rockies. Beautiful setting.Convenient parking.easy to observe.\"\"I've seen a *lot* of waterfalls in my lifetime. It never gets old, and Athabasca Falls doesn't let you down.There are different types of falls. This one is straight up wild. It has energy. If you want to hike in a ways to see a beautiful waterfall, this one is not for you. This is a tourist stop waterfall. The views are good. Parking is easy. Access is also easy. Wheelchair friendly. Restrooms are primitive, and not the best.\"Stunning view from lots of different places. Some spots were for the able body with stairs and over hanging rocks and some views for the less able.\"We went on a tour of these falls, and really enjoyed being able to get so close to them, and to be able to walk around the falls for maximum photo ops. After some rainfall, we had lots of water to view spilling over the falls.\"\"Picture Perfect and breath taking, one of the most amazing Rock formations, Fantastic place to get some great pictures\"Fantastic waterfalls which need to secured from Japanese tourists trying to take a paddle. They spend so much time taking selfies instead of actually looking at the scenery . I doubt they even turn round . Unfortunately it was pretty packed the day we were there so it was a bit of a scrum trying to enjoy all the falls .\"Some of the most beautiful viewsWater phenomenal colors easy to get to. Close to hotel. Can get crowded\"I stop here every time I drive the icefeild parkway and I never regret it. The falls are always breathtaking. I like walking down to the bottom to avoid the crowds...as it does get VERY touristy. Get here early (very early) to avoid crowds. It's a great place to visit any time of the year.\"Great to take a quick walk and get some photos. Probably gets very bust in summer, car park was nearly full in September. Good to visit en route somewhere\"\"The falls here are very strong, decent number of available parking spots on a Wednesday afternoon. Amazing rock formations made by the rushing water over the many years. This place should not be missed.\"Accessibility was easy to see these incredible falls. We took lots of pictures....loved the unusual holes made by the rushing water.love these beautiful falls but dont forget to take the fairly short hike down through the carved out rock down to the river it is spectacular !!The Athabasca Falls are a must see for us every time we are in Jasper. The constant changing water levels and colours are beautiful and unique every time we go. If the sun hits it right you can even see a rainbow from the bridge with the water spray!\"A quick drive out of Jasper to this scenic spot. You don't need a very long time here - less than an hour.Definitely walk to a few different vantage points for variety in your pics.\"\"I go here often as I live a few short hours away, very relaxing and lots of places to wonder. Free parking and most of the pathways are paved at the top.\"We saw many waterfalls during our two weeks in the Canadian Rockies but this was one of the most beautiful. Definitely make this a stop along the way!\"After walking on the Athabasca Glacier, this was an excellent stop on our way to Jasper. Absolutely beautiful! Short hike to the falls. I highly recommend making the stop.\"Very nice falls and well marked out paths that lead to various different picture sites. I would also go to the bottom and to he lake itself as can et a good picture there.\"These falls are beautiful, easily accessible, and so powerful! It gets pretty busy, especially when the tour buses are there so we went earlier in the morning. It was absolutely gorgeous!!\"\"Awesome falls, so dramatic because of the sheer volume of water crashing over. If you’re travelling the Icefield Parkway, don’t miss it.\"\"Enjoyed a short visit to these falls on our return journey back down Icefield Parkway. Easy parking and short walk to falls which are tremendous, thundering water with vapour rising. Was busy with a couple of coach parties but a short walk down a short trail to foot of falls was worth doing (very gentle steps despite warning sign!) as it was route of waterfall many yeas ago.\"In a big country with huge skylines it's easy to get a little blind to the extraordinary as it becomes mundane . This is a great stop that reminds you of the sheer power of nature .breathtaking scenery and shocking power.Roaring falls located right off the highway with various easily accessible viewpoints. The power and volume of the water was amazing. Various photo opportunitiesThe Falls are just a short walk from the parking lot. The backdrop is absolutely beautiful and the falls have an unbelievable amount of water rushing by. Be sure and take your camera.Great falls to visit - must see attraction in the Jasper National park. Take your time to enjoy the beauty of the falls. Sunset time adds a multitude of colors for your photos.\"Athabasca Falls is probably one of the best stops of Athabasca. It's a really power waterfall; probably the second most powerful falls I've seen after Niagara, of course. There's plenty to explore here and you can spend quite a bit of time here if you'd like.Upstream from here, we booked a river rapids tour, which was a lot of fun. It was just class 2 rapids, which weren't bad at all. A couple of us had been on class 3 rapids, so it was pretty gentle for us. Others hadn't been rafting before at all, and so that's why we went with this particular one. There are options to do class three rapids closer to Sunwapta. We got lucky and ended up having our own private boat with just the four of us and a guide. She did a good job explaining the surrounding areas, and of course guiding the raft itself.\"I would not say it is a must to do if you are short of time but is definitely worth it. Amazing amounts of water rushing through and carving out rocks. Not crowded but some of the pathway was slippery due to smooth rocks and water from mist. The attraction spreads over both sides of the road and you may miss it if you don't pay attention. Don't forget taking pictures while walking on the steps between layered rock formations. Also do get down to the water level where rushing water ends and wide river flows out it is a nice view from here as well.I may not take more than one hour but it is worth that time.This waterfall is quite special...not the biggest by a long way buy is one which is very interesting. The force of the water has carved some interesting shapes and canyons and indeed has caused the river course to change over time. There are some lovely photo opportunities here.The falls are a short walk from the Icefields Parkway and have interesting signs to guide the visitors.Parking lot is right there. Many interpretive signs and ample photo opportunities. Go through quickly or take your time and enjoy the beauty and power of these falls. Spring runoff would be an exciting time to visit. Came in early September so crowds were low.\"When you can't see the mountains because of the forest fire smoke, focus on the waterfalls. This is one of the two best ones. The shear force and quantity of water is amazing and the canyon that it is carved is absolutely stunning plus you can walk through the old canyons and down to the beach where you see the river become completely calm at the bottom of the falls.\"\"Beautiful day, the falls looked incredible, easy to get to and get around.......great place to have a picnic lunch\"Athabasca Falls is a pretty cool stop on your way to either Banff/Jasper along the parkway. It's a well manicured walkway which will take about 20-30 minutes and offer different views of the falls. Part of the walk includes stairways through the old path the falls used to take. It's certainly worth your time to take a quick break from driving and check it out.Nice quick stop to see some amazing falls. Good walkways and trails along the way all well maintained.\"Our trip to the Athabasca Falls was memorable. The beauty of nature was breathtaking. Got there about 4 PM and just so many people experiencing nature at its best.Great place for hiking taking pictures and just simply relaxing.A definite must.\"This is a great place to visit.it is amazing to think that all this scenery and sound was created by water.\"We spent a couple of hours here in the pouring rain. Even the rain couldn't dampen our enthusiasm, this was awesome.\"\"Amazing falls and views with a short hike. Very popular place, expect crowds. Lots of areas to explore. Paved walkways.\"I remember how much I loved this waterfall when I travelled thru the Rockies a couple of times 20 years ago in my grad school days. You know how sometimes things are not as wonderful as you remember? This waterfall is still amazing to me after all these years. Thundering water even in late summer and great vantage points that make you experience the power of the flowing water. Well worth the side trip if you love waterfalls as I do.Many viewing points for the falls. It was really beautiful! There is also a lower falls. Do not miss this as you would regret!\"If you are prepared for the hoards of others with whom you will be visiting and with waiting in line to take photos at the best photo spots, the actual falls are pretty interesting. Don't forget to hike under the highway to the lower overlook and to the river. There is a very popular photo spot from which many Instagram photos are taken, and it is hard to believe it is under a highway bridge until you've been there.\"\"The Athabasca Falls totally exceeded my expectations! The amount of water, the noise, the terrific photographic opportunity....well worth the time. We were there for about 20 minutes and frankly I could have spent an hour. If you are in the area between Jasper adn Lake Louise, please make time for this: truly wonderful.\"\"We took a Brewster Tour of Lakes and Waterfalls. Our first stop was the gorgeous Athabasca Falls. We had a little over an hour at this stop so we were able to hike up close to the falls and take some of the shorter paths to get different vistas of the area. the glacier fed falls gives the water a milky blue look. the water so so cold and yet we were there on a gorgeous July day with the sun and warm temperatures. Make sure you were good hiking shoes, you will want to walk around the area. Lots of free parking. Our tour bus was one of the first to stop in the morning so we were able to get great photos. A must see on a trip to Alberta.\"\"A humbling display of nature's ability to use the forces of water, gravity, Venturi & inertia to sculpt rock into beautiful forms over time, sensuous curves & outcropping of stone on which moss & tree still manage to cling & find a foothold. Inspires awe & wonder but also a healthy wholesome amount of fear for those wise enough to heed the park signs to stay away from the edges, respect the fence boundaries & recognize how puny we are in the face of such power.\"\"Lovely place to stop, walk down to the canyon as well as up to the top, they are only short walks and a 30 minute stop gives you time to see it all.\"\"Stopped here on our tour it was beautiful, but make sure you wear good walking shoes. There was a gentleman there selling chocolate waffles on the day, with other treats\"\"This was one of the must see spots in Jasper National Park we had to visit. This was amazing to see the falls, the canyon area and the beautiful surroundings.This takes about 30 - 45 minutes to truly enjoy. The falls and the accompanying river canyon was a true wonder. This is not too difficult of a walk but hiking shoes or a good pair of supportive shoes is recommended.There is ample free parking, and it does get busy once in awhile due to the tour buses arriving. Even with the amount of people there, we were able to get some nice photos.\"\"Just stunning - anyone who did any Physical Geography at school MUST go - really my geography teacher would have been hyperventilating! Was so excited the kids thought it was hilarious and my daughter even considered changing her GCSE options to include geography, and she does like geography. For someone from the UK who thinks High Force or Aira Force Beck is exciting this was mind blowing. You can get really close - we went early morning and on a sunny day - the light on the rock formations and turquoise water is awesome!\"\"Take a walk along this beautiful canyon and waterfall. It's a nice walk that I would not miss.Do it and you'll be rewarded.\"It was a very warm day when we visited the falls. But the spray from the falls wa refreshing and the sight breathtaking!\"Athabasca Falls were spectacular and worth the stay in Jasper.Mother nature created a wonderful sight.\"\"I was able to see the falls last month, then I went to the Alps of Switzerland in August. This compares well with anything I saw in the Alps. Switzerland has great views but this is just as wonderful\"\"Short easy hike, parking can be a challenge during high season. Be sure to walk the down river path under the road\"\"The attraction is a short walk from the car park and the views are spectacular and well worth a visit ,, We spent well over half an hour here , The falls were well attended and the walks are not strenuous at all.\"\"Well worth the stop off the highway to park up and have a little walk to see these falls. After parking, you can take one of the walks to go above the falls and then drop down to underneath the falls and see them in al their splendour.\"\"The falls are close to the parking place and enjoying the natural views is requiring no special effort and at quite a short time since it is a small natural point, unless you desire to explore more in sourroundings. I prefered the Sunwapta falls but since Athabasca falls are quite small, do not miss it as well.\"\"There are many falls in Alberta Canada and if this is something you enjoy, then you should not miss Athabasca Falls which are beautiful. We didn't get to spend as much time here as I would have liked as I'm sure there was a nice hike/walk we could have done but when there is limited time to do so many things, something has to give.\"\"Athabasca falls located of Route 93A are very beautiful. The glacial water from the Athabasca falls forms the Athabasca river which flows into the Jasper National park and ends up at the Athabasca falls where it fights with the strongest rocks in Jasper to the roaring Athabasca falls. Over time, the falls has changed as in some cases the water has won the fight with the rock and in others where the rock has stopped and channeled the flow of water. For tourists, these days we can walk in these areas. The fall itself is very beautiful and the overall tour is around 30 mins to 1.5 hours.\"Enjoyable walk and stunning views of the canyon and waterfall. We arrived early and would recommend due to parking issues\"Aside from being crazy busy with people, this is so beautiful, nice trail to walk on, paved for the main part. Then there is some dirt trail past the main part, which did have roots. There are dogs allowed, I guess, there were dogs there, which, the ones we saw were really good, but for people afraid of dogs just know they are there. Nice easy trail for anyone!\"\"Athabasca Falls is a waterfall in Jasper National Park on the upper Athabasca River, approximately 30 km south of the townsite of Jasper, Alberta, Canada\"\"Full, raging waterfall - beautiful. Nice paved trails to access the viewpoints of the falls. There are a few steps to some of the viewpoints which are not wheelchair accessible. This waterfall is easy accessible from the main highway. In my picture, you can see the main highway in the background.\"\"This waterfall, can get very busy during the day. We went around 8.30pm and it was still busy, but less so. The falls are amazing, and powerful. Well worth visiting.\"Wonderful visit to these falls and walk around the area - well worth stopping to take in this spectacular area .Right off the highway are the gorgeous turquoise water falls with path leading to several viewpoints as well as hiking trails.The title is an over used word but on this occasion the right one. The volume of water being shoe-horned into a narrow passage to cascade over the edge is enormous and so produces a boiling cauldron effect with a thunderous accompaniment. Well worth the short detour off H93.What a place!!!!! Don't miss if you're in the area beautiful you won't regret it the best falls we have seenit is a beautieful Waterfall between Banff and Jasper. we just stopped here to watch the fall. it is about 35km south of Jasper\"It is a delight to see the water cascading over the rocks.The accessability is very good though not suited for disabled people in wheelchairs.\"Falls that roar and spume spraying make this a must stop if you are in the area.Loads of parking also loads of people but lots if tours that move through quickly.Plenty of photo opportunities.These falls are easily accessed. There is good parking and the paths to the falls are okay. You don't need any real level of fitness to reach the falls and enjoy there beauty.\"Super easy to access, thunderous huge flow of water. Wonderful! The only negative is the huge volume of people as they drop busload after busload off --- try early or late. It was fun to view from multiple angles. Also, walk up the hilll by the bridge to get a good look at the lower falls and take the short walk down the canyon. One of my favorite falls.\"\"as always, wonderful to see. the best time is close to sun up, fewer tourists so you can take your time and soak it in\"Well worth the stop ... it will be a sought after and crowded spot for busses and the family photo shoots ... Look for that moment when you can take in the beauty and even get a great photo ... very powerful falls ... super viewing decks and platforms ... work your way around the side for better views ... the photos included will give you an idea of the beauty of the falls\"A wonderful place to stop and view! Easy access, great directional signage, and a natural sight that is almost breathtaking. Well worth the stop and a great photography experience. A must see!!\"\"Amazing falls, worth a visit. Good walks around. Avoid the crowds if you can help it. Nearby Edith Cavell pond is also worth a visit but you need a permit!\"\"The falls are always worth a stop. Best light is in the afternoon, which also means, more tourists. But the canyon and the stunning landscape are definitely worth it. If you are good on your feet, make sure you take the walk to the end of the canyon in the lower area of the falls on the other side of Hwy 93A (you can access this path from the general viewing area and take the path the leads underneath the bridge).\"Super place to visit. Dont miss it. Easy to access. We went with kid s and it was a great time we had thereDefinitely worth the time to visit and explore. Easy to find and there was plenty of parking space when we arrived!If you are traveling on the Trans Canada highway near Jasper you absolutely have to stop at Athabasca Falls. First the parking lot is right off the highway and the walk to the falls is very short. The trails are paved and smooth. Seeing these beautiful falls couldn't be easier and more breathtaking. There are several points from which to take photos. I suggest stopping at all of them. Nature doesn't get much better or more convenient than this.We popped in to see the falls here just on the off chance of seeing a road sign on our way to jasper. The views are great and it's only a short walk from the roadside to the falls. Lots of people will be there so you won't get lost. Nice little highlight when driving past.You must visit these beautiful falls and take the trail down the small canyon to appreciate how the falls have cut through.. Its hardly much walk for such a beautiful view.This place was amazingly beautiful and a great outdoor activity for young or old! Would definitely recommend this to anybody!\"This is a great falls. It is easy to access, offers wonderful views, and you get close enough to really appreciate the power of the falls. The railings are sturdy, and unless you (or you allow your kids) to climb over them, it is very safe. We went in fire season (Aug 17) but despite the smoke had a great time. It is a wonderful, easy to get to, and very impressive little falls.\"\"After the Columbia Icefields, stop at the Athabasca Falls. There is a short drive up to a car park which is quite small but has a fairly quick turnover. There are toilets here.A short walk down some steps and an incline brings the visitor to a viewing platform of the falls, which in late spring were still fairly fast flowing. If you have trouble getting down the slope you can still enjoy the falls from the upper viewing area. A pathway leads across a bridge where it is possible to see where the water goes to once it passes the falls. There is a small forest abutting the falls paths which provide some lovely photographs. A nice short break.\"\"A must stop off point on highway 93 the ice fields parkway. Fantastic view of land, Falls, canyon and lower lake\"Take about an hour to wander round and fully appreciate the falls. Get there before about 4pm when the sun has gone behind the trees and the photo opportunities dwindle a bit. But definitely worth having a wander round!\"Great falls, especially after rain the night before. Must stop here on the Icefields Parkway drive. Car park can be busy but it turns over fairly quickly so just need to be bit patient.\"Great to see but the crowds once a coach arrives is relentless on some of the look outs. Worth a quick stop when driving down the ice field parkway via highway 93A.\"Athabasca Falls is beautiful! It's about 17 miles south of Jasper and has many areas set up for viewing the falls, potholes, and canyon.\"\"Spectacular, magnificent etc, etc. Take the walk, get the photos. Wow. Its a must do photo stop with easy access for great photos.\"\"Stopped here on our way back to Jasper, it was very busy with tourists so I expect it would be better to visit early in the day. Impressive waterfall seeming to appear from nowhere...a few walks around the falls..and the Athabasca river is truly beautiful. Worth visiting this place if only for a hour or so.\"\"Powerful stream has carved a very deep chasm out of the rock bed, making for interesting viewing. Easy walk from the parking lot, good viewpoints created.\"It was busy being the 150 celebration of Canada but well worth it. The power of water amazes me and I love seeing these mountain canyons. Very short walk around and you can spend a little longer and walk down to the river flats after the falls.This is a crowded area of the park but worth the stop. The falls are beautiful and the area is really well maintained. This is not a strenuous hike. Anyone can manage it. We even saw strollers and wheelchairs on the paths.\"I had high expectations for this stop but, personally, I found that Maligne Canyon more impressive. There are crowds of people here and it's a little crazy. If you are expecting to get Instagram-type photos I would temper your expectations somewhat.\"Great spot to adventure the falls and the canyon! Amazing photo opportunities and super easy to get to!Did the Athabasca falls today and I loved it. Shows the sheer force of mother nature. The inukshuk's at the bottom that people made are pretty impressive as well. It is a must see for everyone passing by...even families with small children.A really great place to stop. Spectacular views of waterfalls and river. Worth stopping for the view.\"As everything around here in August, we're just way too many people 'trying' to enjoy the Jasper-Banff experience. Athabasca as all of the other super known spots are crowded....Athabasca falls are amazing but you have to be aware that you'll be sharing the amazingness with another 1000 people\"Beautiful landscape and falls. You can see how water crafted its way through mountains leaving impressive marks and potholes.Another really neat place to visit for some fantastic photos! The rock formations and the water falls are breathtaking.Take the time to stop and walk to the Athabasca Falls. Beautiful waterfall views and a great photo opportunity.\"One of many waterfalls we visited on our recent trip and to be honest they all will get 5 stars. The amount of water flowing was scary and they were just great. Lots of different views to take pictures, but none do it justice. We had no issues parking but do be aware there will be lots of people there!\"Really enjoyable and easy trail around the canyon and falls! A short drive from Jasper. worth a visit.\"Just go, you won't regret it. Basically right off the parking lot so almost no walk at all and definitely no hiking. Great for all ages and physical abilities.\"Very easy and short walk to the falls from the parking lot. Lovely picture opportunity with falls and mountain backdrop. Make sure you go till the other end of the falls - we saw lot of people just seeing it from the one end - the other end is definitely the best view of the falls.I like the hiking trail around the falls. You get several different views and great photos with the rockies as a back drop.\"The Athabasca Falls are pretty, but not the nicest in the Rockies. There is not too much parking and it was very busy during our trip.\"\"Beautiful Falls, great views. The river has formed a deep and nice canyon. Easy to park. Near Jasper. A have-to-see location.\"\"We were on a Tauck tour group going from Lake Louise to Jasper and stopped for a photo op at Athabasca Falls. Well worth seeing. I never get tired of seeing water falls. There were several lookout points all worth pictures.I would definitely recommend.\"\"This is a very popular place for visitors of all ages. The Waterfalls covers quite a large compound. When visiting here, do go around the other side of the Falls. Depending on the sunlight, you may catch the sight of rainbow at the other bank of the Falls.\"We arrived at Athabasca Falls (17 June) and the carpark was already filling up- busses too. The falls were fabulous and just a short walk to continue onto the canyon and the River. Most rivers were in flood during our visit so all the falls were spectacular.Worth a visit....stunning water falls.... amazing to see the force of water . There is parking . Just be bear aware !\"We stopped by on our drive from Banff to Jasper. Very close to Jasper , easily accessible. Before stopping here, we stopped at Sunwapta Waterfalls (Sunwapta means turbulent river). Well Athabasca falls is not only turbulent and torrential - its ferocious. This is a \"\"must do\"\" - the power of the water just blew me away. Its a \"\"wow\"\" !\"A must see stop along the way! Beautiful falls and easy to access of highway! Lots of paths to view the falls and area with easy navigation with small children.It is a mini Niagara Falls but surrounded by mountains. Easy to walk and view. There are several viewing platforms. Even the rocks with lichens were interesting.\"This is a must see if your in Jasper, it's amazing on how the water has shaped the rocks ??it's amazing the color and how fast the water moves, there is always a lot of people but it worth seeing!!\"\"We happened upon the road sign for Athabasca Falls and decided to see what it was all about! Wow! There had been some recent rain and the Falls was really roaring.Very picturesque and took lots of photos. Pretty crowded but well worth the stop.\"The falls are spectacular and landscape amazing. We were staying in Jasper and made it a day trip going to Mount Edith Cavell first and then on to Athabasca Falls. Definitely worth the visit. Plenty of parking and it's a nice drive on from Mount Edith Cavell instead of taking the highway.\"wonderful day to visit natures beauty. must see easy to get to, just minutes away from Jasper and it's free\"\"Just steps from the main road, don't miss the opportunity to walk to this hidden gem and experience an unexpected but delightful waterfall!\"\"This is a mini Niagara Falls. Fun to explore. Hidden but attracts crowds. Favorite for bus tours. 45 minutes to one hour is plenty to time to allow to see this, depending upon parking.\"really worth walking down to see the falls views over the hills and mountains are amazing. You can visit this on your way through to Jasper if you are drivingWell worth the stop. Beautiful falls with many lookout points. Very short walk to falls with good paved pathViews are stunning. It's a waterfall having different colors in different seasons. My visit was summer and the water is like silver white. It's a great visit and worth a drive into it. Highly recommend it if you're in Jasper AB. Location is easy to find too.The sheer power of the falls and river is breathtaking. The noise makes you sit and take stock of how powerfull mother nature is.\"Travelers have generally seen many waterfalls, but this one is worth the trip. There is far more water than in many mountain falls and the observation areas are excitingly close to the rushing water. There isn't anything else here, really, except some non-flush washrooms, but this is a memorable stop on a journey.\"Must see stop. Take the short walk at the lookout stop. Beautiful views. Get there early. Can be crowded in the summer\"Not a big fall. Great scenery. close to the road, and worth a stop to see it. Parking is convenient, not a long walk.\"We spent about a half hour here. Impressive views of the power of water eroding rock the Mist and thunder of the water made a great experience.One of the highlights of our trip. The power of the falls is amazing. Walk to the falls is flat but need to take stairs to see the river belowThis was our favorite falls along our drive up to Jasper and a beautiful walk along the slot canyons to view the files from different angles was enjoyable.\"Can get a little busy but a nice waterfall with some good viewpoints, pick the right time of day for the best light\"Getting to the falls was easy. What wasn't easy was trying to get onto the walkways for a picture. There were so many people. It was right in August when we went to the falls so that is to be expected. The photos you can take are worth the wait for others to move on. There is lots of parking but when we arrived there was only a few spots left. I suggest you go early in the day rather than later afternoon.Great walk with spectacular scenery. Lots of beautiful photo opportunities along the way. Easy walking.This is literally steps from a very ample car park so it is a popular stop for everyone including tour buses and it's very crowded. This also makes it difficult for photo opportunities as you will always have crowds in your shots but it shouldn't be missed. There are lots of little walks to explore the area and a lot of interesting information for geology buffs. The falls are amazing so you can't blame so many people wanting to view them.\"My lady and I share a hobby that takes us to many places, some mundane, some spectacular, and many in between. This resides in the spectacular.We arrived about mid-day and were lucky to find a non-parking lot parking spot. The weather was hot and sunny. Despite the crowds, we were able to see all of the advertised views albeit with some patience. We had been here a few years ago, but it was rainy and cold, and we didn't stay long. This time we stayed about half an hour and were able to take our time seeing everything we wanted to.I definitely recommend this attraction.\"A fine waterfall if you are interested in this sort of thing. Easy to access and you get up close and personal with the power of the water. Lots of toilets in the parking area.\"Athabasca Falls is beautiful, easy to access and worth your time if you are near Jasper. It's much closer to Jasper than the Athabasca Glacier. You will be glad you stopped to see this gem.\"\"Not the tallest falls I have ever seen, but very beautiful sorroundings. Nice pathways leading to the falls. Parking near by.\"This is a great place to stop and look around. Trails are easy to walk on and views are fantastic We took lots of pictures and saw both upper and lower views.Easily accessible from the car park. Worth stopping off to see. The paths are easy for people with limited mobility to get around. Lots of bus trips seem to stop there.\"This was very beautiful and it is hard to describe the rush of the water that has carved through the rock over the years. It was fairly crowded but we enjoyed it anyways. As many other sights, this is close to the road and not a long hike to get there. Part of the beauty of the nature at the Canadian rockies. Don't skip it.\"\"Anthabasca Falls are a short 50 ft walk from the parking lot, and very close to 93A and 93 (HWY 1) intersection. Our two girls - 12 and 16, really enjoyed the views. Anthabasca Falls are very impressive, the views are exhilarating, and you can truly admire nature's strength here. Be sure to bring your camera, and snap some pictures, as you walk leisurely for 15-20 minutes (there are many angles where you can capture the falls). Highly Recommended!\"\"When traveling through Jasper Park to Golden we stopped at the falls. It was quite busy that afternoon but we managed to find a parking spot in the large parking area. It was a short paved walk to the falls, wheelchair accessible, and I was able to set up the camera for a couple of good pics. There were clean washrooms on site and it only takes about 30 minutes to capture the essence of the falls. Worth a stop on your trip.\"\"On our way from Banff to Jasper (the most picturesque drive we have done so far), we stopped to hike the easy trail to see the falls - there were simply breathtaking! There was a gorgeous view pretty much every turn we made. It was also a dream-come-true for geography buffs - make sure you stop and read the plaques to learn the history of this amazing landscape.\"As with pretty much all sights in this area walk a little way and you escape the crowds and can be soon on your own. The falls were spectacular. The sheer volume of water and ferocity of them was really quite frightening. A good trip. On way back to Jasper we stopped at Horse Shoe lake which was probably nicer in my opinion. Emerald waters a bit of a clamber in places but deserted. It was stunningly lovelySuper easy visit and not a big time commitment. Great vista and video opportunity with the strength of the falls.We made sure that we arrived at the Falls early on the morning to avoid the crowdsThe Falls are very beautiful and we took many photos from the different places around themThe remarkable geology of the area is remarkable and the sound and spray from the Falls with the high mountains behind them and beautiful trees are hard to beat\"Great stop at the side of the road. Just moments to get to the falls and well worth the stop. Even if you have a husband that doesn't like to stop, make him because you'll all love it!\"Beautiful & majestic place to see off Icefield parkway. A 20 min drive from Jasper town. Parking could be limited but you could wait for an available spot as people tends to spend an average of 1/2 hour in this place.\"Many of the falls visited within the Banff and Jasper National Parks are viewed from the bottom of the falls rather than the top, unless you are happy to hike to the top. Athabasca falls are different in that the walk initially leads you to the top of the falls. It is the sheer volume of water crashing over the falls that makes them spectacular. Go and see them. You won't be disappointed.\"\"Impressive waterfalls, but was really crowded with tourists. One can walk to various levels of the water. Free of charge.\"\"We stopped to see the falls on a Cross Canada road trip and were very impressed. We appreciated the picture taking opportunity but more important, we appreciated learning about how the Athabasca river flows to the Arctic Ocean. This attraction is well worth the time to visit—The walk is easy and there are plenty of benches for resting if needed.\"\"The falls are a great photo opportunity any time of the year. The amount of water spilling over the falls varies a great deal. Spring, summer and fall pictures will look very different.\"\"The waterfalls are beautiful and it's only a very short walk from the parking lot so easy to visit. Nice trip if you still have some time left, you'll be in and out within an hour\"Worth a stop to check out these falling. Lots of people as you would expect but you can take different path to get some peace and quiet\"This waterfall was deceiving. It didn't look like much until you got up to the actual fall lookout. Once there, they were much more impressive.\"\"The falls and surrounding scenery are beautiful, but be prepared for the walk up the trail. Wear athletic shoes with good tread, and if you have walking poles you should bring them. It is crowded in August.\"Absolutely stunning place to stop off. Go down to the river too and get some amazing pics on the rocksOne of the coolest sights on the way from Banff to Jasper. Very beautiful! One of the best photo spots on our trip.\"Another outstanding feature of the Jasper/Banff glory. But it can get really crowded, parking isn't easy and the viewing area is small.\"\"It's like a miniature of Niagara falls. Plenty places to take pictures.It's not too far from Jasper.\"\"The falls, like the rest of Canada were fabulous. Not as big as I imagined but amazing nonetheless. Short enough walk to get to the falls so would definitely recommend as a stop off point!\"\"Easy to get to, and worth the stop. Views were amazing. I would suggest anyone travelling to make the stop.\"\"We were on a mission to see Wells Gray Provencal Park, Banff NP, Jasper and Glacier NP . While Glacier NP has a special place in memories Jasper NP is trully a diamond! Loved the Northern most part of the park and Athabasca Falls was amazing.\"Went here as partbof a bus tour. Just another waterfall. Worth a look but the crowds are ridiculous. You have to push through the crowds to get a photo. Would be ok if not too crowded.\"You don't go there expecting big waterfalls, but for seeing the natural beauties along Icefields Parkway and it is certainly worth visiting.\"Very scenic. Take the time to explore the whole area and get an idea of how this area has evolved over time. Great photo ops. WATCH YOUR CHILDRENThis was an easy to walk trail but absolutely stunning! Very unusual rock formations with the rushing water! Highly recommend!This is a must see for every family vacation! You can easily spend an hour here. Absolutely beautiful place.The falls were amazing and with the bridge that goes over it you can see it from many angles. Well worth the visit. About a 20-30 minute drive from downtown Japer. Get there early as it is popular and parking is limited. We arrived at 11:00 am an got one of the last few spaces although people are coming and going all day.\"The beauty of these falls is amazing, especially if you had the opportunity to go rafting on another portion of this river...\"\"If you want to be close up to a water fall this is the place,you can see it from every angle and when the sun is out the rain bows are fantastic.We have some great videos,warning you can get wet as well but that's the fun that comes with the trip.\"We traveled from Lake Louise to Jasper National Park on day 6 of our Tauck Tour of the Canadian Rockies and our guide Rob had us stop & visit the Magnificent Ahabasca Falls. They were absolutely spectacular with waterfalls & beauty abound! A must visit to this Magnificent site! Don't miss it!??\"Took the 93A and arrived at the back entrance and wandered around all the viewpoints that allowed you to view the torrent of water pouring through these small gaps in the rock! Nicely done walkways, bridge, viewing points, access canyons along old water courses to view from different angles! Enjoyed being so close to power of the river and nature!\"Great visit. Lovely views. Well wothe stop and the short walk to the falls. Very popular of course so there was a bit of jostling with the crowds. But this didn't detract from the visit. Highly recommend.\"They said it's the largest fall in Jasper/Banff area. It's right beside 93A, convenient. Just stop and take some picture, then leave. Definitely worthwhile to go.\"Enjoyed in the morning on our way from Jasper to Columbia Icefields. little chilly in the cloudy morning.\"A lovely walk that took a little under an hour (with a lot of stops to appreciate the views and take photos). The power and beauty of the Falls and the tranquility of the river beyond it were incredible. There were quite a few people there, but it did not feel crowded because there were so many viewpoints. I would recommend going down to the beach area beside the river, even though the steps are steep. There were some interesting information boards around the pathways and the option to walk further through the woods. Would not recommend the toilets - they are long drops, were filthy and really stank!\"What an unreal place - like being inside a picture postcard. Several places you can walk to and get great views of the falls!Great waterfall. This was our third visit and we have enjoyed it each time. The power of the river is impressive as it courses down the falls.A must when you are in the area. The sound and the beauty of these falls are carved in stones. Few from several vantage points to get the full effect of glacier melts.\"This location has easy access to a remarkable falls where one can walk across a bridge over the Falls and see down into the area below. The path on the other side of the bridge allows you to see the upper area rapids before the Falls and the lower area of the Falls, It also has a walking trail on both sides of the Falls. It is very safe to view and hearing the sound of the Falls is a treat as well. It is really worth the stop to see and I am sure you will get some great pictures for your album.\"\"These falls do not have a huge vertical drop, but you see the power of the water at work and the walls of the canyons are beautiful. The toppers are the signs. They are written with a verve you rarely see at parks and recount the dangers of the falls and the constant war between water and rock. One of the best stops on the Icefields Parkway.\"Athabasca Falls should be on your list of places to visit in the Icefields-Jasper area. Short walk from parking and you get close to the water. There are several hikes available around this area and it's common to see a rainbow around the water falls.\"Worth the visit. Definitely photo worthy.Not all of the site is disabled accessible (even the main parts).\"\"This is really cool. The fencing keeps you a little too far away but there are multiple viewing spots. Like most of the really neat things to see, parking is limited and its not setup to handle a lot of people. Didnt see any parks staff either. Still you shouldnt miss itI even got a cool shot with a rainbow\"Not quite Niagara but still worth a visit. Easy to walk around and you can go to a further viewing point if you want. Good restaurant and gift shop.You can just sit there and marvel at the amount of water from this big river getting funneled into this little neck. Sad reading about all the idiots who got too close and fell in and died. Beautiful spotEasy access we just parked side of road and walked to bridge. Beautiful spot to stop and appreciate mother nature.Not to far out of Jasper is the perfect spot to go for a short hike and amazing views. Recommend going first thing in the morning before it gets too busy with tour buses.\"The easiest and most convenient attraction to hit during a week in Alberta. Not far from parking and no hills, paved paths, and just lovely.\"This is a beautiful little hike to visit the Falls which are wonderful to experience. We shared the experience with our friends and took lots of pictures.This place is a must to visit if you are in the area. The falls and views are simply breathtaking and spectacular. Worth walking out to some of the more distant viewing platforms to see the falls - you won't be disappointed. I'll remember the views for a long time to come.\"Highly recommend going to Athabasca Falls when visiting either Banff or Jasper. It's free, plenty of parking and lots of great vistas to enjoy for solo, couples or families. Great for photos.\"A powerful waterfall that has great viewpoints near the parking lot. This isn't a hike but rather a pull off to check out. It's worth a visit if you have some time to kill.Surprised at how close you can get to this relatively small but nonetheless beautiful and powerful fall. The fall can be viwed from both sides and from above. Impressed by the way these various aspects are managed via fencing and signage. Apparently there are serious accidents and deaths when people have ignored these.\"We did a quick stop at the Athabasca falls on our way south. Although it can be busy it is worth the stop. The falls are spectacular.It is easy to get around and the place is well maintained.\"\"This is an easy stop along the way and worth 20-30 minutes. It won't be peaceful - there are lots and lots of people at this spot, but the falls are spectacular.\"Can be a bit crowed when the bus tours come in but worth the visit. There are washrooms in the park lot which can be handy. Take a jacket as the spray from the falls can make it a little cool even on a hot day.\"Great view of the falls, quite busy so best to go early in the day or late in the day, good place to stop, eat lunch and enjoy the view down by the water\"A bit of a honeypot but well worth the easy walk. The falls are just amazing. Safe due to good paths and fences.\"A great 10 minute stop to stretch your legs. It is a gorgeous place, but don't expect tranquility - Because it involves very little walking, tour buses are unloading here all day so the crowds take away some of the natural beauty of the place. In the summer time, don't expect to get a parking space between 12pm-5pm. Aim to go early in the morning or at sunset.\"\"These waterfalls were truly a memorable part of our journey to Jasper, with multiple streams and a beautiful picture-postcard view. Keep in mind it is a very busy attraction and thus very popular with tourists so be prepared to squish in among a crowd if attending during popular times! Note there are several vantage viewpoints to see the falls.For the absolute best pictures with your digital camera, figure out how to set a longer shutter speed. Between 0.25 to 0.5 second generally gives me the best results. Generally speaking, the slower the waterfalls, the longer shutter speed should be to give the nice soft effect of water movement. With very aggressive falls, shorten your shutter speed; in some cases where the flow is very aggressive, it will show up all white, so bear that in mind.Please kindly indicate if you found this review to be helpful as it will allow me to better focus my future efforts! Much appreciated - hope you have a great time and safe travels!\"Six adults and two young children hiked around the well marked trails to view the awesome falls. The trails are safe and designed for people with a variety of abilities. Lots of parking spots were available as well as bathrooms.This was a super crowded venue that was less impressive than expected. We would recommend continuing further into Jasper to Maligne Canyon! So amazing!Just a short walk from parking lot to this awesome sight! You need only a short stop but so worth it! Spectacular!Definitely worth a stop! Very crowded - best to visit early or late in the day. Many great views of the falls. Allow 30 min.\"Nothing ruins a great day in nature like 500 people fighting for the same parking spot. The falls themselves were incredibly powerful. There are paved paths to get you from the parking lot ( or road) to and around the falls. No hills to climb, lots of guard rails and warning signs - not that common sense is in short supply. Many huge rock formations and overhangs in the falls that make for great pictures. Expect to line up to get the shot you want. Too many people in a small place for me. But you should still stop here\"\"A short trail walk to the falls. Hard to imagine all that water going over the falls.Go early to get good photos by yourself\"\"This is a beautiful setting and a scenic place to stop. The falls are in more of a canyon, so overlooks are small and very overcrowded. Worth the stop, just be prepared during high season.\"\"This falls is beautiful and worth the short hike. It is very crowded, but that doesn't seem to detract from the beauty.\"\"Athabaska Falls is a wonderful nearby attraction from Jasper, Alberta. We are glad we stopped by and explore the trails which offered even better views of the falls. Definitely well worth the stop.\"\"These are a wonderful set of falls, with tremendous views. But it can get very crowded. Try to get there early (before 11:00), and before the numerous bus tours arrive. Well worth a visit.\"\"Apart from the sheer physical majesty of the place it is so well signed and explained by the information on site that one cannot help but be impressed. This is why I came to Canada. It is so much more than \"\"ahsum\"\".\"\"One must stop and view the falls...no matter how limited on time. It is not only beautiful, but also a wonderful example of the pure power of nature. If one is a photographer there are many locations to take that \"\"one shot\"\" of the trip. If you are a hiker, there are plenty of footpaths that allow one to meander among the woods and river/falls. The best locations for viewing are, understandably, crowded. However, people seems to recognize that everyone would like to have that special \"\"vantage\"\" point view and are courteous with their time at those locations. Small childres should not be left unattended or unsupervised, however. There are locations along the trails where one might get too close to the waters and could potentially slip and fall. That said, it is too beautiful and powerful to miss.\"\"Pretty incredible sight. Great trails to walk down and see all there is. Take lots of pictures, walk down to the ricer and put your feet in the cold water.\"\"Athabasca Falls are a great stop between Jasper and Banff. If you are not a hiker, but want to enjoy beautiful falls this is the perfect place to go. There are walkways all around the area, scenic views, and nice photo opportunities. It is busy in July and August, but still a quick and easy way to close to beautiful falls.\"Stopped of here as a part of our tour and they were a great sight part of Canada's wonderfully scenery.\"This is the second time that I have been to Athabasca Falls and I could hardly wait to show my Husband and friends what I had seen before. The Wow factor of these falls just takes your breath away, I would recommend that anyone that is in the area to stop by and see this beautiful Gem.\"The falls were gorgeous and an easy walk to get to in order to see. One of the best falls to see in Jasper National ParkWe made a quick stop in the afternoon at Athabasca Falls. The falls are close to the parking area. The falls have cut a very interesting rock formation.\"Athabasca Falls offers a beautiful view of the falls and an adjoining canyon. This is a busy spot so it is best to go early in the morning or later in the day. This is a great spot for photos, offering good views of the mountains as well.\"Excellent walkways and scenic spots to capture the beauty of the falls. Signage provides explanations about the falls.This is an easy to reach waterfall which has many different viewpoints for photos. It is huge and powerful - compared to any other falls we saw in Banff and Jasper National Parks. A must-see.\"Roaring churning intensely powerful falls. A good walkway through. Worth a stop.There are steps, may not be ideal for wheelchair users.\"\"The force of the water as it thunders down is really quite amazing.Follow the walkway to the various vantage points in order to appreciate how the water has carved into the rock.Information boards tell the story.\"\"Nice small walk with lots of info on the falls and paved paths. Just like other waterfalls it was just a lot of white water flowing over rock!! It is interesting though seeing the formations in the rock, imagining how hard the water hits the rocks. It's is a nice quick thing to do, not something you'd want to run into while kayaking!!\"This was a very cool waterfall and more unique than traditional falls. There is a well paved walkway with three look outs. Can be a bit crowded... but this is a must see. There are some non crowded trails that run behind the falls that may be worth a look.\"Athabasca Falls are always beautiful to visit. The scenery, the power of the water, the deep, abandoned channels, the cool spray on a hot day ... the only thing that detracts from all this are the hoards of people. Feels like Disneyland at Christmas time! Wouldn't be so bad if there weren't so many stupid, oblivious people who think they are the only ones on the planet! But I digress (because there are those people everywhere). Given that, I would still highly recommend visiting the Falls - a not-to-be-missed sight along the stunning Icefields Parkway.\"We visited Athabasca Falls in early July 2017 - beautiful falls with multiple viewpoints; You could do a half-a-day trip from Jasper or do a pit-stop on Icefields Parkway prior to arriving into Jasper (Assuming you are driving from Banff)\"Simply beyond words, a must see. Beautiful and stunning waterfalls. Let nature speak to you. Go as early as you before crowds arrive.\"When driving to Jasper along the Glacier Parkway you pass the falls so may as well stop and have a look. Good views and only a short walk from the car park. Longer walks if you want them. Good photo opportunities.Easy to get to from the parking lot but equally as interesting drive to get to the falls off of the main highway. We had not seen many animals prior to this particular day and we saw 4 bears driving along 93A!The amount of water is truly impressive. There are a variety of areas to walk around and get different views of the falls and surroundings. Take your time and explore a bit to see the other elements of the landscape.\"This is an old park that is not well maintained, but the falls are outstanding. It's amazing how water can carve through stone.\"\"An amazing display of God's majesty. Some steps to maneuver, but a very well constructed walk. A must see, if going to by driving by Jasper.\"\"You can see the falls from various view points . Recommend you hike to all of themChildren have a great time\"Pretty place easy to get too plenty of parking lots of tourest in June o well we are all tourists soke where\"We stopped on a whim, passing by on our way from the Columbia Icefield. it was totally worth it - the hardest part was to find parking! This can be a super short visit (we were only there 10 - 15 minutes), or you could bring a picnic and explore a bit more. Highly recommended!\"Awesome waterfall with easy access. There are some stairs but it is worth the time. You will need about 30-45 minutes if you want to stop at every view point on the trail. Not very busy when we arrived late afternoon!\"This was quite an amazing visit. You witness the power of the water and how it erodes the rock. Take the time to walk down to the bridges, it is well worth doing. Stunning views.\"This was a 'chance' stop on the highway - that I'm so glad I made. It was beautiful - and the information about the origins and the flow of the Falls was wonderful.\"Stunning falls. Would thoroughly recommend that you walk all the way down to the 5th bridge. Its not too tough. The signage is a bit confusing. But its quite simple. Follow \"\"7\"\" down to 5th bridge and then follow \"\"7f\"\" back to the car pArk. Enjoy!\"We travelled from Jasper to Banff and stopped to see the Athabasca Falls. It is a short drive from Jasper. The falls in summer are spectacular. Rushing water into a canyon. powerful falls. A well maintained site and good pathways. Well worth the visit\"What a fabulous place to visit / lovely walk., stunning sceneryA must visit for all ages and levels of fitness\"\"Get ready to take lots of pictures. The falls, river, and rock formations are great. Be prepared to spend about 30 minutes just looking and enjoying the scenery.\"\"A short walk to an amazing slice in the earth! Take time to walk to the bottom, your many steps will be rewarded.\"\"They are currently building a new bridge, so some access points are blocked, but this was very cool to see. Gets you out of the car and a beauty view for a few minutes, so it was work the stop!\"\"One of the must do's when visiting Jasper National Park - very nice falls, quite easily accessible after a small (not difficult) hike.\"\"Definitely worth the stop. It was nice to see the falls from several different locations and to go to the bottom and walk into the water. The parking is limited, but plenty of room along the road.\"What a wonder of creation is Athabasca Falls. We loved the raw power of the rushing water over the rock. It was very crowded as there was a tour bus there at the same time as us. We walked along the paths and when we got back to the falls they had gone so it was much more pleasant to see. Definitely worth seeing.Enjoy the vista of the water running and swirling as it passes thru crevices in rocks bouncing off walls.The stunning aquamarine water rushing and tumbling into the river gorge is a glorious sight. It's a short hike from a roadside parking spot and seems quite accessible for most visitors.Was a beautiful hike and didn't feel over crowed at all. We really enjoyed both the hike and the falls!Falls are so close to the road you really need to stop. Short path to the falls with nice vistas to see then. Take a rain jacket.Such a fantastic place the noise of the falls is very dramatic it has 6 bridges only got to 5 as it was very steep & such a hot day I just could not make it to no. 6Worth a visit particularly early summer following the glacial melt as amount of water coming down the falls is amazing.\"Great easy stop on the road between Banff and jasper. Seems to be less popular than some of the other stops (sunwapta falls, Peyto lake) so a good place to take in some gorgeous scenery without huge crowds. Very easy and short walk down to the falls which are spectacular. Beautiful forest surrounding the falls too.\"Good to visit. 30 minutes required at most. Try the 93A route from along route 93 to make a circular tour from Jasper. Quite a bit of wildlife on the quieter 93A road.\"Visiting Athabasca Falls is highly recommended. The views were awesome and I greatly enjoyed my stay at this location.Beautiful and stunning.Highly recommended.\"There was sufficient parking. The walk to the falls is easy and they are really fantastic. The force of the water is awesome.\"Great views from several platforms and viewing areas. Parking is a bit hectic as it seems like on the road is the only option, however there is an off-road area, so look for that.\"\"There are so many other places to go, waterfalls to see, hiking options ... Athabasca Falls seems designed for tourists who want to walk a couple of steps, take a photo and leave. We thought it was totally overrated and enjoyed many other places in the area a lot more.\"Beautiful setting. The waterfalls were well worth visiting. Easy walk to the main viewing area. Other longer walks along the river also easily accessible.\"We had the falls almost to ourselves for an hour, caught the sun bursting over the mountains, and were able to go all around the falls and go down to the river before the invasion of busses of tourists.\"Lovely place to stroll along the trails and see the falls from different view points. It can get crowed.Beautiful fall. At this time waters were high which made the fall of the waters stronger. There are a parking lot and washrooms. Be aware that this a touristic place snd it is always full of people visiting.Has to be experienced if you come to Jasper....can spend as little as 20 mins there or as long as you like. Not many facilities other than toilets....and there are a lot of steps on part of the route.\"You will not be disappointed, these water falls are breathtaking and very much a great photo opportunity\"\"We stopped at Athabasca Falls on our way back to Canmore from Jasper. Well worth the time! It's a very short drive off the parkway to a large parking lot w/ plenty of washrooms. You can hear the falls well before you can see them. We've visited Niagara falls a few times and of course they aren't as that tall but what makes Athabasca so special is how close you can get to them to feel the mist and of course, the beautiful mountains behind them. Depending on what time of day you're there, you can catch a rainbow in the mist. We love it there.\"A waterfall with many walks in the surrounding area and also river rafts below falls. Good facilities in car park. Falls are impressive and thunderous and you may catch a rainbow in the spray from the waters.Our friends took my wife and I to Athabasca Falls. I had never been before but was very impressed. The area is great for taking photos. I can't wait to come back again. Parking is easy. For taking pictures of the falls it is better after about 1:00 so the sun is not in you face.\"Despite being very busy this time of year,it is quite a sight.Impressive and majestic! The way water carved its way!\"\"Do not miss these falls. Incredible !!We are telling you.... do not miss it !!Take the entire family and witness Mother Naturedoing her work, effortlessly.\"Beautiful falls & easy walking though some uneven footpaths &steps you can walk back to where you started in about 20 minutes but make sure you see the lake to it's not just a place with a waterfall.This fall is really worth a visit. The view is spectacular and the formation of the rocks and water is breath taking. It is an easy walk through the first fall but I understand you can spend quite a while if you want to see them all. Take care with the smooth surface of rocks when you walk. It can be quite slippery.\"These impressive waterfalls are not too far from the car park (for a young child who was with us). Although reasonably short in height, the falls had terrific volumes on the day we visited, creating good spray and noise. The really good things is that the water continues down through a canyon cut out by the water over ages, and continues to impress as it heads downwards. Well worth a visit!\"\"These fall were great for a quick stop between Jasper and the Icefields. We whitewater rafted from the bottom of the falls the day before, so it was nice to see the view from the top!\"Only a short distance off the highway. Breathtaking falls through narrow cuts in rock with many scenic overlooks.\"Saw pics online and couldn't wait to see for myself. Sort of a 'canned' experience, with trails that are paved, giving the feeling of being at a theme park.\"\"The river has cut down 60 feet or so through the limestone. the signs warn you about the dangers of approaching the edge and the gorge is steep and the waters rush though, worth seeing.\"\"As you are starting toward the Columbia Ice Field from Jasper, don't miss these beautiful falls. Several different views and they are all gorgeous. For maximum effect take a video with the roar of the falls complimenting their wonder\"\"A short walk from the parking lot brought you right to the falls.Stopped here on way back rom Mt. Edith Cavel\"Beautiful falls just off the road but very crowded. Saw a rainbow! Easy paths to walk and see the falls from every angle. No services. Lovely\"Easy to do from the road, can be a quick stop. Definitely worth stopping for between Lake Lousie and Jasper\"\"A must see except during low water in autumn and winter. The waterfall, slot canyon and the mountain beyond is quite photogenic. Be ready for major crowds.\"\"The Falls were easily accessed from highway 93 or 93A.It was a spectacular sight. We first saw the upper part with roaring white currents. The resulting mist was cold and refreshing. We followed the trail to the lower section where there was no water. The pothole showed the power of water carving the rock. The river was a starting point for whitewater rafting. Along with snow mountains in the distance, spruce trees along the river, the view was breathtaking.\"\"We've seen Athabasca Falls countless times, as we show it to every visitor who visits us in Canada. Every time it's different, especially the beach by the river. This time the water was so high that there was hardly any beach visible. One time the beach was filled with inukshuks that people built out of the stones on the beach. It's always gorgeous.\"\"By the time we visited Athabasca Falls, it's the 5th day of our trip to Banff/Jasper. The excitement to see amazing color of the lake/falls was wearing thin, but this fall is still very much worth seeing. There is a little walkway and viewing platform for you to have better view (if you don't mind getting wet). I have been to a few places (Iceland for one) and this fall is def. one of the best.\"The power of water is unimaginable! But you can see it at work in Athabasca Falls. There is a fairly easy walk featuring various viewpoints and features of the falls. We were in awe of the massive amounts of water pouring over the falls and the features that the water had carved into the rocks.\"See how the water forms the environment, a short and impressive walk.... even though you will meet a lot of people during the vacation time....\"We came here having stopped en-route to Jasper and OH MY GOD! This place is just full of foreign tourists which makes it extremely difficult to navigate and get around. We did enjoy the sights and taking pictures and there is lots of parking.\"A great trail for stretching your legs, and taking in some beautiful sights. The trail is well maintained with several viewing areas. Can really get crowed with tourist, but well worth seeing.\"\"Not tall, but powerfull and beautiful waterfall. It is worth the stop for sure. Easily accessible for older folks.\"\"This was one of our last stops on our road trip that day from Lake Louise to Jasper, but well worth stopping for. Its a large and powerful waterfall which you can see from many angles and can get very close to. The old gorge with steep steps is also very impressive and the views at the bottom are stunning. Definitely a must see place\"one of several falls/canyons in the Canadian Rockies that must be near the top of most must-see lists. it was not too much walking and lots of nice views. the information boards were good and the path was in pretty decent shape.\"We drove the whole way from Banff to Hinton in a day, and we saw a LOT, but Athabasca falls really stands out as the top attraction. I've seen a lot of waterfalls, from Niagara to the Lower Falls of the Yellowstone and many others. This is truly one of my favorites.\"\"Beautiful falls, easy to find and an easy walk to see the falls. Several different walk options, from very short (200m) to longer walks if the mood strikes. Recommend stopping in to see.\"Quite a nice short experience. Lovely falls and good education on its history. Good location for picks and a stop to break the drive from Jasper to Banff. We loved the rainbows as well. You can walk to the bottom to see the river as well.Fantastic place to visit. This was a great place to go on a rainy day. I touted it to my spouse who had never been there before. Awesome.We went here for some exercise and the scenery. The views at all the bridges are very interesting. The power of water is nature.We stopped here with a tour group. The falls are so pretty and I loved the sound of the rushing water. I did a little video of it on my phone so I could always listen to it. This is a must stop if you go to Jasper.\"So much wonderful scenery and we were fortunate enough to see a rainbow over the water. Take the easy walk around the falls to appreciate its beauty.Cheers - Jules\"\"Gorgeous waterfall, awesome hike..i am running out of adjectives to use for attractions at banff and jasper NP!\"Beautiful waterfall with very strong water force. There are several areas for viewing and Lots of great pictures to take here. Very scenic.\"This is a great place to get out of the car to stretch your legs on your way into Jasper. The falls are quite impressive. To see what the force of water can do over the years is truly amazing. There are stairs to walk and some inclines. But if you are mobile, you will enjoy this stop. Allow between 15 and 30 mins. Depending on how much you want to see.\"\"Due to being Canada's 150 and all the National Parks are free, it is extremely busy. If you want some great photos without people shoulder barging you, I reccomend not going at the peak times. If you're heading to Banff or Jasper I would say that this is a must see along the way!\"Nice falls - lots of geological history. Can be somewhat crowded but not too much so. Raft trips can be seen below the falls in the riverStop and see for sure! Short walk from parking. One of the best waterfalls anywhere. Short drive from Jasper.Beautiful falls. They are a must visit! Go early in the morning to avoid crowds. Nice walks along the river and the road leads back to the ski hill.\"This can be said for just about any of the stunning places along the Icefields Parkway between Jasper and Banff on a holiday weekend in July, but it was just too crowded. Still it is an amazing place. I prefer to hike the extra miles to get away from the crowds, but it's still worth stopping in to see.\"\"It was a busy warm weekend, and the side trip to see the falls, is always worth it!. Not to hard of a walk and the view is always amazing! Parking was no issue, many bathrooms, short walk, and I suggest prior to 10:00 am before the crowd saturates the view points. Please stay on the trail, it is frustrating to see visitors not follow the rules, and please use the garbage cans, keep our parks system pristine for the next generation to enjoy!\"Highly recommend! Easy walk and so pretty! Getting there early is always good to enjoy it. It does get busy and you'll want to enjoy it.The falls are absolutely stunning. It was a bit crowded so I would advise going in the morning. So worth it!Gorgeous falls. Don't miss this! It is worth every minute you spend there. Awesome site to visit but be careful with children\"Maybe not the same scale as Johnston and Maligne Cantons, but easier accessibility and still beautiful!\"\"The falls are easily accessible, off the highway and near the parking lot. We were lucky enough to catch a rainbow during the time which made the falls even more spectacular. The site is a main tourists spot with many buses making the rounds. Go there early if you are looking for less crowds\"Easily manageable for most people. Not wheelchair accessible. Quite dramatic picture ops! Busy place in July.\"Unbelievably spectacular waterfall in beautiful setting. Well worth the time to see this, but be careful not to fall in and kill yourself.\"I was pleasantly surprised by what a nice falls this was. It was also made better by being able to completely go around it. The park service had done a great job of providing a viewing path allowed for so many angles of this beautiful falls.Great place to stop. Very small area when it's busy. Very good road and washroom facilities. A great shop to take a look very friendly staff.The falls actually twists and turn almost like canyon. For photo to capture the whole falls from top to bottom is difficult and a wide angle lens wider than 12 mm is needed.\"If you are on highway 93 between Jasper and Lake Louise you gotta make time for these falls. Easy parking of the road, no hiking if you want a easy activity and we went at 8.30pm and it was quite and lovely in low evening sun.\"A quick stop along the way. It was hard to appreciate the beauty given the high volume of people. If you park along 93a you can avoid most of the trail by walking immediately to the main bridge to view falls. You can escape just as easily to avoid walking in the crowds.Breathtaking.AmazingPower of the water is surrealThe entire icefields parkway ride has so many stop offs and viewing sites and natural wonders. Please do not plan your vacation short just to avoid a hotel stay. We enjoyed the ride from Banff and enjoyed the ride greater when we returned from Jasper. Thank you to our Canadian neighbors.Love these falls. Have stopped here twice. Always amazing. Plenty of parking. Even parking for our Airstream! Worth about a half hour or more\"Pictures do not do this place justice. The volume of water and the sound it makes is unbelievable. There is a boardwalk for you to follow where there are amazing picture opportunities.Well worth the visit.\"The falls are right off the highway and are beautiful. They are well worth stop. There is minimal walking to the falls.\"We spent a couple of hours here later in the evening, and there was no crowd at all. The falls are beautiful but so is the canyon. Definitely worth a stop.\"You must hike the 2.5 mile round trip to the bottom of the falls. So beautiful. You can see how powerful the falls can be.This was our last stop driving from Calgary to Jasper so it had been a long day already - but worth a stop since it is a quick walk from the parking lot. Photos really don't do it justice so just stop and appreciate the roaring sound of the water the mist in your face and the natural beauty of the blue water.\"So much water flows wildly through this section of the river it makes for an amazing site and waterfall. Walk the trails, stay a while and listen to the thunderous roar of the water, look out for the local wildlife and get lost in its beauty. If I lived in this area I'd come over and over again just to experience this natural ruggedness and beauty of this place.\"\"If you drive through there make a stop- Its a nice Fall but very crouwded- better Visit wells grey Park, all 4 Main falls areMore spectacular and less crowded\"Waterfall plus mountains equals absolutely beautiful. Falls are right off the parkway. Great place to get out and stretch your legs on the drive between Banff and Jasper.Definitely don't miss this stop. I've visited quite a few falls in BC and these ones rank as some of the best I've seen... mainly because the public is able to so close to these.This was one of the easier walks to the fast moving water and falls. all the pathways safe to walk on. Being there in June the water was flowing very swift and beautiful to see!Get up close and personal with these falls. There is a very short walk to the Falls area and then you can take another walk down into a canyon area to see where the falls continue down the river. There are stairs down this area and you don't want to miss it if you can handle stairs. The powerful river is amazing. To see how the water has cut through the rock over the years is a sight to behold. Don't miss!!!\"Do not miss this site -- an easy walk from the parking area immediately immerses you in the beauty, sights, and sounds of rushing water.\"\"Easy to get to, practically next to the parking lot, a bit busy with tourist buses. I've seen a lot of waterfalls, this one is nice, above average. Because it is quick and easy to see and you are in the area, definitely should stop by.\"\"Stopped here on our way to Jasper. Great stop. Beautiful falls, able to walk around and go down to the bottom of the falls to a rocky beach area where you can climb around near the water. Some people took off their shoes and were in the water. There is also a walking path to view the falls closer up as well as other other trails. Good stop to get out, walk around, and take in beautiful views. Definitely recommend!\"\"Absolutely beautiful, the tumbling water really pulls you in. But when you look at the bigger picture how the water has cut through the rocks over thousands of years it's mind blowing. I'd love to show pictures and a video but Trip app won't pick up on my photos. Sorry you should visit you won't be disappointed.\"\"These falls are not spectacular in height but in the simple process of forcing an enormous amount of water through a very tight opening, they are an awe inspiring demonstration of the power of nature.Access is easy, just off the Icefields Parkway and parking was busy on the day we visited but there was frequent turnover. The walk to the falls was easy. There are plenty of viewing spots so don't stress if the first few ones are clogged by selfie takers - the spots further on are better!The short walk down to the lake is worthwhile to see the geology that contributes to this spectacle.As a footnote, there are many signs to stay within the fenced areas, which seems obvious given the power of the falls, strong currents leading to them, freezing temperature of the water and slippery rocks. Nevertheless, there were also signs that someone dies every couple of years by disobeying these signs and memorial benches dedicated to them.\"\"On a coach tour, this is usually just a short stop on the way to or from Jasper. It would be worth much more, because it is a true wonder of nature. The water is cascading down on the rocks with great power and provide you with a magnificent view. There are several footbridges and well paved paths over and along the torerential, white water stream. It rushes through narrow and deep canyons, giving the visitors endless photo opportunities. The paths are good enough (at least at most parts)for wheelchair access, although if I recall it rightly, there are sections which can only be negotiated through steps. A great experience, not to be missed!\"\"Fantastic views, spent a couple of hours walking round the falls.Spectactular. It was a very hot day, but the water from the falls was cool and rereshing.\"\"We were driving past on our way to Jasper and saw lots of other cars turn off the road. We followed out of curiosity and really enjoyed an unanticipated, short wander round this interesting spot. The waterfalls are the star of course but the rock formations are interesting too. We'll worth a 30 minute stopover.\"\"Short stop off main road Jasper National park.Beautiful falls demonstrate the power water. Parking is limited.\"\"We visited the falls with friends, lovely views etc. But I found it very frustrating for I have a knee problem and had to give up for there was many steps and slopes to undertake.\"\"This is a must visit. It is only a couple of minutes off the main road, parking is free. The falls are reached by boardwalks and is suitable for all ages. Even in the heat of the day you are cool because of the water and overhanging trees.\"\"After seeing many falls in our visit to Banff and Jasper National Parks, I wasn't sure about seeing another. However a friend had recommended we go so we did. Thrilled we didn't skip this breathtaking falls. Definitely worth a visit. Good for families with kids of all ages.\"The Athabasca Fall is just off the highway and a wonderful site to see. It is very easy to walk around the Falls the site is jaw dropping amazing. One of our favorite site on our 10-day trip to Alberta.We had lots of little kids with us and the fall's path were short and stroller friend. Not as busy as Maligne canyon.Stop on a whim and was pleasantly surprised. Short walk to falls that were very picturesque. Offered to take pictures for visitors.\"I'm sure it's great early in the morning but it was packed when we went at 5:30pmI would recommend Mistaya canyon instead\"\"We have seen quite a few water falls on this trip but this was the best to date. Spill off from glaciers high in the mountains cascades down at a fantastic rate. Admittedly I doubt people would shower under these falls unless they have the all clear from a cardiologist. The water is freezing cold, admittedly what else could you expect.\"The falls were magnificent...the picture doesn't do it justice. I took a video and that is much better. The amount of raging water was incredible.We just pass by this Fall. The view is great. Too bad we didn't have much time to hiking around. Walking around area is easy.\"We stopped here as we drove up the Icefields Parkway. The view was good near the parking lot but by walking a little bit, we were able to see the full expanse of the drop.\"Drove out to Athabasca Falls without knowing too much about it...very easy walk to the falls and worth every step....many different view points before you actually get to the falls. You even have a chance to go down to a beach ...but quite a climb down. Other than this walk down the rest of the walk was fairly easy..Beautiful spot and well worth the trip.\"Located very close to the Icefields Parkway and very easy to get to, it's definitely worth stopping at the falls.\"\"If you are visiting has per national park make to visit a visitor's center. We found this whilst driving, not from the road signs.It is a work of nature and worth a visit. I would say that this is not a visit for a day more about an hour or so.A definite recommend on any trip to has per national park.\"\"We visited Athabasca Falls for Canada Day. The weather was nice. I went with family, and we didn't know what to expect -- we hadn't saw any pictures. We just found it on a map, and decided we wanted to visit.The rushing river, the falls and the cold spray/mist of the water is inspiring.I have a heart condition, and can't do much stairs, but I was able to get around for the most part. The only thing I was unable to do, was walking down to the canyon below, which meant tons of stairs coming back up.There are some negatives that have nothing to do with natures beauty however.Parking was ridiculous. It probably took 15 minutes to park -- cars lined up, everyone scouting for vehicles leaving so they'd snatch that parking space. Some people resorted to parking on the side of the road. Of course it was Canada Day, so it'd be busier than usual. But I didn't know what to expect. And considering you're in the middle of nowhere, you wouldn't expect city-like congestion.I didn't use the washroom, but 2 of my travel mates did. The acrid sharp stench of the bathrooms was unbearable. And my friend said on top of the dirty conditions, he noticed shoe-prints on the toilet seat. For alot of newcomers to Canada, all they knew in their home countries, was to \"\"squat\"\" to go to the bathroom. It's unfortunate that they haven't learned how to use our toilets. I guess this is part of \"\"multiculturalism\"\"? Because it was Canada Day, there were instances where I was the only English speaking person around. All I heard was Chinese, arab, hindi, pakistani, etc.The actual beauty of the falls is worth checking out. But as for amenities, it leaves something to be desired.\"A very short hike to see the power and wonder of water. The mosquitoes are a pain (load up on bug spray) and go to the lower Falls if you can manage stairs.\"We did this stop while driving to Jasper, and it's definitely a must do! The views of the waterfall are spectacular, and it's all within easy walking distance from the parking lot :)\"It's definitely one of the better ones in the Jasper National Park. Easily accessible from the parking with a minutes walk. The information signs are interesting and the viewing platforms are very safe for young children as long as an adult is holding hands. There are three different points to view the falls and all are equally beautiful.A brief stop on our Collette Canadian Rockies Tour. Easy walking trails with several viewing points of the falls.With limited mobility we throughly the short level walk and were in awe of natures power to change the landscape.\"This is a must see - any time of the year! It's so gorgeous, you are not going to believe that there is a highway near the viewing platforms. Bring your camera and walk the entire way because you will get different view points and all are beautiful. To me this signifies Alberta's rough and beautiful nature.\"\"The Falls are impressive and there are numerous paths to take advantage of the features.Good parking and toilets.Signage from Jasper made it easy to find.\"We though we had seen the best after hiking Sunwapta Falls. More crowded but better. The short hike to the river is an added bonus and gets you away from the crowds.Loved this attraction. This was my 2nd time to this place and it felt awesome. Multi layered falls with multiple viewpoints. A must visit if you are in the area.It's right off the ice field parkway. It's a short walk from parking lot. Maybe under 10 minutes and you are already at the lower fall. Great excursion when traveling between banff and jasper. We didn't take the hiking trail to go along river. But I have a feeling we already got the best view on the fall.Park and an easy walk to three levels to see the falls . Nice picture taking opportunity. Don't miss.\"One of several beautiful waterfalls in Banff National Park. A group of professional hikers were hanging ropes across the falls, possibly to shoot a video or commercial. Easy access from Hwy 93 & worth visiting.\"\"Worth stopping off to look at and hear the rush of water as it passes through the narrow gorge. Superb photo opportunities.Shouldn't be missed.\"\"Definitely worth a visit, amazing waterfall, plenty of parking, lots of mozies so wear repellent if you don't want to get bit\"\"The Falls are impressive and the paths, platforms and informational signs are all good. We took many photos and were pleased to find good parking and toilets. We made this a separate trip from Jasper rather than a stop by on our way to Banff and are glad we did as we could not have spent the time these falls deserve.\"Not the biggest waterfall you will see but it may well be one of the most picturesque. The water has created its own path downhill and in doing so has created an interesting waterfall. It is well worth the time spent contemplating the whole geological process happening before your eyes.We went in June at the end of the winter melt so there was plenty of water I do not know what this attraction looks like at other times.The walk is short and viewpoint good for photography although I doubt you ability to do justice to the power evident in the falls.\"Great photo opportunity, lovely falls that you can appreciate from a few different angles to appreciate the power of the water.\"This is a definite must visit. Simply loved it. We visited this fall on our way from Glacier Icefield to Jasper Town. There are a number of other falls along the way but this is definitely the best. We even caught a rainbow over the fall too. Simply beautiful and amazing. And it is only approx. 30 mins from Jasper town.We visited this waterfall as part of a day-long bus tour. It was our last stop and the most enjoyable of the day. So beautiful! So much power! It's an easy walk from the parking lot to the falls and definitely worth a stop.\"Spectacular scenery - well worth the visit.Nature is amazing!!Make sure you have plenty of 'film' or memory card space!\"\"A definite must do if travelling down to Lake Louise or Banff.Went in June so lots of water from the winter season coming down.\"\"The most awesome display of mother nature and her waterfalls that I've yet seenVery well laid out with good viewing points and not overcrowded when we were there\"\"Stopped in while travelling with my parents. The falls are absolutely amazing! Loved all the little trails, especially seeing where the the water used to run through!\"The numerous water falls make this River so interesting to photograph and just enjoy the power of the fast flowing water. The river actually flows North which is a novelty for me being from the lower 48. The cold temperature of the water makes a refreshing mist as it cascades through the narrow gorges. There are many viewing locations within a short walking distance from parking area.\"Athabasca Falls is in Jasper National Park on the upper Athabasca River, approximately 30 kms south of Jasper Canada, and west of the Icefields. The falls can be seen and photographed from various viewing platforms and walking trails around the falls. Access is from the nearby parking lot, which leads off Highway 93A just northeast of the falls. Highway 93A takes off from the nearby Icefields Parkway, and crosses the falls on the way north to the town of Jasper. White water rafting often starts below the falls to travel downstream on the Athabasca River to Jasper.It is a Class 5 waterfall, with a drop of 24m and a width of 18m. (Thanks for the help of Wikipedia to get my directions right!)You will need about 30 minutes to view this. Worth a stop.\"\"Second time visiting this fall in 6 years and not a bit disappointed, the fall and the calm-after-the-fall area are both stunningly beautiful, the stairs going down are good photo oppt. Good enjoyable hour spent there. Highly recommended. Parking may be an issue if you get there late in high season.\"We took a bit of a side trip from Jasper to see the Athabasca Falls - and we were rewarded with another beautiful display of the powers of nature. The waters roar over the falls and into the several crevasses that have formed over the years. There is an entire separate ecosystem around the falls where you can see all kinds of different kinds of fauna . You need to walk to the bottom of the main waterfall to really feel and see the power of the water. Then continue walking to the opposite side of the falls so you get to feel the spray . So pretty and breathtaking. Worth the short drive from Jaser.We had no idea what to expect but this stop on our tour was one of the best. There's a hardened path (not paved) but very easily navigated from parking to the falls that takes 3-5 minutes to walk. The falls are very impressive - such a great place to take photos. When we were there it was very congested with people but it was well worth our time and effort.\"Visited here during a day trip to Jasper and it's attractions. The falls whilst having some steps and slopes are within easy access of the car park. When we visited, early afternoon, there were some crowds but not sufficient to get in our way or detract from our visit. The views all round are beautiful and the falls exhibit quite clearly years of water erosion on the rocks, creating pot holes - just remember your camera to capture it or an audio video is well worth the effort to capture it all.\"\"We are in Jasper for a couple of nights on an organised Saga holiday from UK through to Calgary, Banff, Jasper, Rocky Mountaineer and cruise to Alaska.This is an included photo stop on an organised day trip. Everywhere we have been in Canada so far has given us the WOW factor, and this is no different. In spring, with the snow melt from the mountains, there is a huge volume of water coming through this narrow gorge. Combine that with the surrounding geological features and consider that the falls have been eroding the gorge for millions of years and you are a part of history of the place. It is then that you realise how insignificantly small we are in the bigger picture.\"\"One of my favourite spots in Jasper. I come here often. I had a lovely day taking in the scenery. Parking was busy but do able. What I hated though was the mess made by people coming on and off the tour busses. There were several busses there and people were littering I think the tour director should personally pick up the mess if your guests are too lazy to do so. This is a national park. Tip - go first thing before 9am or after 5pm after the rush. Go down the steps to the pothole and enjoy the rushing water, the beautiful colour of the falls and see if you can spot the rainbow. Take eerie pictures on the steps when nobody is around. Amazing.\"Another beautiful sight to see in western Canada. So impressive and yet another representation of the strength and beauty of nature. We loved it.\"It's worth stopping here for 20-30 mins just to see the surge of water and the mist created by this beautiful and powerful waterfall. The walkway is easy to follow, with informational signs along the way. Definitely take a little time out to experience these Falls.\"Excellent view of the falls with interpretation boards along the path. The path is an easy walk and parts of it are wheelchair accessible. Worth the stop and short hike (about 100 yards) from the parking lot.\"We stopped here, while heading south from Jasper. Parking was easy, with a couple of lots. The falls are magnificent. The roaring water, and the mountains in the back ground make them really outstanding. The pathways are paved, and easy to get around. We lucked out, and got to meet a guy (Colin from Grande Prairie?) doing slack-lining across the falls. He had a rope tied to each side of the falls. He walked across and back, barefoot! Whoa! It was unbelievable. What a character, and what nerves of steel!It's a beautiful place to stop, and get lots of photos.\"\"Amazing waterfalls and very easy to access. Very popular stop so parking can be a challenge, but well worth the trip.\"\"We were glad we stopped to see the falls. It was the last stop before Jasper and we were tempted to pass it by. Easy walk, and doable for those w mobility issues. Very picturesque. 20 minutes or so does it justice.\"\"I hail from Arizona so when I see a waterfall, I go crazy with the water volumes, feeling incredibly energized and quite frankly, envious. The water here is crazy big this season from the snow melt and the glacier melt from upstream cutting through the granite. The wooded and rocky setting added to ambiance. The walkways are easy to navigate as the fresh and moist air is enjoyed. No bugs in June!\"Stunning to watch--amazing! Beautiful areas to walk and take pictures--take the canyon walk and try to imagine the water flowing with such force!Easy stop off of the icefields Parkway . Trails at top and to bottom of falls. Many perfect picture spots. Some if it is handicapped accessible. Port o potties in parking lot . Plan on 20-30 minutes.\"This place is magical, the force of the waters have carved out a beautiful setting to see. Walkways are railed off for safety but children should be attended to.\"\"Of the many falls along the Icefield Parkway this one is very easily accessible after just a short walk, and is an amazing spectacle for it's pure beauty and power.\"\"Great hiking trails, the falls you can follow all the way during your walk... just beautiful... nature at it's best\"\"We loved this hike! We started at the first bridge and worked our way down. My husband was smart enough to realize that my in laws and 6 year old daughter may not want to trek back uphill and ran back to the car, parked at the 5th bridge parking lot and met us in the middle. It is a long walk back uphill if you start from the 1st bridge. If you have small kids you may want to do what my husband did or hike from 6th or 5th bridge lot up and have a nice downhill return. Gorgeous!\"We were on a tour of a near by area and decided to call in for a look. Beautiful scenery and a smooth water course that changes as it enters a narrow channel that become the falls. Lots of photo opertunities to get pictures of the water hurling through the rocks and dropping in spactular fashion through th gorge until it completes its charge into a lower lake. There is a bridge crossing the gorge that leads to hiking trails or a loop back to the car park.What a great visit to see the waters fall and thunder by. Great views and lovely pics taken. A WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE ALL ROUND. a MUST SEE.\"This actually was my first trip to Athabasca Falls, I thought it was amazing coz of the proximity to the water from where I stood. I could feel the energy that was roaring by me. Never underestamite the power of water!!\"\"Worth a visit if you are passing through, the area is quiet and falls worth a view. There are also picnic areas and toilet facilities on site\"Beautiful waterfalls with hiking trails. A short stop-over to Jasper from our packaged excursion to the Columbia Icefield and saw strong rapid water gushing from the falls and at times forming a beautiful rainbow over it. Beautiful serene surrounding the falls.Well worth a slight detour to have a look. Well laid out trails allow viewing of the falls. The water was rushing through when we were there in the Spring.Gorgeous views how the waters and time has routed out the caverns and pools for the water. Wonderful experience.\"Loved going to this beautiful attraction. I would recommend good walking or hiking boots, a camera, bug spray and a sense of adventure! It's not a very difficult hike, but it does require some stability on the up/down.\"\"This stop is educational and impressive. This stop has outhouse facilities, picnic tables and clean water. Parking is ample and the venue is handicap accessible. Allocate a minimum of 30 minutes for this stop.\"\"beautiful falls & several areas to look above or below the falls. don't stay at the upper view point, be sure to walk down the trail for wonderful views as well. can feel crowded along walkways if several tour buses are there\"t doesn't matter how often you come here the magistic scenery is breath taking. It is a chance to just enjoy what nature is capable ofVery few words can describe this place. Mainly stunning and wow! It's only a short stroll from the car park and well worth a quick stop off to see the falls. Take plenty of pictures from all angles. You will get plenty of good ones!Nice stop on the Icefield Parkway but more crowded than the opening of a new IKEA. Probably best to avoid middle of the day.One of the best sites in Jasper. The power of the falls was amazing. They did a good job with the interpretive displays. Easy trail to walk around and see from different perspectives.Lovely walk by the falls Interesting scenery and well worth the walk - a bit challenging for those with mobility issues.The falls are not very tall but nonetheless very pretty. You will love the place. Ideal picnic spot. We saw it as part of our tour with Brewster.We took a motorcycle tour to the Falls. They are breathtaking. We could have looked at them all day. Highly recommend!You view falls from thw top end of it here. We cisited when it was raining heavy and water was wild. It has some good walkways made around it and picture spots too but there are many othwr great falls apart from it. Nothing special about it.\"The Athabasca Falls is approximately 33 kilometers south of Jasper and offers very scenic views and good viewing vantage points. Good parking, pathways and a great place to have a picnic lunch.\"\"We left Jasper early one morning and went straight to the Falls. By the time we arrived, it was snowing rather heavily (early June 2017) and we were almost alone there. There are many waterfalls in the Banff-Jasper area, but these are well worth a visit. Like everything else, however, I would definitely go early to beat the tour bus crowds.\"We loved the falls. The power of the water was impressive. Easy to walk around and great picture vantage points.\"My title says it all. It is NOT the largest, most powerful or grandest of all falls, but it is impressive in it's own right. I find it simply amazing what plain old water can do to something as strong and hard as stone. Persistence!!\"Definitely a large reward for the little effort to get to these falls. Something amazing to see without a long hike. They are so beautiful and there are a lot of different points on the trail to see them. Also the walk through the carved rock is kind of like a tunnel and a neat experience.The falls a an amazing place to visit anytime of the year. Frozen in winter and very energizing during spring and summer time. Fantastic spot to visit while spending time in Jasper.Well worth spending an hour here to take in all the different views of these Falls. There are many Falls in the park but you can really walk around this one to take it all in. Very powerful!What stunning views from here. Even braved the glass viewing platform and was so glad I did. Perfect place for photos.Well worth the visit. Got quite a few stunning photos here. Could have spent much more time at this location.Very easy walk too see this waterfall once you park.......worth the trip to view if you like waterfalls!What an amazing place...the beauty is undescribable. We stopped here on a whim...it wasnt on our list of places to visit. So happy we did...so please add to your list for a spectaclar site!!The recent rains fueled the falls. They were really going when we visited. Rangers shared info about a 12 point elk horn and a big horned sheep horn. They let us hold the horns to feel the weight. We got selfies with the rangers too. The falls are a very easy short walk from the parking area.Love Athabasca falls. Took my kids for the first time. Just the scenery is breathtaking. Kids were amazed\"One great vista after another. Water colors unrivaled with chasms, garges, and falls galore. Well worth a visit.\"We stopped here on our way to the hotel in Jasper - stunning. Absolutely stunning. Worth the wander around it for some excellent photos.\"This is a must see, you cannot go up the Parkway and not stop here for a look, well worth the stop, plus it's only a short walk to the falls\"\"After a disappointing ice field visit, we were impressed with the falls. We were able to take in the beauty of the falls, river, and rock formations that make this attraction a need to see. Even with a number of tourasses around, we got good views of the areas open to the public and see the wonders of nature. Stop in and see this if you are ever in the area. It is a must see.\"We were lucky enough to have a totally blue sky and sun for our visit here. We literally had rainbows over the falls. Stunning!We liked this because of its easy accessibility. No long hikes to the waterfall itself. We visited in Spring so waters were at a high level and the sound and fury of the waters as they fell into the gorge was a sight (and sound) to behold. Interesting rock formation around the gorge too.\"On the Icefields Parkway in Jasper National Park, Alberta, CA. Rated one of the most scenic highways in the world, and justly deserved, these falls are a don't miss topping to magnificent scenery. Essentially the Grand Tetons of Canada in my opinion\"Great fall at the Icefields Park Way. Short easy trail to the fall. What a power water has. Nice viewspots.A short drive from Jasper to view wonderful scenery. A great location for photography. There are also toilets at this spot.Great place to get out and walk all around the falls. They have done a great job making it very easy to look at from all angles.The amount of water this year was incredible! The water was high and moving so fast. The spray was like a light shower. Beautiful and awesome to feel the power of this waterfall. One of the most impressive falls in the area.We stopped by these falls when most of the rivers in this area were at flood stage. The amount of water flowing over the falls was astounding. They were as beautiful as Niagara Falls.\"This was part of Rockies tour and it was awesome, would recommend it to all ages to see, a slight walk not to demanding but worth it, views are awesome.\"\"Very well organised and very short walk from car parkThe old canyon is also very interestingDefinitely to be visited\"\"Such a beautiful spot, a must stop on your trip if you can accommodate. The falls are spectacular and there are lots of great vantage points and photo opportunities.\"Stopped here on our way to Jasper. Lovely area with good views of the waterfall. Nice place for picnic.\"Just stunning!! We are in awe of the amount of water around Canada and the amazing waterfalls as a result. Great views, lookouts and hiking trail.\"Spring thaw came late this hear so the falls were more like a glacier the\\an a waterfall . Very beautiful and an adventure to negotiate the frozen and flooded paths .One of our 'must sees' on our trip and not disappointed. We intended to go to the Ink Pots but the views and photo opportunities to the upper falls meant we ran out of time. The trail has been made to allow easy access with minimal disruption to the natural beauty of the canyon.Easy pull off of Icefields Parkway. Beautiful falls with great viewing areas. Lots of parking. Would be a lovely place for a picnic.Wonderful truly enjoy this . Impressive. Not very crowded when we went. Beautiful pictures taken. Be careful walking around not very safe but worth the effort.\"The best of best places is in here. I mean JASPER. Another place one can never skip to visit . As far as I know I am going for round 2,3....\"Great photo shots from many areas. Reminded me of Watkins Glen in NY. Great to see snow around the falls in multiple areas.\"Although it was a small fall, it was simply superb! There were a few angles to view the fall, so it was just refreshing to see it at those angles. Took a lot of pictures..Look out for the rainbow!\"You can get very close to the falls from a number of vantage points. Easy to walk to. Be sure to also see the abandoned waterway along the walking trail to the falls.\"The fall is located right by the Icefield Parkway, an easy stop between Jasper and Banff. It offers a short stroll to see snow-capped mountain and a nice fall.\"\"It didn't seem like much when we started but the falls are just beautiful. It twists and turns through narrow rock chasms, huge holes carved by the waters. The paths and bridges through the area give wonderfully different view for some great photos.\"I visited as part of a touring holiday and was blown away by these falls. They were truly a sight to be seen at this time of year as they were in full flow.A great waterfall to visit near Jasper. Quite easy to reach and very god facilities at the attraction. It is a 15 minute walk from the car parking to the waterfall area. It is well paved and easy to get to. There are a lot of areas where you can get great views of the falls for great photo Op. On the whole we had a very memorable time here and highly recommend it.\"This was our last chance to stretch our legs and engage our eyes on the Brewster Icefields Parkway Banff to Jasper Tour. We stopped 30 miles short of Jasper and ambled from the car park set away from waterfall (with facilities available after all that rushing water). We had time to take some close shots of the Falls and its glorious mountain backdrop and stroll over the different bridges for different views. As always it would have been good to have walked a little further and spent more time taking in the beauty, but that's not the point of a tour like this. . Our Brewster's driver, Jarrod, who'd been excellent all the way had the unfortunate job of finishing the tour by telling us of a cancelled Maligne Lake tour the next day due to a forest fire in the wrong place. His care of us on the day would make me recommend this tour to others.\"\"An easy stop right off the highway a short distance south of Jasper. Paved walkways and stairs take you around, above, across and below the falls and canyon. Very much worth the time to visit. We took the back road (not maintained in winter) on the trip into Jasper and found this less traveled route very scenic and interesting. The road is paved but is bumpy and narrow in places.\"Impressive waterfall located just off the Icefields Parkway. Definitely worth a photo stop especially in springtime when snowmelt provides lots of flow.\"The Athabasca Falls is worth the visit if you are in the area. Plan to stay around 30 minutes if you plan to see everything, including the old canyon.\"So close to roaring water. You will get some fabulous pictures! Only takes 15 minutes and well worth the time.\"Make sure you visit these Falls, they were amazing. So much water rushing through the rocks and falling down\"\"A good pretty falls, you do get a bit punch drunk on the amount of the falls and they do all start to fade together but these were good. A nice walk too on a good day . Worth the visit\"A lot of these places are good if you are touring by car. Good explanatory boards to aid your visit. just allow 30 mins unless you want to do the hiking round itThis may not be the biggest waterfall in the world but it is a worthwhile stop to stretch your legs and see both the force of the waterfall and the peaceful river.We almost missed going here and are so glad we did go. It is a very pretty falls and hardly anyone was there.We enjoyed our visit to the falls. It takes about an hour if you go slowly. It is safe and beautiful.\"The Athabasca river really thunders through this narrow gorge. Lots of paths and bridges to allow you to see and photograph safely, but still understand the power of the river.Its a good 30 minute stop on the road between Jasper and Lake Louise, or you can follow the trails and spend lots of time. Once you leave the main track there are few people around. The main parts get tourist coaches by the dozen.\"\"It's on occasions like this that TripAdvisor's rating policy confuses me. If, as many reviewers have rated it, this is a 5 star attraction, then how many stars would Niagara Falls receive from the same reviewers? This is pleasant enough and worthy of a trip whilst visiting Jasper or driving down the 93, but it's no Niagara so we've given it a rating of 3 which we think is fair. We arrived fairly early in the day and it was very pleasant, although it was spoilt when a coach load of tourists arrived and rather rudely noisily jostled for prime positions. I can imagine it's not overly pleasant during high season. The parking lot was probably 10% full when we arrived and I'm guessing it won't be much fun when it's full. Recommended, but be careful when you go and only expect a 5 start attraction if you've never seen a waterfall before!\"\"We were on a three week vacation from the UK travelling around western Canada. We dropped in about 9.30 am as it was very easy on our way from Jasper to Lake Louise. We were surprised to see so many coaches there already so early, but it did not stop us from seeing the Falls briefly. There was no need to hang about though. If you can, get there before 9.00 am.\"\"These falls are beautiful and stunning, with lots of informative signs to tell you all about what you are looking at and seeing.\"The Athabasca River thunders through a narrow water-carved sluice here and a network of paved paths and bridges allow visitors to safely approach and observe up close the power of the river. It was a special treat to spot some delicate ground orchids blooming near the path here in late May.Happened to visit Athabasca on our way out from Jasper to Banff. Stopped there and it was the most amazing place I saw. Highly recommended!\"Picturesque spot, wide falls with lots of water flowing over, saw a rainbow in the falls. Spend a little or a lot of time.\"A nice waterfall to see. It wasn't too crowded. You can get a good view from the bridge. Not far out of the way.Love the main attraction but lots of other interesting views as well. In may the little calypso orchids are out so delicate along the forest pathway.\"See the initial falls, then see the results off the falls down to the lake. It is really impressive to follow the water. We saw the falls in a dry period and after a rainy perio, really impressive!\"We visited this on a cloudy day. Even though it was cloudy it was still beautiful. The only thing was there were people jumping the fence to get very close to the waterfall and they were getting in the way of our pictures.\"Well worth a stop on the way to or from the glacier, allow plenty of time to explore the trails and take photographs from the many viewpoints.\"\"Great hike, easy trail - not too long, not too short . Excellent place to stop when going to Jasper.\"\"Been there three times. They are beautiful falls and canyon... This time, went there in the winter... slippery... The falls were hard to see as they were covered by ice... an interesting perspective and contrast to seeing them in the summer\"\"Hardly anyone there. The rush of the falls. Ravens feeding chicks in nests built into the rockface. Need telescope camera to get into their rock face nooks... Moss pillows on tops of canyon, narrow gorges and the sound of rushing waters...different colours of rock formations...too beautiful; a cold day so couldn't stay out too long, will try for autumn next year.\"Beautiful views and landscape. Popular stop for tourists. Not stroller friendly. My father inlaw said this was his favourite stop on our rocky mountain trip.\"Your hike here can be as short or as long as you want it to be. From the parking area, you can get to all the major angles of the falls within a few minutes. But you also have the option of walking up the river, so it's really the perfect hike. I suggest getting there early - tourists tend to linger excessively long in all of those spots you'd like to take photos.\"\"The nice thing about this hike is that it is a short distance from the parking lot, so all ages can easily enjoy this place. There are plenty of informative signs around to educate you on the progression of the falls, potholes, the canyon, etc. You'll notice a temperature drop from the observation deck down to the canyon - and the mist from the falls feels nice on a warm day. Many great viewing angles available.\"If you are looking for an easy hike this is well worth your time. The sights are spectacular. A little off the beaten path we weren't fighting any crowds though we went off season.This is a must see for everyone to see the awesome power of water and time!..been over 25 years since we were last here and it's still amazing.We stopped at a lot of places along the Icefields Parkway from Banff to Jasper. This was our favorite. Beautiful area.\"Close to Jasper and great drive to locationTrails are great and must take go pro gear for capturing all scenic spotsYou can choose a short hike to open area to chill out and enjoy mountain peaks\"A must see. Gorgeous scenery and easy walking trails. Senior citizens will be able to navigate the trails with ease. Highly recommend adding this stop to your itenary.low water season but still worth the look. Easy walk to the falls from parking area. Short drive from townIt is a beautiful spot however it is full of tourists. Hard to take a picture without having other people in it. it is still worth a visit.\"Situated about 30kms from Jasper Athabasca Falls are very nice,heaps of parking for RV's and buses,easy walk down to the falls with various stops for good photo opportunities,toilets are there as well.\"Great scenery and really good little hike. Trails were a bit sloppy in place but that is to be expected that time of yearThe most stunning views and lots of boards posting geological explanations about the Falls. Easily accessible walk to the Falls which can be viewed from several lookout points. Good signage about safety and warnings to keep on the paths plenty benches to relax all around. Very level and easy walk. 30km south of Jasper a short distance off 93AThe walking/viewing area was very well done and offered enough options for everyone from short walks to more extensive areas.\"On a tip from a Parks Canada rep who suggested Athabasca Falls over Sunwapta Falls as we only wanted to do one, we stopped on our way to Jasper from the Columbia Icefields.We started with our stroller but took it back to the car in favour of a baby carrier so that we could do the further reaches of the trail. It's listed as a moderate trail, but I'd say that the main part is easy, but the old canyon section is moderate. The views were simply breathtaking. The water crashing was just awe-inspiring, and we loved that they included the old canyon on the trail so that you could see where the water used to go. If you have good shoes and can manage some steep steps and uneven ground, follows the signs to the river, where the water ends up. It's quieter than the Falls and a perfectly picturesque vista for photos.Fantastic stop, close to the highway and Jasper, and you don't need to walk far to be rewarded with fantastic views of the Falls and surroundings. Also has toilets and picnic benches, which is a bonus!\"Have been to these falls many times over the years. It's always a nice visit. The falls are beautiful and it's easy to get around with little ones.Athabasca falls are absolutely stunning place to see. we make sure we go every time. It changes every year because the water hitting the rocks. So many different views and walks to take.\"Good walking for whole family trip. Big,noisy and cold waterfall with gorgeous texture of mountings sure is best place to take a family pictures.\"So pretty and easy to see and take lots of photos. The color of the water is ice blue from the melting glacial waters.\"These falls were so beautiful. Right off of highway 93, it is a close walk from the parking lot and a great spot to stretch your legs while on a road trip. Easy paths to walk on, great for kids as well as pushing a wheelchair or stroller.\"\"The falls are just off the hiway and easily accessible so you can take as much or as little time as you like to explore, parking is good, washrooms available. Tourists - STAY ON THE TRAIL don't wreck the area.\"Very spectacular view. The rest area is well laid out and they have public restrooms as well. easy paths to walk. Very short distance from the vehicle to viewing areaWe visited these falls as part of our tour with Brewster's tours. The falls are beautiful and worth a visit.\"It's nice but not that amazing .Located near the road.Why I have to wright a lot.It's not that big fall in do not know why they call fall any way.\"Beautiful spot to visit - easy to get to if you're self driving. Lots of good spots for photos. While there are the trails along the falls - good walking shoes are a nice idea.Just go! It was an incredible walkabout falls that are fed by a glacier. It is a short walk and you will see the falls and walk through an old channel. Bring your camera for great shots. I just don't know where else in the world you can see nature like this.The falls are beautiful and a must stop and see if you are in the area. There are walking paths to many view points and public washrooms on site\"This is my favourite place to visit in Jasper (25km south on Hwy 93). Worth it to take the time to visit not only at the top, but at the bottom along the river. Never ceases to impress.\"\"Thunderous and thrilling cannot begin to describe the Athabasca Falls experience! Water is a beautiful hue, and it's journey through the rock formations is wondrous to behold.\"We passed by here after our Colombian Glacier Ice field trip and I may say we kept coming back here.It is a well kept falls with reasonable amount of parking .If you want a relaxing gateway this is the place .Beautiful scenery and lots of points of history in the area .\"Stopped here for 20 mins or so and it was only a short walk from the car park. Great attraction as the there were two falls actually, the one to the left is wider and more timid and the one to the right is narrower but pretty ferocious - reminds me of the power of Niagara Falls.\"\"A can't miss stop on the road to or from Jasper. Take video along with pics to get the sound of roaring waters.Easy hike\"Just off the highway and only a very short walk from the car park. The falls are definately worth the visit.Must visit place and ultimate to visit.It was owe some place and one must visit any season of the year.\"I stop in to visit these falls every time I am in the area. They are beautiful, but unfortunately crowded in the summer season. Snap your pictures quickly and prepare to step aside so everyone can enjoy a moment and opportunity to capture a memory. There are tons of little trails everywhere so if you have kids or pets, make sure they are attached to you in some way. The crowding can really overpower anybody under four feet tall. There are picnic areas which are nice and some are in the shade for hot days. I personally enjoyed my time the most when I visited once in March, not many people and parts of the falls were still frozen and gorgeous.\"This is a must stop while in the Jasper Park. There is plenty of parking and easy paved trails to view the waterfalls and river. The rock formation around this waterfall is so beautiful. The day we went it was raining and snowing so trails were pretty wet. We just stayed in the main area. There is lots of signs telling you about this area. Very interesting that this river and falls flows to the Artic Ocean.\"After having done the Maligne area (lakes & canyon) we had one final visit on the agenda: Athabasca Falls. (Our) GPS did not help out in finding it so we had to do it the \"\"oldfashioned\"\" way with a map, but that had too little detail. Resulting in us - coming from Jasper - starting at the wrong end of the 93A, coming around the long route to the falls.Some really bad sections of road we came across; better lift your foot off the gas there and try to avoid the worst patches (traffic allowing of course). Better of course to travel down the 93 South a bit further and take the second exit to the 93A.The Falls themselves at this time of year are spectacular with ice and snow still present. Makes for some great pictures, really. One can get pretty close to the Falls at various spots and angles. Absolutely worth the trip!\"\"It had been a long time since I visited the falls but we had family over from Ontario and we had time for 2 attractions - Athabasca falls had to make the list.The falls were kind of low because it was early in the season and the mountains still had a lot of melting to do. However, the path to the back area where you can check out the canyon was flooded so it was pretty difficult to get back there.Even with the lower water on the falls, it is still a majestic sight and sound (I love the roar). One of the water runs was frozen which was an added bonus.\"A great place to click lovely pictures ..Worth a visit on road trip from jasper to Banff ...We visited them in morningAfter visiting the Columbia ice field we returned to Jasper by way if the Athabaska falls. The walk round the falls is well laid out. There are notices to give you information and you are advised to set aside half an hour to do the walk. A path from one side of the lower area to the other side is currently under water so you need to walk along a couple of tree trunks! This may not appeal to everyone. At this time of year there is overhanging snow so it makes a very pretty sight.\"I highly recommend taking the time to stop here, it is definitely worth it. It's beautiful and easy to get around.\"The falls and the gorge that they have created are marvels of nature. Sort of puts in your place if you think that mankind can have a major long-term impact on the environment. Walk up and around and down the gorge for a full tour.\"Athabasca Falls are so lovely and the walk around the area is nice. The path to follow is an easy walk and the views of the river down below are awesome. The Athabasca River is a really nice color and makes for nice pictures. I will say, people need to be careful and mind the railings and barriers. People always want to climb over them to get better pictures, but people have fallen and died here, so respect the Park rules!\"\"Take your camera you will get plenty of great shots. Keep your eyes open for chipmunks, and other small animals. The falls are amazing and well worth the stop\"Visited only for a few minutes when driving to Jasper. Worth the stop to see the fall. Very pretty and there are a few levels you can stand at to see the fall.\"Excellent stop! Loved the Athabasca falls hike. we visited in August with our two teenage sons. Great hike, but gets busy so get their early.\"I've been to Athabasca Falls in all seasons and it's beautiful no matter what time of year it is! Lots of chances for great photos!\"We visit this falls during our way from Jasper to Banff. This falls are near the highway, but really nice to visit. It's no problem to visit it with young childs.\"Excellent stop. Unbelievable view of falls. With a mountains in the backround. Highly recommended. AND ITS FREEEEEE!!!!We took our 2 toddlers to the falls and had nice time. The walk is short and fairly easy. There was still some ice and snow on some parts of the path but we could see a lot. Part of the falls was frozen still. The lower walk way was so full of water that we couldn't access it like we could during summer. It's a must see and easy to visit with the whole family.\"amazing views, scenery, my favouirite place in Jasper. very peaceful and relaxing.I go there every time we are in Jasper.\"\"Very beautiful falls, there is picnic spots, and it is a short walk. Worth the detour from the road.\"\"Its all described in the other reviews, but if you're able-bodied enough, and have the time (and if you don't have the time them make time), and the underfoot conditions allow (i.e. its not iced over), then clamber your way down to the actual lake for a view that is simply spectacular. Dare to go for a paddle !\"\"Forget about it, don't go to Jasper or be on the Icefield Parkway and not stop here. Short walk from the parking lot for amazing view, longer trail down to the bottom if you're interested.\"Lovely stop off between Banff and Jasper. Good parking with outhouses. Great views over the falls with a large mountain in the background. Lovely colours in the water and we were lucky enough to see snow and ice down the falls.I wish we had more time to walk around all the trails but we had to settle for the main viewing area. It was truly beautiful and we will for sure go again and spend more time there.Great location as it was just a couple of minutes walk from the parking lot. Very close to highway. Turquoise waters.\"A spectacular view awaits you along many other recommendable stops along the Icefields Parkway. The gush of water squeezing past the gorge is mesmerising, you could stare at it forever!\"\"Located between Jasper and the Columbia Ice Fields …. The falls itself wasn’t particularly mind blowing, but historically it possessed enough strength to carve out a small gorge immediately downstream of it. Make sure you walk down the canyon to observe the force of the water and the beautiful different blues hues of the water\"\"We visited in April so it was still partially frozen but makes for a lovely stop on your way to/from Jasper.Accessible trail during warm seasons.\"\"In summer and winter it's just beautiful and a nice little hike down to the bottom, in summer you get a must which is really refreshing and the winter you can really see the amazing icicles and colours of the water\"\"30 minutes to walk arround , very bussy in summer, waterfalls are special! Parking area could be full.\"The waterfall itself is still iced over for the most part but it doesn't take away from the beauty of it all. A nice area for a picnic and take in the beauty and fresh air. Will be coming back this summerVery beautiful falls with milky blue water from the glacier flower. Easy hiking trails and great photo opportunities.\"The parking is ok. Thank god it had outhouses in the parking lot. At one end is the gift shop and food etc. The other end has the sign with the trail info to begin there. It doesn't matter which way you start. Not as packed as I thought it would be. But plan your trip wisely. If in tourist season get there early 7-9 am or you won't get parking. OR sleep in, organize the kids and get there for late lunch or dinner time. You're in the woods so a cooler time of day is best. Very well groomed trails. You cant get lost. You have your choice of a long or short hike. The more you hike the more you see. The path along the canyons and water are amazing. One trail loops around and is basically a trail running horizontally to the water trail but not much to see up there. I would have turned around and went back along the water trail again!. I couldn't stop taking pictures. Nice informational signs showing different birds, trees, plant species, history of this area. Great to stop and take a break for 30 seconds. The signs make the whole experience better because you'll start noticing all the stuff they're talking about. Its a great way to challenge kids to find everything on the sign. Make them read it and point out what they find. Bribe....I mean..... Reward them with ice cream as the prize haha. Anyways worth the trip. I was supposed to rock climb down these cliffs, on a tour, but I threw out my back brushing my teeth if you can believe it, so I couldn't go. That would have been awesome hanging right above the rapids and rushing water!\"\"Stunning as always, well worth the short drive south to see this beautiful location highly recommended\"\"Visited on route from Jasper to Banff on a very quiet day - there was only one other car in the car park. The falls are very close to the car park - 2 minute walk, but the walkway was very icy and could have been dangerous. But on arrival on the viewing bridge it was a spectacular site - falls were running under the ice and running through into a blue water channel through the canyon. Easy to access / great photo opportunity just off the main road.\"\"I've visited these falls before in summer and this time most of the falls were frozen BUT water was flowing and it was really interesting to see how the melt was being shaped by the water flow.Even in summer these falls are worth a visit, they're on the main route between Jasper lake Louise and Banff so there's no diversion necessary. The falls are 200 meters from the convenient car park very near the main road.\"Athabasca Falls is definitely worth the short drive and short walk to see the falls. It is a two or three minute walk from the parking lot. It is easy to see how the river cut through the rock if you stand and watch for a few minutes and just imagine the power. Walk over the bridge and take the trail to the right to the bottom.Easy access and paved pathways give access to this spectacular waterfall. The canyons are beautiful and there are stone staircase/steps that trail around part of the feature. Care should be taken and visitors should keep to the pathway. Climbing up on the outcrops can be dangerous and slippery (but I still saw people doing it while we were there). Benches and tables available for picnics.We had already done some hiking for the day and my children were tired so it was nice to be able to see this waterfall within steps of the parking lot. It isn't as spectacular in the winter but still beautiful. The road coming in was pitted and would be very rough for a car as the snow was melting but not much you can do about Mother Nature!They were nice but surprised they are not bigger--kind of icy walking the paths--had to hang onto the fence to prevent falling--maybe a bit of sand would help\"This is one of our favourite places to stop in the summer, these falls never disappoint us. We decided to check them out while they were frozen... they were amazing. No one in the parking lot. There is a short trek to the falls that was quite slick, but well worth the view. You need to stop here in the winter and the summer!\"\"Athabasca Falls has an extensive walkway and bridges around it, which gives you great views of the rushing water plummeting into the deep gorge and canyon. The turbulence of the water can be viewed from several aspects, one being right over it, so you can really appreciate the rushing water. It is said to have more volume ofvwater going over it than Niagara Falls. Beautiful scenery can be found all around the falls as well as on the route to it. Another great spot to stop in Jasper National Park.\"I have been to Athabasca Falls many times and in every season. It is never disappointing. The scenery is breathtakingly beautiful and well worth a visit! It is nice to check out in the less busy times as it can get quite crowded.\"Spring runoff made the walk glare ice. Brought boot traction aids and it made the trip much easier. Sport shops in town had them in adult small which fit our 3 and 5 year old kids, they loved it.\"\"30 mins south of Jasper are the spectacular falls. Definitely worth a visit. The walkways were very icy and slippery in March, but the short walk is worth the effort.\"A great little stop along the highway on your drive to Jasper from Banff or the other way around. A great little break for the kids in your car.\"If we say that The Niagara Falls are spectacular, then we would say that Athabasca Falls are charming. They just have different styles. The both are easily accessible. We're much closer to Niagara Falls ,so we hold the Athabasca Falls dearer.\"Short 15 minute walk to falls through the snow.Great shots of falls even though frozen..Lots of photo shots along the way.Dont get to close to frozen lake to get a better shot as a few people have lost their lives.\"With a powerful rush and roar, the falls drop 80 feet into a narrow gorge. You can see how water has carved the rock over eons. You can cross the gorge on a bridge, stopping mid way to gape from on high. It's a short walk from the parking lot.\"\"Before you get to Jasper, coming from Banff, first, it is very convenient to stop for a nice look at the Athabasca Falls, which are in Jasper National Park. There is a nice walkway or path that leads you to different viewpoints of the Falls. It is not a very large area, if there are a lot of people there at the same time as you are, you have to juggle your way around. But do stop for a look. Very pretty to see.\"Went to this place. It was beautiful. One must beware of the rainey season: the river can get really high and nasty.\"It was Spectacular... Well worth going for a look. We were driving down the highway and decided to stop for a look. WOW, what a sight, easy to walk to, the power of that Waterfall, what a site.\"\"We visited here in February so everything was frozen! Very scenic, great for photography but watch your step as the pathways were completely iced over.\"An extremely beautiful falls which is very easy to access. There is one spot where you can get fully wet from the drizzle from the falls. There is a trail from the falls which leads to a beautiful scenery.\"I have been to Athabasca Falls in summer and in winter it is so beautiful and impressive during both seasons! There are many view points and all parts around the Falls are fenced off! Please respect those railings, they are there for your safety!\"This falls drops 80 feet through a narrow gorge. An easy walking path takes you to see the top drop. There is a bridge over the gorge and multiple places to get great photos and videos. Mesmerizing and magnificent - the power of nature and the beauty of rock and water.A must see if you like water falls! Beautiful and powerful! Beautiful landscape! Just breath taking!\"Car park is located just off the highway within 1 minute drive, very short walk to the falls, with not too much of a hill. There is a trail around the falls so you can explore a bit more, not very strenuous to walk. Natural beauty and power of the falls is breathtaking\"\"About 20-25 minute drive south of Jasper, easy short walk from the parking lot. We went late February and the walkways and paths were super icy, so wear good footwear. So interesting to see the deep canyons and frozen waterfall, with pools of crystal-blue water swirling around. Definitely check out all the different viewpoints/lookouts, it's beautiful. Can't wait to come back in the summer to see the falls in all their glory!\"Always a hit to pitstop here with out of country friends or when travelling with kids or seniors.incredible photo ops.I actually recommend you to visit this place when it is warmer and in summer.. surely there's a beauty in frozen things but the life is frozen too .. it is super slippery and you will need cleats to go up and down..\"We arrived on a rainy morning--it was worth standing in the rain. Incredibly display of power, water, just amazing! Still got great photos (possibly even better ones than we'd have gotten if it were sunny).\"Beautiful in the winter when much of it is frozen. Worth the small walk from the road to get there. Highly recommend to anywhere driving through the icefield parkways.\"Enjoyed a lovely walk along the falls. The water gurgled underneath the frozen ice, and gigantic icicles lined the walls of the canyon! The photographs we took did not do it justice, it truly was breathtaking!\"\"We just happened to see the sign for the falls while driving and we were not disappointed , such an amazing view!\"\"Beautiful location in the summer, but also amazing in the winter with the frozen waterfall. Parking lot is plowed out in the winter. 30 km from Jasper, spend a half hour wandering around and enjoy the frozen falls. Stay on the pathway.\"\"If you're in the Jasper area, do yourself a favor and spend at least an hour to check out Athabasca Falls — it's one of the most beautiful places in all of Alberta!\"\"First of, it's free at this place. In fact, most of the places in Canada are free! This water fall is very beautiful, with loud thunder sound of the water running down crashing the rock. There's also a place where you white water raft for level 3 if you're an experience one. The natural rock formation is beautiful and to walk through it is quite a memory. Spend an hour or two and you'll enjoy the day.\"\"We stopped at Athabasca Falls on the way back to Jasper. It had been raining but stopped by the time we arrived. Because we left early, there was no one around and we had the place to ourselves. You can see our pictures at winenchocolate dot com\"We spent Sunday afternoon out at the Athabasca Falls. It was beautiful walking in the snowy area & seeing the magnificent falls. It was too dangerous to go to the lower falls.We went here on my Moose tour and i'm glad we did! It was a beautiful spot. We weren't here too long but we did a bit of exploring.\"If your looking for a quick day trip in Jasper that's convenient, beautiful and not to physically challenging then stop by to see the amazing waterfall at AthabascaEven more beautiful in the winter when it's frozen:)\"We did this hike in the winter so part of the trail was closed due to snow and ice on the stairs. This is a great little hike to stretch your legs on your drive along the Icefields parkway. It is very pretty.We had a awesome time walking down the trails to the river to take pictures looking back up the mountain. We have been in the fall and in the winter.\"A very busy place in early fall with many tourists. Paths are paved and fairly easy to navigate for all ages. More extensive trails can be accessed as well. A beautiful must-see attraction, however I prefer less busy times.\"\"If you want to experience the Rockies and their Falls this is a Great starting place. Easy access off of HWY 93, Beautiful scenery all the way to the falls. This is a great place to see in the summer and winter.\"My husband and I loved the Athabasca Falls. So amazingly beautiful and spectacular!! Lots of areas to explore with great walking trails. The water is like no where else. Beauty everywhere. Be ready with your camera and to be visually fulfilled.\"Beautiful views. We had the chance to raft down the Athabasca River (after the falls!) for about 10 miles. Not very scary, but the landscapes were beautiful and the guide was really knowledgeable.\"The waterfall is beautiful but the history of the falls can be seen by a short hike to the river's past channels gives you an unprecedented look back in time and see how water can cut and polish rock.This should definitely be on your must see list. Start with the falls and then head towards the canyon. You can take steps down and then you end up at the bottom of the falls after the canyon and it opens to a beautiful rock beach with views that are breathtaking. It's dog friendly and perfect for a photographer. We were also told it's one of the best places for star gazing at night. It's busy but we didn't feel overwhelmed and I would definitely go back if we were in the area again. It's on your way to reaching Jasper if you are coming from Banff or an easy 30+ minute drive from downtown Jasper. Enjoy!\"It was very beautiful. I went during the WInter and everything was frozen, but with the mountain in the background, it still looks and sounds amazing!\"\"Feel the the mist of spray on your face, view the rush of white water leaping down the canyon and listen to the roar of water crashing over rocks, plummeting down below the walking bridge. A great visit a short drive away from the town of Jasper, and directly on route from Jasper and Banff National Park. Stop and stretch your legs, take a bathroom break or have a relaxing picnic on a nearby bench,\"This is nature at it best and most wonderful. The walkways offer you so many different views of these magnificent falls.\"Gorgeous spot. This is a beautiful place for pictures, especially with the unique stairs built into the scenery. It was not crowded for me as we went right after a rain, but I can see how it would be a bit uncomfortable viewing with more people.\"\"The biggest canyon and waterfall I have seen! Superb!Quite accessible, mainly paved. Some areas inaccessible to those who cannot climb / scramble.\"\"This is a must stop when driving along the Icefields Parkway.The scenery & the power of the water is amazing.Very easy to walk around.Athabasca Falls won't disappoint.\"\"We checked out Athabasca falls while we were on vacation in Jasper in December. The scenery was amazing and the trails were well kept and easy to navigate. It was pretty awesome to see the falls , nature is pretty crazy. It was about 25 minutes from Jasper and we walked around for about 45 minutes before getting chilly and heading back to the car. Very pretty location, great place to check out if you have the time.\"The power of water amazes me. A must see if your visiting Jasper National Park. Extremely breath taking scenery.You must stop here when you are driving on the Icefields Parkway. The fall is very near the parking lot. We have seen a lot of falls in British Columbia and Alberta and we loved them all !\"Athabasca Falls are stunning, lovely walks and good paths. What spoils this area is the selfie stick tourist of which there were hundreds. They are not on the hiking path but in front of the falls not to take a picture of the falls but of themselves with a small amount of lovely blue water in the background. If you want to be shoved, kicked etc then that's the place for you! If you walk on you will find fewer people and equally stunning views.\"\"There are just SO MANY wonders of nature in the Rockies, that it is hard to even attempt to compare! This is one of those must-see attractions!\"\"This is a definite must-stop on the Ice Fields Parkway. The falls are enormous and create such a beautiful detail in the surrounding rock. Take all of the paths, there are different views all over. Paths are clean and easy to walk on. My favorite part was the small lake and basin after the falls. The water turns bright blue/green and all is calm after the falls. There is a long stairwell to get down to the basin with large steps and things to hold onto. Very touristy, go early in the morning when it's chilly to grab your photos.\"\"This was a gorgeous place to stop, and I'm so glad we did. Make sure to hike down too - you could spend a good hour here just enjoying the view - which we did.\"\"Worth a half hour stop, even in snow. Easy walk along pathway with fencing, beautiful views, spectacular falls\"\"If your driving the highway between Jasper & Banff, summer or winter, stop and see this place. There is some walking, but not very much, so most people can enjoy this place.\"\"Very impressive Waterfalls, Good Parking and not too far to walk. Bring Camera - Excellent viewing platforms.\"Second only to Niagra Falls this natural wonder is just plain fantastic. Easy to get to. Gentle walking trails. Plenty of parking and bathroom facility. Photographers are in their element with the landscape views and energy of the falls.\"Been 35 years since visited last. Wonderful view, able to appreciate the power of water/nature. Kids enjoyed the walk and the different view points\"Well worth a visit. Signposted from the road. Free parking. Takes around an hour overall. Powerful waterfall. Nice scenery.\"We have been to Athabasca Falls many times and it is always a treat to walk the trails. Standing on the bridge you have great views of the falls and it's great for picture taking. Despite the fact that there are signs warning people not to go over the fences there is always at least one fool who thinks the rules don't apply to them. On this visit there was once again a guy with a camera trying to get the best view, standing on wet rocks right at the edge of the falls. Obey the signs so you don't become a statistic!\"\"One of natures beautiful works.The falls are ordinary but the view is amazing once the falls flow down and cut through a gorge. The nice part from the visitors view is that U get to walk through the rocks and see the falls from different points. A history of the falls is written at the various points too, which is good information.The different layers of rocks, plants etc give the closest insight into the effects of erosion over hundreds of years. A commendable part was the singular toilet amidst the woods. I must say thank you to the Jasper tourism center for its provision in such wilderness. I took my 6 year old kid there and so had the closest look into one of the best accommodated toilets I seen. Sans flush, the WC runs at least a 100 feet deep into the ground! In all its wilderness, it was spacious, clean and with enough supply of toilet paper.\"This was a great place to stop. As well as the falls it is worth the effort to walk down the the bottom where te water flows into the river and to the pond.\"We stopped on our road trip from Calgary to Vancouver and although time was tight, we found the waterfalls would be worth adding to our next trip as a place to spend more time.\"\"Cool, cloudy day, a bit of rain here and there.....We enjoyed every second of our visit. Make sure you look up and down, go down the stairs, go down to the river edge, go for a walk by the river. Explore! You will not be sorry.Safe, well paved walk ways. Hold on to the rail at the more steep areas.\"\"Very enjoyable promenade. Magnificent views of the river, waterfalls, etc. Well indicated trails. Truly recomended.\"\"My husband and I from the UK have visited Canada several times over the years and I am always finding different things to comment on on Trip Advisor so this one is a long time coming.This is a stunning tourist spot, the first time we visited several years ago and on a revisit more recently. You cannot imagine the power of the water and the noise until you see these amazing falls. It is very accessible to able bodied and also to those that may not be quite so mobile so everyone is catered for to see this wonderful spectacle.Because of its popularity it can be very busy and quite crowded especially around the car park areas so be aware, and you do have to navigate crowds of people but it is worth it in the end. A must see, and one beautiful photograph I took is framed and on our wall at home, so every day, even in England we see these amazing falls!\"\"Gorgeous views, easy access paths. This place is very tourist-y which is not my favourite thing but the views are too beautiful to pass up! Disappointing how some people disrespect nature and feel the need to litter. Well worth the visit, though.\"\"Athabasca Falls are beautiful and an absolute must stop. I can't imagine coming all the way to Jasper and not stopping here. The Canadian Park Service did a great job designing and building the path system to accommodate all visitors no matter what their abilities. The signage was informative and easy to understand. Yes, I am sure that it can be very crowded especially in the summer. We were there on a drizzly day and it was not crowded at all. Maybe stopping in the early morning or later in the early evening would help avoid the crowds. Everyone in my family loved it .\"\"Since I love waterfalls, I had to add this attraction to the list. Lots of tourists but still worth visiting. Not far from Jasper.\"Incredible rock formations and good interpretive walk signage. Not too far from town so go see an amazing display of the power of water over time.Athabasca Falls are very popular. The trail is well maintained and an easy walk. Great for all ages.\"I absolutely *LOVE* waterfalls, but I hated this one. You park, walk through a maze of tourist buses, navigate hoards of rude tourists, none of which speak English, and the waterfall isn't even that great. Zero tranquility here. The tour guide drivers are also miserable to deal with- they'll shove you out of the way while a family takes 300 selfies. I walked down to the area closer to the riverbed hoping that maybe that would be more enjoyable, but it wasn't really.Do yourself a favor and don't stop here- Jasper has other, much better, waterfalls.\"\"i thought I had taken a wrong turn and was so disappointed that we'd missed the falls. Kids were tired and cranky, then I come across the sign to the falls -Yay! Kids said nah, don't worry - of course mum spat the cheque and said we didn't come all this way to miss this. Got grumpy 1 and grumpy 2 out the car upon arrival and they were completely amazed, such stunning views, awesome falls, amazing how calm the water can be, then turns into a raging fall, good little walking trail, seen a double rainbow over the falls as well. We were all very happy after that to continue our drive.\"\"These waterfalls are incredibly beautiful, would definitely recommend stopping here on the road to/ from Jasper. Lots of informative signs, pretty easy access to all areas, predominantly kid-friendly. Also saw two tiny dogs in tiny coats so if you are looking to see these then this is probably one of your best bets in Alberta.\"Not to be missed. Exceptional natural beauty. Carved by water and weather. Easy access and careful walking for everyone.\"Although not a high waterfall, the sheer volume of water means that it roars as it plunges into the deep, narrow gorge it has carved out over time. Allow at least 1/2 hour to enjoy and photograph the falls from the various platforms providing different views. It is only a short distance along a wide, flat path from the car park to the viewing platforms at the top so this attraction is suitable for strollers and wheelchairs.It is a nice little climb down the stairs, through the gorge to the bottom for a different perspective again.Strongly recommend making this one of your stops if traveling the Icefield Parkway.\"\"This is a very impressive Fall, not very far from the roadway, easy to park the car, a short distance walk is required, good for family trip. You can get real close to the fall and watch the water falling off the cliff. Nice view.\"\"Love these falls, so easy to get to just outside of Jasper, pavement access, wheelchair accessible. Well, worth the short walk. I went in November and had the whole place to my self. I walked up the river as well for more beatiful scenery. Nice place to stretch your legs and get some great pictures!\"I like that there were signs with information about the falls - a self guided interpretive trail made it more interesting. Good stop to make not far from town if you want to see something but don't have all day.Glad I had gloves and a beanie because it was -10 the morning out tour took us which make for sharp photos.Gets very busy with tour buses so go early but rug up and enjoy the thundering falls.Rained the whole time but still enjoyed the trails. The views were breath taking and it was still very busy considering the poor weather.Well worth a stop- pleasant stroll to various viewpoints of waterfalls and canyon of glacier blue water amongst leafy green vegetation.\"Being right beside the highway this is an easy and worthwhile stop. This is not a particularly high falls, but the water volume going over the falls is large, and watching the water thunder over the falls can be hypnotic. There are some short trails that take you to different viewpoints for different perspectives. Whatever you do, DO NOT climb over the fences for that \"\"perfect photo\"\". The rocks get slippery from all the moisture and spray, and people lose their lives here far too often by ignoring the fences and slipping into the falls.For most visitors, I'd recommend budgeting 20 or 30 minutes for this stop, as that's long enough to take in the views and admire the falls.\"\"near to the highway and accessible for all. great views of the falls from the bridge over the gorge or from closer when clambering down the paths. some of the path is a little worn in places now and slippy when wet, but great photo opportunities\"\"Beautiful falls, nice walking area. A must great stop along the way to other places. Can spend 30 minutes or hours depending on the day and what you want to do.\"\"There is a short walk from the parking lot to the falls, though it looks like you could extend the hike further.\"Very spectacular place to go. For me It's a must see place in Jasper. Very busy all year round. Bring your camera.This is close to the road and worth the stop if you're driving past. It does have a lot of visitors however and those that visit evidently aren't able to figure out what a rubbish bin is. It is scenic although there are many falls like it along the highway and amongst hiking trails.Very pretty falls which take about half an hour in total to visit each viewpoint. The force of water is very strong as the river plunges into a narrow canyon where the water then turns to a deep turquoise. The pathway and steps round the falls are very well maintained and signed. There are good barriers along the path which clearly state you must not climb over them. There is even a plaque which tells the sad fate of a boy who died. Yet whilst we were there several Chinese visitors still climbed over with their tripods to stand perilously close to the edge and in doing so in considerately blocked the view for everyone else. I asked them to move but they only did momentarily. Hopefully people reading this review who may be inclined to do the same might consider why it is not right to do so and refrain from doing so.Mind blowing and fantastic.. its such a wonder it just amazes me how beautiful it is in there the crystal blue water was impressive definitely a bucket list goal :)\"Athabasca falls are so beautiful any time of the year. It's a very short walk off the highway, you'll be pleasantly surprised.\"\"Found this falls to be one of the best on our entire trip, fantastic views. Very well presented in as much as many walkways with hand rails as required. I feel we benefitted by visiting later in the year as I can imagine this place could very easily become overcrowded.\"\"I could never get bored of seeing all the gorgeous glacial waterfalls and rivers in this part of Canada, but this was just amazing, if not one of the best we saw. This is situated at the Jasper end of the Icefield Parkway and really did set the scene for what was to come!There are plenty of information boards dotted around the site, which are quite educational for the whole family. The crashing waterfall with the mountain backdrop was breath taking, but the most gorgeous and serene part was down at the bottom, where the waterfall gave way to a quieter ice blue river. Although it was freezing, I could've spent hours there!\"\"This place was an awesome place to go hiking and to take some beautiful photos, I couldn't believe how long the hikes were, which was a huge highlight in my opinion. Some of the views are from high above so if you are afraid of heights it may be best to go with someone you trust.\"Athabasca was my favourite waterfall of the trip... & we did a lot of water falls! The key here is to look at it from all the angles.. The other side has a great viewVery scenic walk. More than one pathway to walk..take your pick.All trails are marked and accessible. Safety rails line most pathways..enjoy!One of the most beautiful falls that we saw during our trip. Close to Jasper town and easily reachable.After doing the Cavell Meadows hike we drove down Rt. 93a to Athabasca Falls at it’s junction with the Icefields Parkway. There are restrooms and picnic tables at the parking lot. The falls are right next to the lot. The Athabasca River narrows converging its waters to form a wall of water that flows over the falls and under a bridge through a gorge. There are great photos of the falls with snow covered Evelyn Peak in the background and of the blue green waters rushing through the deep gorge as the river continues on. Did this review earn a “helpful vote?We loved touring the falls. Two out of Five of us have disabilities yet we were still able to enjoy the falls by taking a shorter walk around the falls. Amazing views. Locd it.\"Definitely worth doing. Lovely mountain views in the background. We actually saw a mink while we were there. It can get busy, but worth the visit.\"\"Throughout our drive from Lake Louise to Jasper, this is the best place to go. The falls are really beautiful and we are lucky to visit it during a sunny day. However the washrooms are not very clean, so be sure to look out for washrooms whenever you can throughout your drive.\"\"Didn't expect ourselves to enjoy this stop so much after three days in Jasper. We planned make a stop here on our way from Lake Louise, but decided to delay the stop until the day we drive back to Yoho, and that was a good decision, as we would not have had enough time to spend time here on the way to Jasper. The walk to the lower canyon was a lot more interesting, with the colorful and interestingly textured canyon walls, the falls, and the river at the bottom.\"\"Once again, this country just keeps on giving with scenery, absolutely spectacular. The Athabasca Falls were amazing, so much to see and take in, I would recommend stopping here for a look on your trip.\"\"Beautiful thundering waters, try and explore the whole area as there are some lovely walks around that give different views of the falls.\"\"Just a great spot, easy to access and nice walks along the river and falls area. Picnic areas, toilets etc and the falls themselves not huge but beautifully interesting.\"\"A great place to visit. Plenty of room for all the tour buses and you. Beautiful in all ways. We saw it just after a new fallen snow and it was incredible, definitely a must see on this route. Much more impressive, in my view, than the ice fields. Oh and it's free.\"\"A must-see in Jasper! Be sure to take the walk down to the river. The place really reminds one of nature's power and beauty in its raw, unspoiled state\"\"This place is busy, but worth the trip. Nice falls, lots of water pushing through. Take the path down to the river, water is cold!\"\"The color of the water was amazing milky blue. The rock formations were intriguing and highly photogenic. It is best to stick to the paths and hold on to the handrails. If the ground is slippery, it is important to use good judgment and refrain from continuing if it feels unsafe or might be too much work to get back up.\"Spectacular falls easily reached from the road and then from the car park - several different short trails are all worth following for different views of the glorious falls and the surrounding country. If you're here you'd be foolish to miss.Easy walk in from the parking area even in snowy and slippery conditions. An extremely photogenic piece of nature and we'll worth the visitWe stopped here on our way to Banff. We spent about half an hour walking from the top of the falls down to the river. Was a really enjoyable stop. Great photo opportunities as well.\"They aren't the biggest or baddest falls, but they're pretty neat. If you take the time to read the plaques and boards you can learn a lot about the local area. What makes these falls so cool is the age of them and to see the eroded rock where the water has been flowing for many moons.\"\"We stopped here while driving through Jasper National Park, and this is a place you do not want to miss! It's simply an awesome example of nature's unique artwork. And it's right off the main highway!\"\"After going on the Maligne Lake Cruise, I still had enough energy to hit Athabasca Falls and what a Hi-light. I must have taken 300 pictures as I couldn't believe the colour of the water and canyon in the rocks that the waterfall had hollowed out. The walk down to the bottom was filled with picturesque views and I had my camera clicking at every turn. I couldn't believe how much there was to see and would recommend the trip to everyone old or young.\"\"Crazy busy place, full of tour busses. It's beautiful to see but I wouldn't want to spend very long there.\"We visited while on a tour out of Jasper. Its difficult not to take hundreds of photos in this area.\"Went here as part of the icefields parkway trip. Was beautiful lovely photographic opportunities. Time allowed not quite long enough, would have spent longer. We had 20 minutes there.\"\"I highly recommend this trip to anyone who visits Jasper, its a short drive from Jasper. The short hike to the falls is well worth it, I have visited the falls both in summer and winter and personally in the winter months I find the falls to be and their best.\"This is a must stop location along the Columbia Ice Parkway. Lots of parking and easy trails to explore the area. Count on spending at least one hour checking out all of the sights. Amazing to see how the water has carved out the rock over time.\"Didn't know what to expect, but nearly lost my camera when I looked down!!! That's friggin amazing! (Hope you know what that means?) An incredible natural demonstration of the force of water, and an unbelievable gift shop. A must see!!\"The falls were beyond awesome. The trails are clean and manageable and the vistas are beyond magnificent. A must see\"Stopped off on a Brewster coach trip to Jasper from Banff. Although the falls are not particularly large as falls go it comes from the Athabasca river, a fast flowing mountain river, with a spectacular backdrop of part of the Rockies. In the river there are twenty species of fish downstream but only one above the falls, such is the barrier. Worth a visit though.\"These falls are easy access from Icefields Parkway and are absolutely stunning. There are interactive signs to explain the history of the water flow\"This is off the road, but well worth the stop. Stunning falls, and a nice little hike for those who want to wander.\"Athabasca Falls are well worth a side visit on the way through with stunning scenery around every corner. The first part of the walk is fine for most abilities but the further down you go the further up you have to walk and it gets mighty steep in place especially if you take the route through the trees as opposed to walking back up the side of the falls.\"When you arrive, you don't know quite what to expect. The trail opens up more and more of the water rushing down this series of narrow passages through the stone. It is a special experience.\"\"There are a number of falls you can visit and should think they are better seen when snow melt is at its height or when frozen. Having said that, falls are free to view (assumed you have already purchased park pass) and information boards give you an idea about how the falls formed. Accessed by short walk from car park.\"Beautiful place to visit for a stop off and photo opportunity. Great scenery surrounding the falls. And gorgeous blue at the bottom. Must stop visit.\"Stop by here on your drive to Jasper from Banff. It's right off the Icefields parkway. Parking was limited in August. We didn't spend a ton of time here (about thirty minutes) and were able to see the falls and go on a brief paved walk, as opposed to actual hiking. There were lots of families here and dogs too!\"\"The falls are a must. Stunning scenery. Water falls thundering hundreds of feet to the river below. Well maintained walking tracks and stairs. Park notes regarding the history and creation of the falls very informative. This was a highlight of our trip to Jasper. The top of the falls has easy walking tracks, stairs for the fitter take you lower down to river level\"Great little place to go. Parking is close by so you don't have to walk very far. Worth the 15 minute pit stop for sure!\"Arrive really, really early. We got there before the first tourist bus arrived and had the place to ourselves. It is an incredible sight and amazing to see. I'm so glad I got myself out of bed to be there when I was.\"\"The rapids, waterfall and turquoise blue water cascading through the narrow crevice is really impressive and picturesque and well worth a photo opportunity.\"Amazing scenery and nice walk to the falls. A must see when you are in West-Canada. Much more recommended than the Athabasca Glacier which was very dissapointed.A sign from the highway easily points you in the right direction of the falls and it's an easy walk to the viewing area of the falls. They are thundering and are just beautiful. A great photo stop and it's free. Worth taking the time to stop.You can choose to do a range of hikes around here or just a quick stop as we didt o stretch our legs and see the falls. It's nothing spectacular.The Falls are easily accessible - an average walk from the parking on relatively flat terrain. Really enjoyed everything about our visit to the falls. They are really beautiful.\"We visited on a day which was cloudy and a little rainy and it added to the dramatic thunder of these wonderful falls. Definitely worth it to stop there for a while and marvel at what nature will do unaided if we let it! Unbelievably, we saw people risking their lives and going beyond the barriers to take photos although the dangers are pointed out everywhere. Accidents can and do happen because of this kind of reckless behaviour and it is not what anyone would want the Falls to be associated with.\"\"Called in on our way past and glad we did, quite busy but walk a short way as most visitors stop at the top!\"\"Please take the time to check out the falls. The unique trails are a must see. Not so great if you have a wagon or stroller, but a relatively easy walk\"\"Wonderful place to visit, specifically the canyon, about 10 minutes walking from the falls, it has beautiful stone rocks which carved by erosion millions years ago, this place is free of charge, you only have to pay the permit for Jasper national parks, worth to visit definitely\"Athabasca Falls is a short drive from Jasper that can be done in a morning. Paved walkways around the falls area make it an easy hike. Great scenery for picture taking.\"This is a paved, easy walk but there are some stairs. There are beautiful views of the rushing water. If you're short on time, avoid the path through the tunnel that leads to the canyon/pothole; left is where the action is. It's a popular stop for tour buses so it will likely be crowded.\"The walk to the falls was not difficult. The color of the water was a beautiful shade of blue. We recommend this to anyone.\"A must see if you are in Jasper! Has always been my most favourite place - the rushing water, the carved rock and the full spectrum of greens from the trees, grass, flowers and moss.Make sure you walk the full train to get views of the falls from all points. The paved trails are well maintained and very walkable.\"Beautiful and impressive. Just be prepared for bus loads of tourists elbowing their way to the best photo spots.There is a lovely easy walk to see the falls and the river. It is a beautiful area and well worth a stop to see it all.\"Literally! My words can barely begin to describe the beauty of this spot, located in Canada's Jasper National Park. A brief stop on Route 93 and within a short walk from the parking lot, is one of the more beautiful spots I've seen - anywhere! The turquoise water from the glacier melts in the Canadian Rockies, the river meets a narrow spot where you can see, and witness, the power of the rapids as they literally eat through the rock, creating a breathtaking sight. I've included a few pictures which barely show the power and majesty of the river and falls. I highly recommend this stop which is easily accessible to most everyone.\"\"Impressive waterfall that is easily accessible from the parking lot. There is a paved sidewalk around the falls viewpoints, as well as steps down to the lower canyon. I recommend going to the lower canyon which will take you to the river. You get a feeling of the rainforest with all of the green lichen on the rocks, the ferns and plants as you walk down the steps. Also take the sidewalk to the side view of the falls, which definitely looks different than the first view you get. The river is very wide here with beautiful mountains in the background; this backdrop with the rushing water of the falls makes for impressive photo opportunities. Warning: Do Not use the outhouse in the parking lot.\"\"Be sure to explore the falls themselves and surrounding viewpoints.The water color is amazing in this place and its a very short detour from Icefield Parkway, definitely a must for those driving through.\"\"A really pretty place to visit and take some photographs, plenty to see and very dramatic scenery. We were lucky enough to visit on a beautiful day and it wasn't too busy.\"\"The glacial water is truly amazing. The site is crowded with tour buses, so go early or late in the day.\"This stop doesn't take much out of your time and is well worth it. Beautiful waterfall and viewing points of the river along the way. Easy flat quick walk.This should definitely be part of your exploration of the Canadian Rockies. The fast flowing river gushes through the narrow gorges carving out narrow ravines and waterfalls.So easy to access these falls and such a fantastic sight. As everywhere we have been in the area the information boards provide exceptional insights into the flora and fauna and the history etc of the pace. If you drive the Icefield Parkway make sure you stop here. Just a short trip back from Jasper too.\"Allow yourself a good half hour to walk around the falls area, there is plenty to see. The falls themselves are fascinating to watch that amount of water charge through, and the walk to the Lake below is well worth it.\"\"We stopped at these falls for a short while on a coach tour from Banff to Jasper. Time constraints limited our visit to the top section of the Falls, where the river commences the downward path into the canyon to the lower falls and onwards. The width for the very large volume of water is constrained as it descends over rocks providing an impressive sight. As is the case at many of these good standard view points in Canada surfaced parking and clean washroom facilities are provided. The scenery is very good and warrants the short diversion from the main Icefields Parkway to reach the Falls.\"\"Part of the Banff-Jasper trip, but an experience in itself. Not too far from the carpark and paths reasonably walkable without too much up and down. Good views across the river to the mountains and then of the falls themselves.\"Lovey waterfall and worth the time to stop. Water is a great colour and the rock erosion is very interesting.\"Don't miss this site close to Jasper on way to icefields. Really enjoyed. Water is stunning blue. Good pathways, carpark, wc.\"its a waterfall very pretty but nothing much to do there apart from stop take a photo and move on . very cold so didnt stay long here not sure if there is a cafe nearby or notA lookout spot that is definately worth a stop on a road trip. The natural bridge is a wonderous sight and the water is so clear and blue. If you like natural beauty this is a must.This falls is one of the best so make time to stop. It is an easy walk to see all the areas and do take the trip down to the end where the view is different but very lovely.\"We arrived before 9am, way before all the bus loads of tourists started arriving. Moment of peace seeing the falls, and going down to the canyon when there was just a couple of other people around. Soon after >20++ people arrived by the busload and stomped the place. We were glad for the moment of peace and even gladder when the tourists left.\"We enjoyed the views throughout the trails and the scenic beauty is quite memorable. A great photo opportunity stop.This is another one of those stops that you don't want to miss when visiting Jasper. The views of the falls are lovely but don't miss the lower canyon...it's amazing! It's a bit of climbing both up and down but it's usually a fairly easy hike. More difficult if it's raining. Love it!Do stop at Athabasca Falls on your way to Jasper. They are stunning. It makes a really nice break in your trip. You can spend as much time walking around as you want but the Falls are well worth seeing.\"A short walk to the fall from the parking lot, it was crowded and a bit disappointed of the size of the fall.\"We went to the falls on the way to the Icefields Parkway. it was an easy hike and the falls are lovelyThis was another beautiful falls that we've seen on our trip! The one thing that separates this from many of the others is it's easy access from the parking area which for people who aren't able to take a long hike may be an advantage.\"Nothing much to see from the carpark and I thought \"\"another lot of falls\"\", but to my surprise, they were absolutely beautiful and worth the effort. Gentle walking tracks and certainly a good place to stretch your legs and breath some nice fresh country air.\"The falls are well worth a visit. There are a couple of short strolls around the short canyon and along the river. There is a trail that leads up and crossed the road and onwards to Geraldine Lake. Certainty worth a stop and a stroll around. Very popular and can get busy.\"An easy walk from the parking lot brings you to this amazing view. You can walk around and get some great shots if you're into photography, or just chill on a rock (hopefully under the sun ...)\"\"If you don't stop and visit the falls on your trip between Banff and Jasper, you missed a beautiful sight!Allow hour to visit, or more if you do the longer trails.\"\"Loved walking around this falls. Great place to spend some time.Easy walk with a lot of different views and sites to look at.\"\"We made a quick visit early, it is worth spending a little time here. Get here early because we were very soon swamped by many coachloads of visitors. did not spoil visit.\"\"The are lots of average to nice waterfalls on the road between Banff and Jasper. But this was the nicest Falls, lake and rock formations on the road to Jasper, bring your camera, stay one hour isn and enjoy\"\"Interesting place to visit when driving through the Icefields Parkway. Powerful falls, very impressive.\"\"A popular destination so be prepared for crowds and if you can go very early or late. An easy walk to the falls, people of all ages were there. Very beautiful with stunning rock formations.\"\"We saw many waterfalls on our journey, but this one and the surrounding canyons was just amazing! We spent a while there just listening to the thundering waterfall and then walking the pathways alongside the canyon walls as the water flowed through into a lake. The water was a beautiful shade of blue and was an even deeper shade in the canyon. To us, this was the highlight of the parkway and is not to be missed!\"\"I liked Athabasca Falls because of its pretty mountain backdrop and magical water colour. The falls itself that exciting, but it possesses enough power to carve a gorge immediately downstream of it. The gorge becomes deeper the lower into the canyon the Athabasca River goes.We were able to experience this waterfall by doing a very short walk along its extensive and very busy walkways and bridges. These paths skirt the gorge immediately downstream of the falls. You have views on both sides and some of the interesting geology of the gorge itself.I didn't do the walk that leads you further downstream deeper into the lower canyon. I was amazed at the colour of the water, a lighter blue and milky appearance. The color impressed us and adds to the waterfall's scenic allure. A protruding rocky island in the middle of the Athabasca River actually splits up the Athabasca Falls and as a result you are able to observe dual segments from the overlooks surrounding the falls. With a little luck you might see a faint rainbow in the rising mist of one of the waterfall.\"Part of out sightseeing tour of Jasper. Beautiful scenery and waterfalls as they flow down several levels and create bowls in the rocks. They weren't in full flow in August but when they are it will be spectacular.Stunning falls.. Short trek and easy to get to the falls. Beautiful and serene. Glad this was in the list of places we visited around Jasper.Worth the stop to take photos of these falls. Fed from Glacier melt so good water over the falls even in SeptemberWe stopped off at this attraction on the way to Jasper and almost skipped it. So glad we didn't! Amazing views and nice trails.\"Just a short detour off the Iceland Parkway are the beautiful Athabasca Falls. Promoted as small but powerful they are indeed a photographers delight. Within a very short walking distance from the main car park you encounter the wonderful Falls experience. A must see as you explore the amazing \"\"Rockies\"\"!\"The weather was pouring down but it was still worth taking a look at this beautiful spot. There's plenty of parking and toilets and some good photos to take. It wasn't busy either.\"If you are a fan of waterfalls you should definitely visit Athabasca Falls! Large parking place is available for cars, it´s accesible for all ages. I´d recommend to go there early in the morning to avoid crowds since it´s very popular atraction.\"\"This is a must see, don't forget you camera for this one. you will not be disappointed. The waterfall falls out from the side of the Mountain, and the views are breath-taking.\"\"Visit this place early (day break) and you have the falls all to yourself. Pack yourself a breakfast and you can enjoy the sounds of the water with your breakfast.Overall walk takes less than 30mins and entrance to falls very close to car park, no hiking required.\"These are really easy to see. It's only a short walk from the car park to the falls. There are a number of viewing points and a few information signs. This is a great place to spend an hour whilst driving along the Icefields Parkway (easy access from the main and scenic roads).Absolutely amazing Falls and slot Canyon. The pathways are abundant and offer amazing vantage points along the Canyon. I highly recommend this beautiful and powerful place.Definitely worth going in to. The walk is nice and easy and the viewing platforms were excellent. Would take the time.You have to visit the falls. It's obviously a bit of a tourist trail but well worth the visit. Not too far to walk\"This was a stunning visit and such an easy stop along the highway. There is plenty of parking with some coaches turning up too. We got there between 0930-1030 and it was fairly busy, we had got there just before a coach load. The falls have informative signs, but the power of the falls is incredible. Plenty of different areas to go to up close or at the end of the falls, which was the calm after the storm. Would highly recommend.\"Worth a quick stop enroute. Impressive waterfall & gorge. Plenty of parking although busy. Toilets are basic.Took my family who came from out of province to see the beauty of the falls. The falls are breathtaking and the colour of the water is gorgeous. You could stay there for hours just staring at them. This is a sight you don't want to miss.Dramatic and interesting and very accessible to all people. They have a wonderful system of ramps and viewing platforms including some steps down an abandoned stream bed from when the river moved. Really thoughtful and informative. We spent over 30 minutes climbing around and taking photos. It is Great!\"After seeing so many falls in Banff and Jasper, we were contemplating if we should do this at all with a 5 yr old but our decision to check this off the list was all worth it. It's a easy walk to the falls and the view is spectacular and you also get to see spot which might be a huge falls in about 100yrs. This would just take about an hour if you are just doing the falls.\"We stopped here on our drive from Jasper to Banff. It was breathtakingly beautiful... even in the rain! We had a nice walk to the various viewing spots. It was busy with visitors.\"The falls are pretty high and spectacular because of the volume of water and the narrow gorge it's pushed through. the falls are quite safe to visit, as long as you don't climb over the fence. They are also very accessible as they are only 100 meters from the parking lot and you can get very close to the falls. well worth a detour!\"A very nice high volume waterfall. Easy to get to with lots of viewing platforms. Would rate in top 25 of falls we have visited. In Canadian Rockies would rank it second only to Takakkaw Falls in Yoho Nat. Park.You pass close by between Jasper and Lake Louise - is a great free attraction - highly recommended for all ages and petsWould love to have spent more time here. Follow the river along and see the falls which were stunning and so close. The colour of the water is amazing - spend some time here.Can be very busy on the afternoon but worth the stop. Would recommend a look or hike around on the trails.Fun waterfalls to see. There are a lot of trails to explore not far from the parking lot. The falls were very powerful falling into the canyon below.Although we knew we were going to stop here for a photo stop whilst on a tour to the glaciers we visited separately and spent ninety minutes exploring. Spend time and this natural wonder will reward you.\"We had heard that this place gets really crowded so the advice was to get there early. We took this advice and were there soon after nine o'clock. However, there were already two coaches in the parking lot so the place was quite busy and it was necessary to push and shove in order to get a decent view of the falls. The Falls themselves are quite stunning with narrow channels full of rushing waters. The drop in level is not great but the sheer volume of water makes these quite exciting. But, oh the crowds, by the time we left there were seven coaches parked in the car park.\"\"The waterfalls was very full when we visited. Nice walk around the falls and canyon. Good photo ops.Can get slippery around falls when wet.\"\"We went to visit the falls mid day and it was a little busy, we were still able to get great pictures. I would suggest this attraction would probably be quieter in the morning. Very beautiful with many differnet great look out spots/photo spots. You can also walk down the old canyon where the water fall used to run.\"If you drive from south park way to Jasper you should not miss this one. It took about 30 minutes to visit this falls. Few view points are very close to the falls and you do feel its power. The trails and parking are crowds as well.lovely place to visit if you can get there before the crowds. worth getting up early for. good photo opportunityShort walk to a lovely waterfall. The river is beautiful and it looked like a great hike. A lot of viewing points.This is definitely one of the must see photo stops along highway 93. You only need a short time from your travel day.Well worth seeing on our trip around the Rockies. There were plenty of viewing platforms giving wonderful views of the falls.\"A must stop! The whole area is beautiful, but the waterfalls are just amazing! The volume of water flowing over them is truly awe inspiring!\"Athabasca Falls are beautiful. The color is amazing. There are different levels to view the falls and canyon. It was easy enough to get there and is right off the highway and a large parking lot.What a beautiful area! The trails and parking accommodate the crowds well. We took a picnic but wound up eating in the car as there really wasn't any place to sit.\"The falls are great, a narrow gorge with sheer rock and the green waters of the Athabasca River falling through them. The concrete walkways crossing the river give you great views of the falls and the River both upstream and downstream.Parking was tight, but we managed to park with no problems. There are restrooms.\"\"Nice short excursion to see the water falls, canyons, beach area and walk around. Walk was nice and gentle. Great place for pics!\"Close to the highway & a short walk from the parking lot. Numerous steps required to see the falls from several angles. This is one of the highlights in Jasper Nat'l Park between Jasper & the Columbia ice fields.The falls are impressive. There are two benches that memorialize two young people who slipped and fell to their death (on different occasions). Be careful.\"Every time we go to Jasper, we take a trip out to Athabasca Falls and it never gets old ... they are truly awesome! We usually drive the quieter highway from Jasper that can be found when you turn off to Edith Cavell. There are a couple of beautiful picnic spots along the way that are really quiet - we like the Meeting of the Two Rivers.\"Stunning waterfalls and would look fantastic in the winter when frozen. Well worth a visit. Would definitely recommend.\"Great instruction on notice boards and easy to get round, walkways provided amazing views of the falls but don't miss the view of the lower canyon from the road but mind the traffic.\"An easy walk to see beautiful falls high above gorges-takes about a half hour and right off the highway from Banff to jasper. Definitely include this on your trip!A short 25 minute drive out of Jasper will bring you to these falls. Although not spectacular by Niagra scale they are well worth a visit especially on a dull or rainy day.Stopped off here on the way to the glacier. The place was heaving so my advice is to go early as these falls are not to be missed. Around every corner is different view. Spectacular.Very close to the waterfall. Impressive to see the power of the water. Impressive are the potholes created by the falls over centuries. Nice walking paths around the falls.The color of the water and the depths of the canyon was breathtaking. There's lots of beautiful foliage and waterfalls.WOW. These falls were absolutely gushing. Beautiful easy trails with spectacular views. Don't miss this stop.\"Another natural attraction degraded by it's popularity. Roaring water, swirling azure pools and the occasional beer can. Close to the main road, and crisscrossed by boardwalks the accessibility is great but makes for it's on demise.\"The athabaska falls are great; there are several points to be walked around and hiked around which is fantastic. We had a great time exploring it all with the kid and ourselves. At the same time its a great way to spend the energy after a good breakfast in Jasper and have kids run around for a while.\"Great stop along the Icefield parkway just out of Jasper. Very short walk to falls, highly accessible from the parking area. Very much worth your time for a photo stop. Best photos taken in the afternoon to early evening.\"This place is worthy of a stop on any trip past! We kept running out of time and so bypassing it but then ended up extending our stay in jasper and heading down there and to then a couple of other spots. My two yr old thought it was awesome.Great place to check out when visiting Jasper with a baby. The paths to view the falls are stroller friendly and aren't very far from the parking lot (so it isn't a huge time commitment and you can get back to your vehicle quickly if baby fusses). Plus it is Soooo beautiful!\"During trip from Banff to Jasper we were subjected to rain, but the mountains were mainly still visible and although we understand good weather would have made it better it is hard to believe that itcoculd have been better. An awesome drive. We pulled in to Athabasca falls and when we approached the waterfalls the noise intensified and it was amazing to hear and see the force of the water. An awesome experience! Must do!\"It's a challenging bike ride or an easy drive.... if you rent a car your not on anyone else's time click to leavewe loved our visit here. Nature at its best and most powerful but why people ignore the warnings and risk their lives by going beyond the barriers is beyond me.\"We stopped at the Athabasca Falls en route from Jasper to Banff. The car park is just off the highway and the falls are only a short walk away, and worth doing. Very beautiful falls, lots of different vantage points, great photo opportunities. Thoroughly recommend.\"Beautiful and stunning. Many different viewpoints on site. Has lower and upper areas to be seen and of course mountains in the background.\"Love love the fall. Do not miss it. Beautiful, powerful and magnificent. Words and picture cannot describe it. You must not miss it on the way to experience it.\"This is a very cool place with a little bit for everyone. It's easily accessible for everyone and you can get very close up to the falls as well as the canyon. This is a must see for all.\"These falls are spectacular and you can get so close to them. A great reward at the end of the Icefield Parkway. Lots of options for overlooks. You can take a few steps to an overlook or hike around a bit. Also, the back road out of the falls off the main highway was a nice little drive and we saw a black bear along the road.\"\"This place is a MUST stop if you're in the Jasper area. I would recommend coming early or going late in the afternoon to keep away from the crowds and even then, you will not be alone. The falls area has a lot of viewpoints to look at and take pictures. You can even walk down a path where the falls used to go and look up at the giant carved away canyon walls. It is so picturesque. The falls are very close to the parking lot, so no long hike, but there are stairs you need to go up and down around the attraction. Make sure you have lots of memory in your camera for this place. We spent a good 45 to 1 hour just exploring all the view points and getting great shots. You could do it in less than an hour or stay longer. LOVE IT!!!!\"\"These falls are truly great. You got viewing points from all different angles. If you drive on the 93 highway than make sure to stop here. Take about a good 30 minutes to check out all the views.Enjoy!\"\"This is just off the Icefield parkway, and is an easy walk to several viewpoints of the falls, and channels the river has carved.\"Athabasca Falls is among the largest of the falls on the Jasper side of the Icefields Parkway. The falls are powerful and have carved quite a magnificent gorge out of the rock. Impressive to see and easy to get to (a short walk from parking). Can be slippery so wear good shoes!Absolutely beautiful but very cold. There is a very good cafeteria that does a very wide range of food from full cooked to light snacks.\"Popular falls and plenty of parking, but can be crowded. We were there early - about 9 am on a Sunday - and after about 30 minutes, the crowds started, so we had the best of the time. Access to the falls is easy and vantage points are many, to either admire them or to photograph them - and there was plenty of water. The falls aren't high compared to others we had seen, but they are well worth a visit and the walk around.\"Well worth a visit. Easy access and easy to move around and get good views despite large numbers of a certain type of traveller who always want selfie pictures and videos.Those annoying selfies stocks should be banned from all tourist spots as those operating them have no regard for others wanting to enjoy the sights and sounds!This is a majestic place........Not far off the road are the Athabasca Falls. If you enjoy watching waterfalls this is the place for you. A lot of water traveling through a small gap. Very dramatic! Well worth a visit.\"This is a very short trip off of Route 93. It is an easy walk, so kids shouldn't mind getting out of the car. It is another natural wonder in a beautiful environment.\"Picturesque stop with a small but pretty ferocious water fall. Great pics with the mountain in the background and enjoyed the various little paths to see different views and the river basin on the other side. Plus all the beautiful erosion of the rocks created by the water. Not overly crowded when I was on my tour but assume everyone will stop here on route through the Rockies.\"The Falls are right off the parking lot. The river has carved a sharp and fairly steep canyon. The hike to the lower falls may be even better, because you actually get a hike (really a walk) along the river to the lower falls just 3 KM down stream.\"\"Go early! It's a beautiful waterfall, just off the main highway, with a pretty good drop of water. The site has a large car park, and then you can walk around the falls and take in various views.There are lots of viewpoints and photo opportunities, and if you get the sunlight correct, you will get a beautiful rainbow shot over the falls. I suggest you go early or late....we went twice and its best when seen avoiding the crowds!\"\"What a beautiful waterfall! You see the first part of the waterfall. .....and then there is much much more to see! The river cuts through the rocks making many interesting canyons with swirling water and beautifully cut rocks! The walkway is quite level, athough if you are an older visitor, you would have to watch your step in a few places as the path is uneven. We have seen this waterfall in both beautiful weather and wet weather, but it is definitely worth seeing in ANY weather!\"Travelled from banff to jasper. The volume of water over the falls us amazing. Walked through a chute in the rocks that the river had made. Not to be missed\"Went there as part of a photography tour with Philip Norman Photography, Australia. This wonderful waterfall is very easily accessible and wheelchair friendly. It takes about 20minutes to walk around. Good place to take photographs. Aust go visit tourist attraction.\"This was one of our many stops in the Jasper National Park. We certainly weren't disappointed taking many photos. The weather wasn't great so the water didn't look as blue as the advertised photo shows.\"This is a great stop off along the Icefields Parkway. The falls are only a short stroll from the parking lot, and are an amazing sight. There are info points along the way, telling you about the history of the falls, and how they were formed. Plently of toilets available too!\"A stunning sight with water that has an intense blue that needs to be seen to be appreciated. We saw this on a tour with Brewster's from Lake Louise. Our guides marl & Lyndon were very helpful and assisted us to make the most of our experience.\"If the sun is out, then the light isn't so good for photos in the morning. Also, you might have to share your viewing experience with a number of coach parties on their way down the Icefields Parkway from Jasper.We were there at 10am in mid-September, and the sun was just getting up above the mountain; it was quite chilly!Well worth seeing, even so.\"Dramatic falls. Easy to view. Lovely shapes worn in to the rock by the most beautiful blue water. Loved it.This was a large falls with almost as much water as Niagara Falls. They had guardrails and nice paved paths to walk all around and see everything. Well worth your time to see this.\"I always love these falls absolutely beautiful, many many picture opportunities. They have done a wonderful job allowing for a lot of visitors, taking pictures plus keeping them safe. It is always amazing to me the amount of water that goes over the falls. When in Jasper this is a must to see.\"These falls are a unique blend of geology and water. The access is easy and safe as long as you stay on the path. If you don't you could die as did st least two young men whose memorials seem both sad and tragic.You have to visit them on the way through. Only a short walk from the car park. Beautiful against the mountain backdrop.You can not miss this stop... A short walk from the parking lot.. Pit toilets and picnic tables too.Absolutely stunning and spectacular. A thrilling experience and easy to walk around. Very memorable and could have spent much more time there...Get here early if the weather is good as the carpark is not too big and fills up early. Falls are just a short walk from the car park and you get great views from lots of different angles. Bring your camera.\"Wow! Tantalizing, Breathtaking and Gorgeous! A must see attraction! You will not be disappointed. Once you are done visiting the Banff Gondola, and Lake Louise, this is an attraction you cannot miss in Jasper.\"This is a fantastic stop for anyone in the area. I very short walk brings you to the falls. They are truly beautiful. There is a relatively short hiking trail that takes you along the gorge to the mouth of the river. I recommend the extra half hour for some nice photo oops. I was impressed with the raw power or the river and there were some interesting plaques with some historical information about the falls.\"A short walk to the falls which are very impressive, the blue colour of the lake with mountains in the backdrop was beautiful.\"\"but still interesting and beautiful... There's no way to avoid the crowds here (unless you go between 2000 and 0800) - certainly worth seeing, but there will be crowds...\"\"Unfortunately it was a visit with torrential rain, but even then a beautiful sight with the mountains in the background\"\"Wonderful location, fantastic scenery, although it was snowing when we visited. I would recommend visiting the falls.\"\"The last waterfall of the day, but great to see it channeling its way through a gorge, and see both above and below the fall\"\"I would recommend stopping to view these falls.we had our little 2 month old with us, so we brought a stroller. had to carry up and down a few stairs but mostly flat ground, easy to push stroller around.\"The Athabasca falls is a must; take the walk to the canyon down to the river. I was soo happy and impressed that we stopped at the falls twice. Once while going towards jasper national park and again while driving back at the Banff. Its an Absoulte must.I discovered that anything with Athabasca in the title is awesome!! The view of the falls with the mountains in the background is spectacular!Enjoyed these falls. Great photo opportunities. Spent couple of hours in the area. Would recommend Athebasca included on anyone's itinerary.This is a must see. Beautiful aqua marine water spilling over a deep gouge in the rocks. Many places to enjoy on their well done paths. We were even there in the rain but it didn't spoil anything. It's just off the Ice Fields highway so very convenient going or coming from Jasper. Best views are at the top viewing points.This is a mini Niagara Falls in a much better setting. And not as crowded either. Lots of different nooks and crannies to explore. Amazing! Do not miss it.Visited these falls as we were travelling from Banff to Jasper. They were stunning and well worth the stopWhat can I say but beautiful wonderful powerful sensational memorable and much much more ... it is a must see at least once in your life :)\"Had a walk around the Athabasca Falls and the scenery, like Jasper National Park, is simply stunning.\"This was an excellent short stop close to the road. It was fun to explore all the narrow gaps cut into the rock by the river. Very powerful falls and we'll worth the visit.For my wife and myself the best of the falls in the Jasper National Park. Beauty in the most beautiful of places. Stunning falls we could have stayed much longer moving water is so peaceful to watch. Most areas are easy for those with walking difficulties.We visited this falls after we left Jasper.it is a waterfall in Jasper national park on the Athabasca river.the water here falls with quite a force.Its amazing to see from the various viewing platforms around the water falls.there is a walking trail as well.The fall is not too far from the parking lot\"Nothing spectacular about the falls, kids loved the little canyon like area near the falls and had fun\"Athabasca Falls is just next to the car park. You can also see the river and pot holes as well. Quite impressive.This stop was definitely worthwhile. There is a bit of a walk to get to the falls but it was worth it.\"Quick short detour was well worth it. Spacious and beautiful in the sunshine, lots of photo opportunities.\"\"Nice place, free of charge, easy acces, nice view. Close to jasper and accisble to everyone. A place to see.\"\"Was here last in October 2015, but have stopped here many times and the sounds of the falls never gets old. It is about half an hour south of Jasper and good viewing from both sides of Hwy 93.\"\"Seeming this rampant rush of water just stirs the heart and soul. Walk all the routes, see all the views and take lots of photos for great memories.\"Pretty falls. The site is all paved and easy to navigate. The water is such a pretty blue. I suggest you take the short jaunt down to the river for a sideline adventure.\"Athabasca Falls is a beautiful sight not to be missed if you are in the area. The trail around the falls is stunning, as well as the steps down to the base where you can see the river. Do not miss this place!\"\"Athabasca Falls were beautiful. There were several viewing points along the very accessible trail. There were a few steps from the parking lot, so not sure if it was handicap accessible, but the falls are a short walk from the parking lot so there is no hike involved. With this accessibility also comes the crowds. Lots and lots of people trying to get pictures and such, so you will deal with a large amount of people, but definitely a place to stop and see. The power of the water is cool and there are several walking paths along the falls, canyon, and river. Nice place to spend 30 minutes to a couple of hours, depending on what you want to see.\"Stopped off at the falls during our coach trip from Banff to Jasper. A pleasant short walk from coach park to the falls which are properly safely protected by stout paths and railings. A nice roar from these for your videos !\"A must see. Awesome. If you like roaring water and large fabulous rocks you need to come stand, look, inhale, listen, and experience the power of nature that is Athabasca Falls. Have been here three times. Can't visit Canada without my fix of these falls. A must.\"I was in awe to watch the tons of waters soaring down crazy and so much fog was generated when the water hit the rocks. it sounds like thunder! You can feel the power of the nature!\"Free falls, takes a few minutes to walk down from the car park but it's a nice way to spend a few minutes and take a few pictures\"\"One might consider that anyone who has travelled to Philippines (the land of 7107 islands) with its hundreds of fairly easily accessible waterfalls might be 'jaded' by a non-tropical, Canadian waterfall.Not the case.Athabasca Falls is attractive in its own right with a fast flowing ice blue river and a gorgeous drop complemented by a beautiful gorge-like setting.The viewing areas are very good although the timber railings appear not to have had sufficient maintenance by Parks Canada or the other responsible government authority.The falls are only a 60 metre walk from the car park off the Icelands Parkway, so they are quite accessible.Even the disabled can easily view parts of the falls.\"Don't miss! Incredible falls right off the highway near Jasper. The trails around the falls are easy and the water is just incredible.\"We visited this place first thing in morning while on the way to Jasper from Calgary. Since we were early, found the parking spot easily and then it's a 15-20 mins short hike to the lower falls. The way is mostly paved and we were able to use umbrella stroller on most of the path. The best part is viewing the falls from the little cave - that's a very beautiful experience. When we reached near to the falls, there were 6-7 people ahead of us, standing in queue to enter the cave. And when we were returning, there were about 20-25 people in the queue. I would recommend going early or in evening to enjoy the place.\"Trails running up and down the falls give great views from different vantage points. Plan on spending some time there and enjoy.These falls are awesome and is well worth the little drive from Jasper. The falls are a short walk from the parking lot and there are various vantage points to view the them. Most powerful falls I've seen other than Niagara.\"Maybe because I went in a long weekend, we found this stop hyper busy, otherwise it's an absolute most stop on your way to Jasper!The path is basically everyone's friendly. Strollers, elderly, etc. As it's paved and there's a few lookouts from like almost every angle so you can admire the power of the water at this beautiful falls.There's interpretative posters everywhere were you can find fun and interesting facts about this place!\"\"Great visit. Easy walk around the facilities. Beautiful sceneryAbout 20-30 mins south of the Jasper town site\"\"Must visit place in jasper, nice for taking pictures. Definitely recommended. Try to go early to avoid crowds\"\"Right off the ice field highway, this is a good rest stop with something to see. The falls were raging in September. I can't imagine how they would look in late spring- early summer!\"\"Very nice and impressing.Few minutes walk from the parking lot and you get to the falls.Clean and nice.\"Lovely walkways all around so you can see the falls from all different angles. Tracks for walks. Lots of steps if you want to get to some areas. Free car park and loos. Good waterfalls.\"This requires a short visit as you travel down the Icefields parkway. Count on 30-45 minutes.The falls are spectacular, but even more interesting is the little footpath that leads through an old abandoned river channel to the bottom of the falls. Certainly a worthwhile stopping point.\"Best falls and viewing points in whole area. So incredible. Easy walking. Ok for wheel chairs also. Could easily spend an hour here.\"Stop by the falls if you're not pressed for time. I wasn't super impressed with them because I've been to Niagara falls and the ones in Hamilton, Ontario. The plus side is that it didn't take long to see and didn't involve much walking or hiking to check out. I would say this place is kind of overrated.\"\"This is a great area to walk around - the falls themselves are rather interesting. This is one of the stops on the icefields parkway that has bus parking, so count on a lot of people running about small pathways near the falls. There are pathways that lead away from the main falls and follow the river - this is where a bit of tranquility can be found, and quite recommended.\"\"As waterfalls go, these were great. There was an easy walk around the top of the falls, with plenty of viewing places.\"The falls are really close to the carpark and access is easy for old infirm and those who want to enjoy something that's very good.\"Gorgeous views and a short walk so very easy to get to and to take some wonderful pictures. Just like everything else here in the Canadian Rockies, you can't beat the beauty here.\"We drove down from Jasper to see these falls and it was well worth it. The falls are lovely and the rock formations around the falls show the incredible power of the water flowing over it.Very interesting and spectacular canyons on a decent walk through the valley. Downside crap maps for visitors.\"It's a super drive all the way, in fact it's beautiful anywhere and everywhere you drive around in Jasper.\"\"To be honest, this is the place I love most! whether you are looking for scenery or a short hike, Athabasca falls caters to all. Just standing by the fall, and feel the fresh water sprinkling on your face is sheer pleasure. We captured some very good pictures there. We walked around the short hike and it was a fun activity as a group.At the end, there is a stairs that leads to near the calm water collected at the bottom, and it is like a calm backwaters there. There are big rocks, so feels more rocky, but it is still beautiful. Everything about Athabasca is inviting, and as someone who has already visited 3 times, I must say, it leaves you craving for more everytime\"falls is few minutes walk from parking area with viewing decks that get crowded. spend few minutes walking down the river and be amazed by the carved rocks where the water used to flow.Stopped at the falls whilst driving the Icefields Parkway from Jasper to Lake Louise. There is a good sized carpark with facilities and it is then a short walk to the falls. It is free to see them and there are various viewing platforms and bridges etc to take photos from. If you are short of time do these falls and miss out Sunwapta Falls. Give yourself a min of 15mins but to soak up the experience 45/60mins would be better.Even on a cold miserable morning outside could not dim Majestic Beauty and Rush of adrenaline one takes away from this experience. Mother nature must have been working overtime. It would be great if you could time your visit to avoid a busload of tourists were obstructing your views. Even that still makes it well worth your visit and time to see such a beautiful waterfall.\"This is a pretty falls with paved sidewalks and interpretive signs. Not a hike and close to the road but its pretty, worth a stop.\"\"A perfect stop to get out and stretch your legs and enjoy the scenic beauty on the drive to Jasper. The waterfalls were forceful and a very easy walk from the parking lot. For those interested in seeing a bit more, there are stairs leading down to the calmer river front below.\"\"Nice place to stop and stretch your legs, have a little bit of a walk and explore the falls and gorge. Going all the way down the hill gives a calm back eddy and rocky beach where you can soak your feet in the icy water if the day is hot. Does tend to be quite busy with a lot of people stopping though, we had some trouble finding parking.\"\"You don't need more than about 15 minutes max to see the falls, but they're definitely worth a visit. Water. Falling. So long as you don't expect more, you won't be disappointed!\"\"The force of the water here is pretty impressive. At the time of our visit it was not over crowded. It is a good stop on your way between Jasper and Lake Louise. Our photos looked terrific. Blue sky, mountains in the back drop and some pretty impressive water falls.\"We visited athabasca falls on our trip to the Rockies. It was a cloudy rainy day so it was a good excursion from Jasper. We had done white water rafting the day before from the bottom of the falls do it was an opportunity to see what the driving force was behind the raft!Great free trip out for a couple of hours or so from jasper.This was a lovely place it was nice to see how the water had changed the rocks and there was no charge to see this mother nature at work\"Just a short walk, but was stunning. Views were lovely and the falls themselves were breathtaking. Well worth a stop for 20 minutes\"There are tons of waterfalls in the Canadian Rockies. Athabasca Falls is perhaps the most famous. It has paved walkways and lots of great viewpoints. It is fun and affords great photo ops.It is quite well worked with the ability to see the falls from both sides and a bit further down river. Nice place to break a journey and it has all the facilities.You can see a permanent rainbow form at the head of the waterfalls - the mist that is created because of the force of the water is truly amazing. Do carry something a little warmer as it can get chilly.\"This is an up-close view of a thunderous waterfall, a geological marvel. It is easy to find, there is a large parking lot,there are several viewing areas with sturdy railings, but there are steps to navigate to some areas.\"\"We called here on our first day in Jasper, its a beautiful walk where you get an insight into the history and different formations etc. The walkway gives you plenty of closeup photo opportunities and its spacious even when crowded!\"\"I agree with most of the other reviewers that this place is very beautiful, but can also get very busy. If you want to really enjoy it then you must get here early. It is a nice and easy trail so don't worry about that. Just enjoy your surroundings and take in the beauty of the falls.\"\"Definitely a must do, lovely walk with great photo opportunities the falls are beautiful with the greenest of waters.\"\"This place is definitely worth a spot, but as expected it was very busy when we were there on a long weekend. Gorgeous falls with good facilities and paths.\"These are stunning falls and well worth a visit. Take a walk around the various paths to see from all angles.The falls are beautiful. There are nice trails to walk. Would recommend a visit if you are in the area\"Natures raw energy on display. Nice foot paths lead you from one viewpoint to another.Getting there early doesn't mean you will beat the bus hordes\"Good tourist's attraction. I would recomend it if you have extra time or it is on your way to Jasper or Banff. Takes about 20-30 min to explore whole area.\"The Athabasca Falls are on the upper Athabasca River in Jasper National Park and worth a stop. The Falls were impressive. I gave the camera a workout and even took videos with sound. Viewed from just about any angle, they are interesting and mesmerizing.\"\"A really nice hike and beautiful to see.I would recommend highly to see it its very pretty. Good experience for family trip\"\"Beautiful Falls, Nice trails on either side of the Falls. Stairs that take you to the river/lake where we saw people tube boating.\"\"What an awesome view of fast running water. It cascades over the rocks, spraying cold glacier water up reminding you of how cold the water actually is. There are memorial benches reminding you of how unforgiving the falls can be. Not a place to miss on your travels.\"\"The falls are really nice, with quite a few viewing areas, so even when there are a lot of people there are many places to view the falls and the rocks that have been carved by the river. The various colours of the mosses add so much to the scenery as does the colour of the water as it rushes on its way. The falls are very close to the road, and well worth the visit\"This is amazing beyond words. We thoroughly enjoyed the short hike down and the beautiful falls. It is more than just looking at the falls and hiking up. There are so many beautiful areas.\"This was beautiful and a must see! The force of the water is hard todescribe. There are several viewpoints for this we did 1-4. Some incline but great trail.\"\"The roaring water, the long tumbles, the whirlpools creating sculptures in the rock, and the channels that you can walk where the water used to go all lend themselves to a chance to see the power of nature at work.Truly a great place to spend a bit of time, and be amazed at the amount of water that can move through in a matter of minutes.Great for all ages and abilities\"Keep that in mind as I rate this. It is great to watch the water flow to the fall and then turn into a roaring tumult as it heads down. Just avoid being distracted by the idiot tourists who want that wonderful picture in the most unsafe way over the barriers and on the rocks. They should get cameras with a zoom function.It's only a short walk to the fall from the parking lot. One of the wonders of nature shapes through times. We were lucky to see rainbows even. You can enjoy the fall from different view points with impressive feelings.\"first stop from the north entrance of jasper national park, the fall is not so big but we can look at it so close and from different angles, left and right, up and down, crowded stop\"\"It is a pretty waterfall, typical of the area. there are 2 viewpoints and both are easy walks. Not much more to say.\"Wonderful falls with thunderous sounds of water carving out the canyon below. Very good vantage points in which to view the action. You don't need to spend a long time here but it is special.\"Nice trail around the falls. Views fantastic. Not the best facilities though, but what do you expect in the Rockies.\"Falls were really great. Right off the highway so didn't require a hike to get to although you could hike further around than we did.It's easy to pull off the highway and take a quick look at these beautiful falls. The falls are located south of Jasper.Visited as part of a tour from Banff to Jasper. Nice un-spoilt falls so if you are passing do visit!\"What a roar and thunder these falls make... You cannot be other than impressed. Make sure to take the walk down the lower canyon and mind the sites remembering those who did not follow the instructions and slipped on the wet rocks...When driving in from Jasper take the 93A, when going to Jasper do the same, it is a beautifull peace of road.\"Great view and look outs.... Beautiful pathways to see upper and lower falls. Worth the stop for sure :)\"Worth a stop, nice viewing points and pathways. There were good information boards that explain the geology and vegetation. Nice place to stop bet even Jasper and the ice fields.\"\"A short walk from the parking lot, we could hear the roar and then see the spray around the water as we approached the falls. There is a sidewalk/platform on both sides of the falls, with wonderful views all around! We saw it on a cool sunny morning, with the sun streaking thru the evergreens and mountains in the background. The water is a foamy white going over the rocks exemplifying the utter force of the falls! It's a captivating site and well worth the short side trip from the highway to see!\"\"The good thing is that it is really easy to see these falls- it's right off the highway. The bad thing is that it's really easy to see these falls- so the parking lot fills up almost immediately. If you're going- plan to arrive early, or late. Don't recommend mid afternoon.\"\"Beautiful falls but not really aHiking area. More drop in and take pictures and leave. Worth the stop but don't expect to hike.\"The falls are beautiful. I highly recommend walking upstream or down stream to avoid some of the crowds yet still enjoy the falls.The place was packed when we went! So be prepared to wait a while for that perfect photo / selfie moment. The water rushes over a narrow canyon carving out the mountain - you can really feel the power of the water blasting through. There is a nice bridge over the falls.\"These Falls are a must to see!Not far off the main highway, washrooms, seating for relaxing , unreal positively majestic!\"\"This waterfall is really accessible, and requires no hiking. The site has well developed walkways and platforms for viewing the falls from different perspectives. A must see if you are in the area.\"This area is something you should not miss if you are driving from Jasper to Banff. Just pull off at the sign and walk a short (less than 5 minutes) from the parking area to see the beauty of the Athabasca Falls.\"Loved going to the falls. Make sure you have your camera, there is something about water falls that a person must capture!\"\"This is a awesome sight that you must see. The trails to get around the falls are well designed and easy to get around. Great place to get some great photos. There was a many warnings for safety reasons. Apparently every year a life is lost here due to people not following the rules. We saw a little memorial there for someone who had lost his life. Pretty sad to see a young Asian lady climb over the fence to have her picture taken. Later I saw her getting into her car and I was embarrassed she was from my home Province MANITOBA. She totally disrespected the warnings and the memorial for the person who lost their life there. I don't understand why some people feel they don't have to follow the rules. It's behaviour like that that can end up in tragedy and ruin it for the others . One wrong move or slip on those rocks and you would be ground meat. The power of that water needs to be respected . Note to others , when visiting anywhere respect the rules that are in place.\"\"I like Maligne Canyon more than Athabasca Falls. To see the canyon, we need to walk some distance, while the Athabasca Falls are almost right in front of you after you leave the parking lot. There were some people water rafting which looked like fun. If it is a sunny day, you should book it ahead in town.\"\"Well worth a visit - these falls were not the biggest we saw on our Canada trip but they are accessible and the water eroded rock is easy to see. It is also well worth walking down to the bottom of the falls, through an old river bed - so you really see the effects of water erosion.The down side was that, since the access is good there were lots of people - don't expect exclusivity.\"\"Breathtaking views of the falls and amazing canyon structures too. We visited Maligne Canyon and viewed the first 4 view points as we were short on time. Maligne is beautiful too but if you have time to just do either, I would suggest these falls as they offer both the water and canyon views and it is very close to the highway.\"I thought it was a small area to watch a small fall but it is so much more than that. Once you visit and go a few steps down you really enjoy the beauty of the falls along with the canyon like formation around the area. Go all the way down to the edge of the water and enjoy another view (looking up). Some parts are very slipper and very narrow so make sure you have shoes with grip.\"We stopped with the kids on the Icefield parkway to the Athabasca Falls and this is one of our favourite stops !Secure area with kids, short walk to stunning sceneries! Don't forget to charge your camera or phone to take amazing pictures!\"\"We visited Athabasca Falls as the last stop-off on our journey along the Icefields Parkway from Lake Louise to Jasper in August.Recent rain and snowfall had maximised the volume of water flowing into the falls, and on our visit they were spectacular. The violence of the water pouring through the small falls gap was a sight to behold. There are lots of good viewing points on both sides of the falls, so that you can see them from all angles.Very highly recommended. A must if you drive the Parkway.\"We stopped at the Falls on our way into Jasper. It's easy to access from the highway and beautiful views everywhere.these falls attracted many visitors - so try and go early to avoid the rush. Very picturesque with plenty photographic oportunities.We loved spending time at these falls - the rushing water really makes you realise how powerful the falls actually are. Great photo opportunities too!Walked along the entire track from top to bottom and had a great time Great view great falls a very interesting place to visit. Nice afternoon or morning walk as the sun is hot during the mid day when trail opens out.\"A short walk, and nothing strenuous. Some nice areas to walk around and see the falls. Definitely worth the stop!\"Impressive natural waterflow with great vantage points. Nice to get to the river at the bottom of the falls.Just a short stop but worth it to see the volume of water. Not the most dramatic but close to it. Restrooms available and plenty of parking space on the day we were there.Be prepared to be wowed by the fantastic Athabasca Falls. Mother Nature in all her glory will surely leave you feeling amazed.\"A short drive south of Jasper and easy hike along the trail gives a great view of the roaring Athabasca Falls. I am impressed with how the Canadian parks insure quality trails and sturdy bridges on their trails and walkways. Here you see several vantage points for viewing and photos. The falls are impressive for their wide powerful rush of water over the rocks, not sheer height. Definitely worth a stop on the Icefields Parkway drive south of Jasper.\"\"It is a beautiful set of falls, all on a paved path. Very short, I had expected a lot more of a walk. Falls are right off the parking lot, walking down to river is also very short walk. Cool to see! Disappointed with length of activity\"\"There is something about these falls. I loved them. Its a short walk from the parking lot.The picture water, its force, color and sound will remain with you for ever\"This is popular especially if buses are there. Don't despair. Give it 15 minutes and the waterfall views clear out. There are several areas to visit while at the falls. Take them all in. You can easily spend under an hour and see everything. Viewing the other areas at the falls will also be quieter. Most people cluster at the falls viewpoint and don't explore the other areas. The waterfall force is extremely strong. You are very close to the falls. Do not cross the railings and keep an eye on your children.\"This waterfall is on the road from Banff to Jasper. It is definitely worth pulling off the road for. There are several overlooks. Make sure to walk around the area and look for the best camera shots. There are usually lots of people here, because it is an outstanding place. Just be patient and you can work your way up to a great picture-taking spot.\"The falls are beautiful with interesting Rock formation. The car park is 10 min walk from viewing platforms. There is a good network of viewing platforms linked by bridges allowing you to see different aspects of the waterfall and walk to the river floor. We spent about 40 mins there.\"Been here a couple times over the years, and honestly even on the rainiest of days it is astonishingly beautiful. Don't miss your chance to walk around this area!!\"This water fall is not far from the town of Jasper. The waterfall is amazing and the canyon that the water flows through once its gone over the falls is a masterful piece of are created by nature. It is a must see while in Jasper.A short detour off the highway lead us to this beautiful spot with some walking trails if you wanted to spend more time. Great photo opportunity\"The falls a worth a visit we we re driving past and went in , glad we did not miss the falls. The way the water has eroded the surrounding rocks is awesome\"We spent about an hour at the falls enjoying the warm weather.awe The mighty Athabasca never fails to impress as it tumbles over the falls. Plenty of opportunities for good pictures and a nice place to stretch your legs.\"part of a package with trafalgar tour. amazing sight and sound, block out time to enjoy, explore and visit the bridges over the falls. we were very rushed on the tour. would have liked to have been able to \"\"soak it in\"\" a bit longer.\"\"We just visited the Athabasca Falls recently and this is a beautiful site to see. Make sure and walk around the whole thing! Its is so pretty to see the canyon. Love it here, it is so peaceful.\"We took a little family trip to Jasper and went to Athabasca Falls. So very beautiful and definitely worth going to see\"These falls are much hyped in the area but though quite interesting are not terribly dramatic, so don't expect Niagara. Pleasant walk suitable for less mobile visitors.\"Pretty interesting and dramatic falls for something that's very easily accessible. Definitely recommend stopping here for a few minutes if you're going by. It's worth a trip there even if you're not.Lovely view point of the falls and has good parking area and also washrooms. There was a lot of people while we were there\"The falls are breathtaking. Located about 30 minutes from Jasper. The main outhouses were gross, but if you go to the end of the parking lot there are another set that were cleaner. I am surprised no tourists fell to their deaths here in front of us, as some people were in the out of bounds areas to get their picture taken. Yikes!\"Be sure to stop here. Just beautiful location and very interesting and easy walk to and around the falls.Awesome. Loved it completely. There is a nice easy walk around the falls. Highly recommended if you are in Jasper area my 3rd favorite destination in Jasper national park. First being Mount Edith Cavel hike and second Malign Hike.\"Just beautiful. And the rock formationsare gorgeous. Just amazing what Mother Nature creates. Definitely worth stopping& seeing this. It's only about 30 minutesor so outside of Jasper in the way to Banff\"\"We have now visited the falls in all four season, Will they were super strong with the spring melt, frozen in winter and now most recently in summer. They were awesome to see every time. The walk to the falls from the parking lot is quick and easy, even with a stroller. Make sure you go to all the different viewpoints and walk the trail all the way to the end as there are a great variety of different ways of looking at the falls and Canyon. Totally worth a stop as you travel through Jasper Park.\"While in Jasper it's a must to make a visit to Athabasca Falls. It's free to check out and you can spend a good half hour to check it all out. The views and photos are amazing and definitely worth to observe and soak in. It can get a bit busy so the off season might be better.Arrived super early on journey from Jasper to Banff only 2 other cars in the car park. Weather was dull and although falls were good to see others we have seen (Mistaya and Johnston Canyon were better). We're only there 5-10 mins. Falls are quick easy walk from the car park.Great stop on the way to or from Jasper. It takes about a half hour to see all aspects of the falls. Well worth the time. There are information areas along the path that tell you about the falls and the flora and fauna.\"If you're travelling through, you simply must stop at Athabasca Falls. Stunningly beautiful. Lots of parking available, plus a few short trails to walk.\"\"During warm or hot weather days, the trails and photo spots can be very busy. Try to travel earlier in the day. Best time I have found to travel here is late April, early May or the Fall before the snow falls.\"\"These falls will always hold a magical place in my heart. Between the thrill of danger looking at the rocks above the falls and imagining what it would be like to travel the rushing water along the canyon, this place has a quiet energy that will rejuvenate you.\"\"close to the highway, great potholes and massive amount of water. Not a long walk but very good views. Take time and check this out.\"\"We stopped to look at the falls and went for a nice walk all the way to the bottom. Very beautiful, but busy spot.\"\"My wife and I enjoyed our stop at Athabasca Falls. It was fairly busy but not overwhelming. We took time to enjoy the views, take some pictures and read the several plaques describing the falls, river, rapids and some of the history surrounding the site.\"As with a lot of the spots on the Icefield parkway the downside is the limited area for parking versus the number of tourists stopping. Allow about 30 minutes to explore the area where the raging waters has worn away the rock over the centuries.30 km from Jasper is Athabasca Falls. It is right off the Ice Field Parkway ( Canada 93). This is the most voluminous falls in the park and the 80 foot tumble into a narrow canyon is a must see. The park has done a great job providing you safe access for optimal viewing. So enjoy and don't forget your camera.\"What a beautiful experience! Great stop along Highway 93! Great opportunity for pictures, with many different places to stand.\"It is not far off the road and you can walk to it. The water that rushed down from the glacier area was absolutely breath taking. Don't miss itWe stopped off at the falls on our way from Banff to Jasper. Very impressive and well worth a look. Take a trip down the river aswell if you get chance. Great fun for all.\"To see power of nature, please see Athabasca fall. Myself and my family enjoyed the fall very much. I strongly recommend to visit this fall\"\"This is an impressive site. The torrent of water rushing thru is amazing and the overall viewing is impressive. It is a must see, don't pass it by!\"\"A must see stop in the mountains! Such a beautiful wonder - a little touristy, just because it's a beautiful spot so there was a ton of people when we went, but still a must stop.\"\"Stopped here on our way to Saskatchewan crossing. I loved the informative plaques, teaching about the waterfall and erosion. The paths are well kept and easy to navigate. My only complaint is against the people that choose to vandalise such an amazing natural wonder.\"\"Visited on a trip From Jasper to Banff, just a short detour required. A short walk to the various viewing areas both sides of the falls on good paths.The water has cut a path through the rock making a huge whirlpool as it goes, very impressive. The river above is also picturesque.\"\"One of the highlights of the Icefield Parkway.Excellent viewing points of the fallsSufficient parking space.A must do.\"\"The falls are the nicest that I have seen in the Rockies. What is especially nice is that there are several viewing areas and a short walking trail, so it is possible to get some reprieve from all those taking selfies\"Absolutely gorgeous views of the falls. Loved all the levels you can walk to amd enjoy other parts of these beautiful falls.I had very high expectations due to the reviews but still wasn't disappointed. These are small falls but very violent. Loved seeing the power of water/nature. Liked to hike around the area and by hike I mean walk. This is in no way a tough/steep hike.. just easy walk over small bridges/steps. Beautiful views if you go further down.The falls were amazing but very crowed with other tourists. Took some lovely photos as the sun was shining forming rainbows. Suggest visiting in the week.Athabasca Falls is Stunning! Bring your camera. It's an easy walk from the top to the bottom and there are gorgeous views of the river and mountains. Spend an hour or two on your way through Jasper National Park.\"Organized for tourists, close to the road, easy access. Go early: it gets crowded mid day making the visit less enjoyable. Parts of the trail can be a bit tight and awkward. It's probably quite nice late as well, with the sunset lighting up the mountains. It rained intermittently when we were there. Didn't bother us. Always carry rain gear when in western Canada and wear non-slip hiking shoes or boots.\"\"The Athabasca river is VERY high, so this waterfall is POWERFUL. You can hear it and feel it. They have built walkways in the right place, so you can see all the different parts quite well.\"\"Easy walk from the parking lot gets to the falls, great vantage points on both sides of the falls. Make sure you take the hike under the second path under the bridge, It was a nice surprise, basically a walking trail where the water used to run through.\"Took our out of town family to see the falls and they loved it! Weather was great...not too crowded and got lots of great pics!We enjoyed seeing the falls from all angles and took lots of photos. Was perfect to see on our way to Jasper\"Pretty easy walk, great photo opportunity. Go all the way around the walk path to the far end. You get a great view of the falls.\"A circular trail from the parking lot leads to spectacular views of the several falls that comprise this site. Allow one to two hours and bring a camera that can take video. Worth the visit.\"Standing and feeling the spray of the water from the powerful Athabasca Falls, is breathtaking. Where does the water get such energy? The falls are beautiful and awe inspiring. There are steps down to the river which are easy to walk and climb. It is a beautiful part of nature.\"The falls are very conveniently located right beside the highway and are within a very short walk from the free car park. The falls are interesting and the view points offer some great places to take photographs.\"Very beautiful, liked the posts with the information about the falls. Some spots are tight to walk through\"\"We had seen the falls from far away when we were headed rafting. So we were hesitant to stop on the way south from Jasper to LL. But we were traveling using a driving tour ap (Gypsy Guide - highly recommend) and the guy talked so great about it, that we decided to stop.Truly, it was very impressive. And it's great because you can spend as much or as little time here as you want. Just park and walk over or hang out longer.The falls are impressive not due to their height, but the sheer power of so much water being forced down the falls with rocky twists and turns (not a straight line water fall).The only reason for 4 vs 5 stars is I usually rank activities where I spend some time checking places out a 5 and here we went in, took some pics and left. But it's 100% worth the stop.\"\"Impressing waterfall close to the car parking, 10-15 minutes for relax and watch the water stream. In my top 10 list\"\"This is a very nice falls, but it is just down a path from the parking lot, so everybody can see the falls...so everybody does....crowded.Still, it is worth a stop. The falls is wide, the water drops about 40 feet, and there are a couple of side falls which are narrower and higher velocity. The water drops into a narrower channel, so it churns and hisses as it fights its way through the rocks, and finally back to a wider lake.You can cross a bride to the other side, so photo ops abound...worth a look\"We stopped on our way to Jasper from the Columbia Icefields. A very impressive natural sight with good vantage points even though it was very busy.\"We stopped here as it was the number 1 rated activity in the park, but I can only conclude that 99% of people don't want to go more than 30m from their cars to get a view. This is nothing compared to the waterfalls along the Berg Lake trail.\"Fantastic views. Great waterfalls. You can take excellent photographs. Highly recommended. Easily accessible. Plenty of viewing points. Taken many photographs published with this view.Not A far walk not far off the highway worth the time and effort to go and see it it's beautiful . Picnic places and restrooms and lots of hiking and beautiful sceneryThese falls are amazing. The force of the water is powerful and majestic. The gorge is beautiful. Don't miss this if you're in the Canadian Rockies.\"So many vantage points - I took way to many photos from each and every direction possible. It's very popular with bus tours and individuals alike. There are bathroom facilities there and signage about the area and falls. Give yourself at least 30minutes to take it in, only a short walk from the car park.\"\"Great quick stop along the highway. Lots of spots for photographers to take pictures, and a nice path down to the water.\"The water never stops flowing. The rock shapes it creates are wondrous. This is a great place to walk and to look at how water affects geology.\"Went to see the falls. Nice and good place for taking memory pictures of the falls. Easy to reach. The only bad thing there is the washrooms, disgusting and very bad smell.\"Powerful waterway. Very good viewpoints for many photos from many angles. Nice stop along the Icefields Parkway.We saw Moose here! It does get crowded with buses as it is a popular place. That is to be expected with most sites in the area. Plan your visit accordingly.Beautiful view. Athabasca falls is a wonderful spot to stop and take a breath. Lovely spot to relax and connect to the outdoors.\"Go, it will take your breath away, and you just may experience oneness with the universe. Be prepared!\"We stopped and spent quite a bit of time here on our way from Banff to Jasper. Just beautiful to take it all in. Highly recommend.We stopped by the falls on our way between Jasper and Banff and enjoyed the stop. The river is fed by the Athabasca glacier which is an extension from the Columbia Ice Field... the power of the river is great to see... definitely worth the stop.This was a quick stop with much beauty. The guide helped us with some history and made sure we saw the falls from several angles\"It was quite crowded and it was raining when I visited so it was hard to find a good view of the fall (if there is one). But even just at a glimpse, it was really cool seeing how powerful this waterfall is and it was quite fascinating.\"\"We stopped by Athabasca Falls and hiked down to Bridge 4, and then drove to Bridge 6. As other reviewers noted, the most interesting slot and rock formations are in the first several bridges. It is always amazing/pretty to see what nature's force can do with water and rock, and that is very true at Athabasca Falls. This was very similar to Marble Canyon, which we also enjoyed. There were alot of people at Athabasca Falls, but not too many that we couldn't enjoy the views.\"\"Being around the falls area is an experience of the power and wonder of nature. The roar of the the rushing water, cutting it's way through rock faces, creating whirl pool pots is amazing and dynamic. Nice hiking paths in and around falls.area.Well worth the stop. Very close to the highway!\"\"We visited Athabasca Falls early in the morning, before the crowds ascended on it. It was a very nice walk, with interesting signage telling about the falls\"You get to see a lot more majestic vistas if you are willing to walk along a few hiking trails in the area. The waterfall is fine. Worth stopping for 5 min if you happen to cross the general area.\"very nice but go early in the morning , make sure your camera is charged and take the walk around the falls\"\"thoroughly enjoyed the views of the falls, quite busy so have to be patient to get the good shots. Actually returned the following day at a different time. Also walked around to another part of the falls which was a nice quiet walk.\"\"Beautiful Area to visit and falls are easy to get to, just a short 5-10 minute walk. The tip I have for everyone is to arrive early before the crowds get there. You can see Athabasca Falls and surrounding area in one hour.\"Got here at 0800 on a beautiful sunny morning and shared the magical place with one other couple. Spent about an hour walking both sides of the ravine and marvelling at the post glacial power of the river and the wonders it has and continues to create. A real privalage to ba able to spend time here.Great stop along the way. Lots to see and no cost for admission. Walk from top to bottom in 15 minutes or so. Kids thought it was pretty cool too.\"The falls aren't very big, but there are violent. Quite a spectacle and worth stopping for.The trip down to the falls is pretty short, and although it can be uneven and rocky, we managed it with a stroller.\"\"This is right off the road, and requires only easy walking to view. Nice spot, but like anywhere else obey the signs and don't end up in the water. Don't need more than 20 minutes to see it all.\"This must see waterfall is easily accessible and very close to parking lot. You can see it off of highway 93. We stop every year!A good example of what Nature can do... It will surprise anyone with interest on geography and how nature impacts the soil... Not to be missed as the water effect on rocks is to be noticed...\"Must see if only trip to area. Quite busy as just off main highway, coach stop. Allow 1/2 hr-45 min for walk-around. Not strenuous at all. No cafe/restaurant at site. Combine with Mt. Edith Cavell hike further up same road- (more strenuous)\"\"Great spectacle! Plenty of parking. Short easy walk to falls. Plenty of view points on each side from which to take photos from. Spent well over an hour wandering through this site.A must see if in the area!\"\"The falls are not a huge spectacular drop but are very pretty. The water is rushing so fast and has created a channel through the rocks. You can get several views of the falls by following the trail and viewing platforms. You can see the fall from the front, side, and back. There are signs warning not to get off the trail. If you should get out on the rocks and fall, you would most likely not survive because of the speed and cold of the water.This part of the Athabasca is actually considered a Class 6 - nobody has run it. The water is too fast, the openings too narrow.It is an easy walk from the parking lot to the view of the falls. Very nice.\"An astounding place with awesome views. Thoroughly would recommend visiting here. Camera is a necessity to capture the amazing scenery.\"These falls are nice, but Maligne Canyon is considerably more beautiful and natural. This is OK if you've got kids and need a short quick trip.\"Another beautiful stop! Easy walk on well maintained trails. Lots of signs warning you not to go over the fences but we saw people doing it anyway - foolish. Great photo opportunities. We went later in the day and it was still busy.What a wonderful spot to take pictures. You can hike down about yards from parking to the falls. The energy of the water is breath taking. Don't miss itThis was a beautiful stop along the Icefields Parkway. There is a path with various lookouts and signs describing aspects of the falls. The speed and force of the water flowing over the falls was amazing.Athabasca Falls should be a definite stop when visiting Jasper National Park! It is an easy walk to the falls from the parking lot and there are numerous viewpoints from which to see the falls. The power and abundance of water it amazing!\"Lovely, powerful waterfall. A busy tourist destination in the summer but well worth a visit if you can find a parking spot.\"very beautiful canyon. water colors are amazing . take the time to enjoy the view and the river trail.There is a beautiful hiking to see the Athabasca Falls! The water is super blue and clean and super cold too hahah. I touched the water just to feel it and even in the summer it was cold..\"We planned a early morning driving loop from Jasper down Hwy 93 to Hwy 93a first stop Athabasca Falls approx 30 minute easy drive.These falls get very, very crowded (so does all the main sights around Jasper). We beat most of the crowds and enjoy the powerful water flow, falls and the carved out canyon and the stunning scenery.There is excellent paths and signs here that navigate you above the canyon and if you have the time to the end of the canyon.Worth the visit but get in early.\"Plenty of good viewing spots for these powerful falls not far out of jasper. Went there after seeing the glacier that feeds them.I've never been this close to Falls moving at a massive speed as this and with such force. To see the falls in the canyon that it had carved out is quite spectacular. If you're in the area don't miss this.Gorge-ous! Enjoy this stop to see the power of water. Great locations to see the falls and the gorge from a variety of angles.Definitely worth a stop on Hwy 93 for some 'refreshing' views! Was pretty busy when we visited so prepare to share the viewpoints\"Our family enjoyed the falls - good parking, easy access, and description plates that were interesting. The area is beautiful!\"\"This was easy to find, the parking was crowded, but it is popular. Lots of photo opportunities and truly incredible scenery\"Spectacular waterfalls in Jasper. Good parking. You are able to walk around falls to take photographs and walk down area below. Gets really busy so best to go early or later in day. We went at 8:30pm and it was so quiet. The lighting also enhanced the photos we took.\"Athabasca Falls is definitely worth a stop. There are many lookouts to view the raging flow of the Athabasca River carve its way over the rocks. Not only are the falls quite spectacular, so are the rocks that have been sculpted by the force of the water.\"This set of falls will really give you a feel for the power of water. The paths surrounding the falls are quite extensive getting you very close to the water and providing lots of different views. Free to see.A bit busy during the busy season but that's how the whole area is in July.Beautiful iconic spot in the Rockies. Always busy but it's because of the outstanding waterfall. Parking can be tricky when busy.We charged around this attraction after a day on the icefields. We wanted to see where the melt water went.The falls itself is a massive fury of white water that is terrifyingly beautiful. We rushed around it because of a timing issue but it was an awesome sight that warranted more time.The falls are a must see on your trip from Jasper to Banff. Its a short easy walk. It was more spectacular than we expected.\"Very nice, the canyon is a wow, nice boardwalk makes viewing safe and easy, The morning sunlight was difficult for photos, I would recommend visiting later in the day for best effect..\"Stopped here on our way to Jasper. Have been here many times and I am always impressed by Nature. Truly beautiful and breathtaking to see. A short stop will provide you with great pictures and a true appreciation of the great outdoors. Take some time and make this a stop on your way to Jasper or on the way home.\"We stopped here for a stretch. It was a nice walk with awe inspiring views. Beautiful location but a very busy stop too, so expect lots of people!\"We stopped here briefly while driving from Jasper to Moraine Lake. The falls are spectacular and well worth the stop. Hard to describe their power. You could stay longer and do the longer walks but sadly we were pressed for time. Well worth a visit and free of charge.\"The falls get very busy but they are worth going to visit, the path the water has cut into the rock is amazing, like all parks in Canada it is well maintained and easy to access and good parking.\"We visited a number of falls in the Rockies and this was by far the most spectacular and the most interesting. Not difficult to access.\"These Falls were not on our schedule, rather we came across them on our drive from Lake Louise to Jasper. So glad we made a quick detour as they are wonderful to see! There is a delightful trail that guides you around this beautiful natural wonder when you can marvel at the shapes & canyon drops in the rock face. There is a car park nearby and you can spend as much time as you like on the trail. Highly recommended..\"These falls are absolutely magnificent! The immense power coming from the falls is spellbinding. A tru must see!Go to Athabasca Falls...even if you only spend 20 minutes! You will understand the power of Mother Nature and water. It is awe inspiring!What is striking about the Athabasca Falls is really how close you can get to it. It's and easy walk from the parking lot. Half hour to 45 mins is a good time to see the whole of the falls.\"What an amazing view! The power of water is incredible! After walking around the falls and checking out part of the trail, we were amazed. So glad that all the safety measures are in place for people to stay safe around these powerful falls. Rock climbing around water is so dangerous!\"Great views. Very accessible. Multiple view angles on beautiful falls and river. We enjoyed it very much. Close to the I93 but rake the rural road one way - is also niceWe had a quick stop here on our 2 night stay in Jasper. Was very happy that the falls were so close to the parking lot and we didn't have to walk very far. Stunning views and colours of the water.\"wonderful views and worth seeing. But, enjoyed the Maligne Canyon walked a bit better: fewer people and saw more wildlife there as well.\"\"Very nice falls, lot of viewing area, lot of informations, parking could be issue in afternoon. Canyon is nice too.\"\"Another one of the 'must see' natural wonders of the area, so be prepared for tour buses and lots of tourists taking selfies. Take your time so you can go to a less busy part of the area until the tour bus crowd moves on - they usually have a set amount of time so take a bunch of photos then keep moving. Follow the paths down to the river at the bottom and around to the far side of the falls where you'll often see a rainbow form in the spray. It's a beautiful area and you can see how the water has carved different routes through the rock over time. Signs explain how the area has changed over the years and there are plenty of viewpoints for stunning scenery.\"\"Can get very busy, so finding a parking place can be difficult, but well worth it. Falls are spectacular and can get some great photos.\"A very impressive piece of work by nature where a creek cannons through a narrow gap and splashes out. Plenty of spots for great photos.\"We visited many, many waterfalls when we toured the Rockies and I have to say this is one of the best, if not the best. It was certainly the most powerful waterfall we saw by a long shot. It's an excellent short stop on the Icefields Parkway. It won't take long, 30 mins to an hour tops. If you are looking for a more immersive experience, Maligne Canyon provides more variety than Athabasca Falls. You might want to wear a jacket when you visit here as you will likely get sprayed with mist. My camera got a bit wet trying to get some of the more close up photos. That being said, make sure to get there early. We arrived at around 8am and it was nice and quiet, by the time we left at 8:45am or so, the coaches started arriving and we scampered. The same can be said for most attractions on the parkway, you want to be setting off really early!\"Good information on boards as you walk round and plenty of vidwing places. Great photo opportunitiesThe force of these waterfalls was downright gobsmacking. My mouth was on the floor. This is definitely something to see - a waterfall fed by purely glacier water with a seemingly never ending stream of water. There was also a rainbow.. so gorgeous!\"Impressice Waterfall close to Jasper. Lots of people, of course, but also lots of parking. No entrance fee.\"Just off Rte 93 about 20 minutes south of Jasper. Take a 45 minute stop when passing Athabasca Falls. The power and beauty of these falls is worth taking some time out from your travels. I actually drove down from Jasper just to see the falls. Great pictures as the water drops to canyon floor below.\"Beautiful, but we chose to forego the throngs of tour buses and crowds for less crowded sights. Disappointed. Parks have added different advantage points in order to view the falls, which is helpful.\"Love visiting these falls. Go each year as we camp at Wabasso. There are many viewpoints to take pictures from. Fun to go all the way down to see the rafters take off. Amazing to see nature at work\"Just a great place , close to nature. Well worth a stop here. Close to the main road. Nice for picnic stop. Stone beach area beyond the falls fun for kiddies to explore. Lots of info about the Falls for the readers among us. Good half day trip.\"Well worth a visit although the area gets crowded and you need to be patient with the crowds from the coach tours who take photos from every angle. Definitely the most impressive falls in the area.\"Very impressive falls with easy access and plenty of parking, well worth a visit, an easy drive from Jasper. Great photos opportunities.\"\"It is a very powerful experience to see the force of nature. There are several trails to take to get different views of the falls. It is very easy walking, making it accessible to people of all ages.\"\"Lovely place to stop by. It was busy, but the scenery was worth it. Look for the rainbow, as the sun comes through. We enjoyed the beauty. People are crazy,though, and go behind barriers. Don't do that!\"Enjoyed the sites but a bit busy when we were there. Ample parking and toilets available. very prettyVery brief hike to see some amazing falls. It was busy but seemed set up well to handle the people. Easy & quick to check it out if you're driving by.\"Worth a visit just to see the power of a river squeezed through a narrow gap.As our North American friends are prone to saying, \"\"awesome.\"\"There's no admission fee, a free car park ( which can get crowded) and toilets.So there's absolutely no reason not to visit this fabulous natural spectacle.\"\"It is a wonderful waterfall, but unfortunately the park had to build too many concrete walkways and bridges around it to handle all the people\"\"This is so easy to get to that it should be on everyone's itinerary.One of the best falls in either National Parks\"\"This is one of those places for your bucket list. Truly awesome, nature at its most spectacular. A gorge with fast flowing icy water that ends in a turquoise pool, and the noise is amazing. Slippery ice under foot !\"The falls are beautiful and worth a look but there's not much room from which you can get a good view and when we went - a Thursday afternoon in August - it was very busy so I'd suggest this as a brief stop off rather than a day-trip destination.We were lucky enough to stop her on our tour amazing water falls just to stop and listen to water coming down crystal clear amazing .Not breathtaking but beautiful. Super crowded. Fun to walk along the various trails. Good parking. Filthy dirty nasty bathrooms. Easily accessible by RV. Quite popular stop.\"Don't miss these falls. The sheer volume of water in the summer makes this what the word \"\"awesome\"\" was invented for. Easy walk even for the less mobile. Very accessible and safe for kids to see (safely fenced off\"\". 30mins and you are done. But worth the detour.\"\"As a traveller.who have been to Niagara fall many times, I did not expect another fall could draw my attention. However Athabasca fall definitely worth your time. The view is spectacular and you can actually see the fall from multiple angles which is a huge plus. Highly recommended.\"\"I saw that this was the #1 rated thing to do in the park, but we went to Maligne Canyon the day before and I couldn't imagine how anything could be better than that. But this was! A man was there with a wooden flute and played some music for us. Such a delightful time! The walking is not too strenuous, either.\"\"We were so close to the raging two-pronged Athabasca Falls that the sound was thunderous. All along the walkways, we saw and felt the force of the water as it plunged and squeezed into a narrowing cavernous pit and then into a lake that soon became rapids. Niagara Falls may not have another rival in Canada, but Athabasca Falls could be its awesome little sister.\"\"Athabasca Falls was my favorite falls in Banff or Jasper 40 years ago and still is. Don't miss it for sure!If you like falls, don't miss Marble Canyon just on the other side of the Continental Divide in Kootenay Natl Park.\"\"Not a long walk, but lots of information along the way. Wonderful views of the canyons and falls. Make sure to go early or late, it does get crowded with bus loads of tourists.\"Beautiful place to visit. Absolutely stunning views and a nice walk around the site. Lots of parking as well.Biggest falls seen in the area. Plan to arrive before 10 am before parking lot is full or after 4 pm when cars leave. Keep camera close to avoid water spray.\"Like always, God's creation is amazing. Self guided tour allows you to do what you want. It can be easy or hard if you want.\"We stopped here while heading to the columbia ice fields - nice little stop in the day! the falls are great and the foot paths are well maintained.\"These stunning falls are right next to the road so of course they're crowded with people most of the time during the summer. Worth the trip, yes, though I would encourage those who can to venture a bit farther than just the area around the car park.\"\"Very touristic place, there are other falls to visit. The Athabasca Falls are worth a visit though, they're beautiful and large.\"The water is very clear and the scenery is simply stunning. Go early in the morning to avoid the big tour buses.Mixture of power and beauty. This is a must visit to see crashing waves and stunning beach front at the bottom. Really good to match it with Mount Edith Cavell.\"Nice visit, just around the corner from the road. When you are in the parc, do not miss it! You will be rewarded with spectacular views.\"So glad we stopped here. The falls were amazing. There were bridges and walking paths all around the area and a walkway down to the bottom. Down below was s perfect place to take your shoes off and wade in the river. I paid to go on the Skywalk and this was free and so much betterThis place gets crowded but it is a must stop along the road. Easy paved walk to roaring waterfalls.Only just off the main route through Jasper National Park. Good views of the falls and interesting information boards at points along the gorge. We went across to the rapids on the other side of the road and were entertained watching people set of for the white water rafting. Well worth a visit but try and get there early in the day.Beautiful stop! Spectacular scenery! It was so beautiful and breathtaking. The walking paths to the falls were very convenient and safe. Don't miss this stop!\"Athabasca Falls is not a quick stop. Plan on at least 30 minutes to wander the trails and take pictures from various locations. It is a lovely stop, and much less crowded than further South around Lake Louise. Stay on the path and behind the fence. Memorials to those who did not can be found near the falls.\"\"The falls is beautiful and and an easy walk for both young and old. Excellent paved & wooden trails allow you to walk all around the falls and see it at many angles. We went when it was lightly raining which did not distract from the beauty. The falls at the top is powerful and you'll get covered with the spray, it continues on down the mountain with tunnels of swirling water. If you go at high season get there early or late to really soak it in. A 'must see' in the Rockies!\"\"Magnificent scenery and well worth the stop off the Columbia Icefields Parkway. They are not huge falls, but they are beautiful. We were advised to go either early or late in the day to avoid the masses of people and we did go prior to 11am, so the crowds weren't too bad yet. The parking was not yet full at this time.\"\"Easy walk, paved, with great views of the falls. The water thunders, creating lots of spray. It is certainly worth the stop off the ice fields parkway.\"\"Several people recommended that we not miss the Falls. They were right and we were not disappointed. They are powerful and easily accessible. As you walk along the trail, there are many great vantage points. Feeling the spray and hearing the roar of the water are breathtaking. Don't miss it!!!!\"\"I feel churlish giving this awesome sight a rating of 4 instead of 5, but the simple truth is that the enormous number of visitors significantly detracted from the experience. We got there about noon and could barely find a parking space. Moving along the paved trail feeling rather like part of a cattle herd, we often had to wait for a spot at the railing from which to survey and photograph the cascading falls surrounded by lush green trees and blue mountains. Yes, it was all worth it, as you will see if you click on the pictures I've attached. But a word to the wise: get here early or late for a more intimate experience. Even better, try to plan your visit somewhat outside (before or after) the busy summer season. We didn't have that flexibility so just made the best of it. You can too, and still bring back very pleasant if not ideal memories of this beautiful waterfall in its impressive setting.If your timing isn't flexible and you hate crowds, you might consider skipping the falls and heading instead to the nearby Leech (sometimes spelled Leach) Lake picnic area. You won't find rushing water, but you will find still water with simply amazing reflections. I've attached one of the numerous pictures I snapped there, where we were the only visitors and so enjoyed the kind of solitude most conducive to contemplation of nature's wonders. This lovely picnic area would also make a wonderful spot to stop before or after your visit to the noisy, crowded falls. So you might build a picnic lunch or a snack there into your schedule. There's a dock for swimming or boating too. We just stumbled over this magical place on the way to the falls, so wanted to be sure to let you know it is \"\"out there\"\" if you'd like to take advantage of it while visiting Athabasca Falls. It's located on 93A just before it rejoins 93 right by the falls.\"This is a must not miss waterfall even if you've seen hundreds of falls. The power of the water is unbelieveable. It is a sight and sound place. Walking to the falls was well maintained and felt safe.Nice easy walk along the side of the falls. Quite spectacula and very scenic. Car parking next to the falls.The incredible power of the water! It was a rainy day when we went but this didn't spoil the amazing scene.We have been there in the rain and it was worth it. It's impressive how the water seeks it's way down through the rocks.\"Pull over and be prepared to have your breath taken away. A force of nature meets a stubborn landmass and wins, but you can walk back in time along one of its previous attempts to overcome.Genuinely awesome!Please be careful, both above and below the falls. Death has many smooth-talking dealers around here from coy but slippery rocks above to proud yet weakened outcrops below. All of which entice you with the pleasure of being their first human to try and yet have lured many a stranger into their riverbed!Sweet dreams are made of this by mere mortals such as we\"Don't miss stopping at these falls if you are driving through the the ice fields. Phenomenal amount of water coming down the falls. Don't miss all of the different observation areas. They all have different views of the various parts of the falls. Need to spend at least 30 minutes there.\"It is amazingly wonder, the waterfalls, the trees and the rocks even the moss are always wonderfully combined together. You see all different astonishing views while walking along the trail.\"\"If you love the sound of roaring water and the power of water, this is a stop you must make. The paths to the falls are paved and easily traversing. I could truly appreciate the power of water in this place. It's a great stop along the Iceland Highway!\"The easy access to this waterfall meant hoards of people taking selfie upon selfie. I would give this waterfall an excellent rating if it took even a little bit of effort to get to but it is literally right next to the parking lot. Still very beautiful.\"These falls are quite lovely and, happily, just a short walk away from the car park. Very easily accessible and if you follow the path you can get very, very close to the bottom area of the falls.\"We visited the Athabascar Falls on the way to the Columbia Icefields. Not massive but extremely powerful they are worth the trip. Some great photo opportunities.A little walk off the beaten trail but the falls are well worth it. Hard to believe the whole thing freezes solid in the winter.\"We stopped here without expectations this late in the season, but the falls were flowing great and we gpt some great shots, very easy to get too.\"Called in at the falls on the way to Jasper and we only wish we could have spent longer than half an hour exploring the different views. The different viewing platforms ensure that you have great views of the falls from every angle. Short but great stop. Well recommended.Lovely stop on the Icefields Parkway. Short walk to various view points of the falls. Definitely worth going down to the bottom of the canyon and river viewing areas.\"Go early, really nice to see the calls from different angles but also the rochformations from earlier river pathsGeocache is present also\"\"Visited the Athabasca Falls as part of a Rockies tour, the falls and the walk to it are breath taking and worth the walk.\"\"This is about 30 minutes south of Jasper - so a great stop on the way to and from Jasper, or even as a short road trip from Jasper. - easily accessible pathways along the waterfalls- steep stairs down to river but worth it- busy with campers and buses- large parking and picnic area Enjoy the beauty of the Rockies!\"\"Very cool to see where the falls originally started. Beautiful scenery. Nice paved pathways, easy walking.\"This is a small but amazing wonderful canyon. ok it is not the Grand Canyon but it is beautiful in its own right. You get lovely views and you can take a stroll for almost 1.5 hrs (one way) with the river. Definitely worth the trip.\"After seeing the Athabasca Icewalks, this water fall kind of pales unfortunately as it didn't hold the same grand urge. I suggest seeing before you walk the ice\"\"This is the must visit if you are going to Jasper. The serenity of water fall sound and the beautiful Canyon. Few meters walk and you are right at the fall. Jasper and Banff is been blessed by nature. Abundant falls, lakes and canyons. This is one of the largest fall you visit without a hike.\"Along beautiful Icefields Parkway. Good stop easy to see. Hiking id you want or just go to three bridges for great views of the falls.\"The roar of the water was amazing. There's a small trail that will take you down to the river, but first you cross through the channel that the river used to run through! The rocks in the channel are great for photos! All of the walks are paved so it's great for all ages!!\"A short walk will allow you to see these beautiful falls. It was raining when we were here so we were not able to take in the full beauty but still a worthwhile stop.\"So glad we followed our tour book and stopped here! Lovely waterfalls and easy canyon walk not far from Jasper. Places to sit for a picnic, clean outhouse facilities. Enjoyed by many family groups.\"The falls are easy to get to without a lot of walking so they are very accessible to everyone and are absolutely beautiful.\"Pretty falls, you can drive up to there. So, not much walking from the car. Then you can go down the stairs to the river. Nice. I would recommend it :)\"A great experience. The sheer power of the falls and how close you are make this special. The safety touches are very cool.Amazing canyon and waterfalls. Such an interesting place it was bound to be busy and it was! As with all natural attractions in Canada it is well presented and spotlessly clean. Some quite pushy tourists about so keep your elbows handy and watch your step if the paths are wet!\"Not to be missed. You can often see a rainbow in the spray from the falls. Best access is from the Icefields Parkway road, as the 93a from Jasper to Athabasca Falls is in a very poor condition.\"\"If you get a chance to stop for a visit, do it! The setting is stunning, as are the beautiful trails alongside the river / gorge.\"I stopped at the Athabasca Falls to look around and take some pictures. It is spectacular and well worth taking the time to stop.Ok... Don't spend all of your vacation for this. But it's a good 45 minutes to see somethings good. I like fishing and the story about the bull trout there is very interesting\"We stoped here as part the Icefields Parkway Drive from Jasper to Bannf. A relatively short walk, very easy, but a must see place! The falls are beatiful and very powerful. DON'T MISS IT!\"\"It might not be the highest in Canada, but it sure is worth stopping even in the rain. Only 10 minutes from the parking lot on pavement, but it is a little steep a climb.\"I've been coming to Jasper for years and I always love stopping at the Athabasca Falls. It's absolutely worth the extra drive out of Jasper. It's beautiful!\"This would have got 4 stars but in July it's way too busy. I have visited this fall in all seasons and it's worth a quick stop and toilet break. It's free, and outside of summer, it's a relaxing little walk and a good selfie photo backdrop.\"\"These are a condensed version of higher and larger falls. Here you can really get an idea of the way canyons are formed. The layers of rocks cut through by the sheer force of the water, potholes bored into the curves of the lower end.This is Hydro Power in its untamed glory.\"Stop over for an hour or so while on the highway. Short walks to all views of the falls. Can be visited from jasper townsite also.Stunning views and the sound of the water is amazing! Walk down the old spill way to see where the falls runs off. Hard to get down to the lake with a young child but the view at the bottom of the spill way is enough.\"Not as good as other waterfalls in Banff/ Jasper but within 200m reach of the car park. We spent time walking around the old falls also so it took 40- 60 minutes.Free and easy to access for all\"\"We visited with friends who live in Canada, despite setting the falls many times they keep coming back and we can see why.Good parking and a great rest break on the journey from Banff to jasper this is an amazing view and the view points they have built are not intrusiveWould suggest you visit on a sunny day as the spray from the falls becomes iridescent.Pete\"\"Stopped here for 30 minutes on our tour what a spectacular place, one of many things we have seen in this area\"When you go to Jasper the Athabasca Falls are a must. Wear comfortable shoes for the small hike. But the falls are worth seeing.\"We LOVE waterfalls. This was right near our hostel so not only did we enjoy the falls, we journeyed a bit up the path to the river leading to the falls. Here we napped on the rocks in the sunshine surrounded by mountains & NO TOURISTS. Give it a go. Enjoy the falls, be mindful of the memorial for the fella who lost his life, and spend some time on the river, relaxing before the next stop on the way.\"\"This was our second time to the falls. The falls are loud and beautiful. On the downside, expect heavy crowds. Things have changed a bit since our last trip. There are now signs posted throughtout telling people not to be \"\"stupid\"\". Its not the parks fault but on stupid visitors.\"\"Like many of the short hikes we did in Jasper, the Athabasca Falls trails gave us a wonderful variety of views. We saw the falls in July and the amount of water was awe inspiring. We also saw it in pretty steady rain and would still recommend stopping.\"Enjoyed the falls . Great picture opportunities. Worth stopping along Icefields Pkway for this one. Enjoy!The waterfalls is within easy reach from the car park. It is on the way between the Columbia Icefield and Jasper - about 30km to Jasper. The roar of the waterfalls is simply majestic. Not to be missed.It's a nice waterfall with viewpoints on both sides and some paths through the old channels. The views downstream are nice as well.Along the Icefield Parkway another amazing stop and see. Would suggest stop along way as we went past it and drove from Hinton back an hour plus ride back. Simply amazing view and placeThese falls are so beautiful and different from others in the area in that they have created cylindrical craved areas in the rock formations. They are quite stunning and worth the time. Easy walking paths. Some stairs but manageable for most ability levels. Some parts not wheel chair accessible.Scenic falls and interesting rock formations. Follow the walkway to get different views and make this one of your stops on the Icefields Parkway\"Easy hike. Beautiful scenery,even on a rainy day. Well worth the trek. You can easily spend half a day here.\"What a lovely sight as you r driving down the highway. These falls are so close to the road and so good to look at.\"Powerful falls, so hold onto your kids. Beautiful viewpoints, though. Take the time to stop and walk around this area to see the falls.\"The walk along the river lets you see the full power of the river and there are helpful signs explaining the geology of the river and how it has shaped the landscape. The sight is busier than Sunwapta Falls just along the road and the photo opportunities are lessWorth a car drive to see torrenting waterfalls and river canyon. Need Park pass to enter area but lots of stunning scenery wherever you look. Avoid when buses turn up!!!\"Very busy site on the way to the Columbia Ice Fields. Does require some walking to get to, but well worth the walk. It is hard to grasp the scope of the falls and the speed of the water rushing through. Very pictureseque!\"\"This was beyond beautiful. Everyone needs to stop there. You won't ever forget nature at its best. We had read about it, but words just tell it all. Hope everyone gets to see these Falls.\"A well laid out public access. Well maintained. Good paths to get pictures and views of the falls. Interesting natural formations.i was there with family. we walked around the falls and got some nice pictures. a few too many people there but not bad and everyone spreads out quickly. worth stopping in.Great viewing sites on carefully constructed concrete bridges span these picturesque falls with plenty of space for all to see - along with helpful descriptive plaques\"We have past the route from Columbia Ice Fields to Jasper twice before and had not stopped to visit Athabasca Falls. This time was different, so happy we did. Equal parts natural wonder and education makes this a worthwhile 30-60 minute stop.\"\"A must visit attraction. Powerful waterfalls, easy access, another symbol af the Candian RockiesGraet for people from all ages including kids\"If you are driving from Lake Louise to Jasper watch out for the police trap waiting you after the Ice Fields. The speed changes from 90 to 50 and you are going downhill. There are 4-5 police pulling people over. I thought it was an accident so many cars were on the side of the road. Way to welcome visitors CANADA.\"These falls are huge. They're easily accessible from the highway and there's nothing strenuous about the walk around them, they're definitely worth a stop for photos. On a hot day its great to feel the spray coming from them and some good picture opportunities. Just be sure to stay behind the safety barricade, they're immensely powerful!\"These falls are awesome. The volume of water flowing over and down the falls is amazing and well worth going to seeThe glowing reviews on trip advisor lured us to stop at this place as we were on our way to Jasper from Banff. It was one of those rare moments when the place exceeded the hype surrounding it.Definitely bring your camera. You can walk around the falls. I would suggest bring your camera you can even do a little video taping with your phone. It does get crowded at times and is a popular spot for bus tours to stop. But overall it is worth stopping.The Athabasca Falls are one of many must see attractions if you are in the Jasper National Park. The are a few viewing bridges where you can stand and watch the falls thundering down as well as a well deserved selfie or family photograph. it is nature at its best. There are well marked trails telling you where to stand and where it is dangerous to venture. Highly recommended.\"Located in Jasper National Park (30 kilometers south of Jasper town), this is a powerful and picturesque waterfall. The falls can be safely viewed and photographed from various viewing platforms and walking trails around the falls. For those nature-lovers, this is a mandatory stop! Enjoy the fresh air and the sound of water falling into the gorge :-)\"Very beautiful. Definitely worth the stop. This is one of the main attractions on this route. Not very handicap accessible.\"We were heading back to Jasper after visiting the Ice Explorer, these falls are defiantly worth a stop at, the views are amazing!\"This is a must see on your way to/from Jasper. The falls are easy to get to and the views are great.\"Nice little stop off to stretch your legs as you travel up the The Icefields Parkway.The falls themselves are not any distance to walk, plenty of parking, picnic space available.\"\"The pictures we took with our cellphones were amazing. It was very busy, but the set up allows for a clean flow of vehicles and people. Overall a must see for anyone. Would definitely go back.\"\"The trails to the fall are easy to take. Some steps are narrow and steeply, but overall is ok for everyone.The fall itself is not so big, but water stream is very strong.\"A beautiful place to visit. Somewhat crowded when the busses are there. Worth every step of the way of your self guided tour\"Amazing display of the power of water. Due to easy accessibility, can be crowded with tour buses. Probably best to go early or later in day.\"We as a tour group stopped here. It is a short walk to the falls and definitely worth it. The view of the falls is spectacular! The water rushing through the cut rocks is beautiful.This is a nice hidden place. Worth to make a visit as it is not too far from the Fairmont Jasper Lodge.These are really impressive falls with numerous great viewing points from different positions. There is a high flow through them which is mesmerising. A must stop to see. They're pretty busy but there's quite a lot of parking available.Absolutely wonderful trip. Canada has a lot to offer with such beautiful scenery. I highly recommend seeing Athabasca Falls. We enjoyed it as a part of a bus tour.\"Athabasca Falls is a must see, but would recommend going early or later in the day due to the number of people there. We walked out along the river away from the falls and found a nice quite beach to relax.\"If you want to experience a roaring waterfall and the mist spraying your face this is the place! It's a simple walk on a cement path and beautiful views of the falls. There are educational placards along the way too. The backdrop is gorgeous!Easy enough hike and just off the road. It is a great stop and amazing to see natural and it's forces. Get out and go see it!Well worth stopping of to see these thunderous falls . Gets quite busy with lots of coach parties so be prepared to have to wait for photographs as the obligatory selfies by the Chinese but fun watching them !!!Easilly accessible. Great waterfalls and canyon. I especially liked the steps down the small canyon that had once been the route for the river that ran under the main road bridge. Note when exiting the car park - don't believe the sign that says that the 93A route is not surfaced - it is - all the way to Jasper.Take Hwy 93 and not 93A to Athabasca Falls...it will be much faster. Parking was convenient and the trails around the falls was nice and easy.\"My husband and I did a day trip from Jasper to The Athabasca Falls, Sunwapta falls and viewpoints in between. Athabasca Falls were impressive and the scenery was lovely even on a grey day.\"Beautiful falls with nice walking path through a canyon. Amazed at the power of the water cutting through the rocks. Mountains in the background make for some great photo opportunities\"Like everything else in the area this was dramatic.Brewster Tours are highly professional and know the area.\"It is easy access to get to view the falls from different angles just steps from the parking lot. Always amazing to see the power of water against stone.Close to the street you'll find the parking area and within a short walk you can see the beautiful falls. Really worth little stop.This is a must if you're in the area. It only needs half an hour but the reward is great. The sound of the water gushing over the fall and into the pothole and beyond is truly amazing. You get a real sense of its power.We always stop at Athabasca Falls when in Jasper. You cannot be anything but in awe of the power of nature.\"While not Niagara Falls, this is a pretty impressive falls with a huge volume of water and walkways which maximize your view of the falls.Only a 30 minute drive from Jasper.\"\"This was a cool waterfall, specifically the canyon/gorge that it cut in the rocks. Not overly busy when we attended, which was nice.\"Lot of water running down this falls. Very nice even though it is no Niagara Falls. Check out the lower part of the falls Good place for a picnic\"These falls are impressive both in the power of the water, turbulence in the basins, and beauty of the rocks alongside. The canyon is very deep and tortuous. The access path is easy and crosses over in two vantage points for photos. Alittle slippery so be careful.\"Nicely done viewing area! Lower canyon has nice views on the river! Liked it better than Sunwapta falls. Esp nice just before sunsetDefinitely a place to stop off at on your trip from Banfff to Jasper. Extremely popular so if you can go early or late you won't have to jostle for the best photo spots.\"The best part of these falls is that they are accessible to all and that there are many viewpoints. We saw a rainbow right over the falls that seemed magical. Just get there early bc parking fills up quickly and like all these natural beauties, the less people around the more beautiful it seems.\"A beautiful way to see the Canadian Rockies nature taking its course! Powerful water rages through ancient rock makes this waterfall worth seeingOne of the many beautiful stop off points along our trip through the National Park. There is a stunning backdrop to these falls. Please take the time to stop and visit.\"Incredible torrent of water pounding over the rocks with enormous force. You get a new appreciation of the power of water. (At least two benches on the banks with plaques dedicated to young men who decided to get off the excellent boardwalk viewing areas to get close to the water, and paid for it with their lives.) Easily accessible from the park highway, and well worth a stop.\"My favourite place I visited In Jasper and Banff National Parks. The colour of the water is so beautiful and its so majestic and powerful. It looked like there were loads of beautiful trails around too. You can look at it from different viewpoints and you can walk down to the river on the otherside that it leads too as well. Definately will come back again.It is fascinating to see the way the rock flour and silt from the Athabasca River has carved out the rocks. It's breath-taking and worth-while the stop as you travel down the Iceland's HighwayBeautiful views and narrow walkways with the water cascading through the gorge at all angles. It really is a must if you are in the area.\"If you like waterfalls, don't miss this one! Impressive! The rocks colors and the power of the water combine to make for a worthy roadside stop along icefields parkway.\"This is a must visit if you are in the area. The power of the water is truly amazing. Great display boards giving information about the falls and the area. Get there early if you can before the coach parties arrive. Lovely walks in area to view the falls from different places.the falls were beautiful and i got lots of great pictures. it is easy to get to and great for everyone. the only down side like with many activities in canada is that the parking situation is not greatMy husband proposed to me here 12 years ago and this is the first time we have been back since - with our four kids in tow! It is beautiful and I could stay there for hours listening to the water and checking out the gorgeous mountains. We walked down through the rock formations to the river the falls flow into. It is just nature at its finest.Always awe-inspiring to see the power of nature! You can spend as much or as little time as you want there.\"A spectacular waterfalls and beautiful rock canyon. Easy access by car, close walking distance to the falls.Just a few miles outside of Jasper.Mountain views around the waterfalls.Large parking lot.\"\"There are plenty of amazing sites to visit in the Rockies, especially throughout Jasper.Athabasca Falls is great if you are travelling in large groups, with children or you generally need easy access. Get there early before the tour buses. At 8am you will have the carpark to yourself, after 10..good luck finding a place...to park or stand.However I was a little disappointed as I thought Id see a more vertical fall. White Water Rafting on the other side of the falls was fun, and a good class II rapid.\"\"Stand next to Mother Nature’s fury and experience the full force of Athabaska Falls. The rushing water exudes an overwhelming sense of power both visually as well as in the cool mist and near deafening roar. The recreation area also has some paved walkways that wind through cavernous conduits over the runoff from the falls, leading to a platform overlooking where the canyon flushes out into a wide river again. We stopped at Athabasca Falls on a whim during a road trip through the Icefields Parkway. This is well worth the pull over and a spectacular sight. We were there during the busiest part of the season – mid-august – and consequently a hoard of tourists had also flooded the lookout decks. Seems like everyone wanted to take excessive selfies and photos next to the falls, which really created an annoying bottleneck of self-absorbed tourists flashing absurd poses behind cameras. Tried not to let that ruin the experience. My girlfriend returned in early April this year and said it was less inspiring because the spring runoff had not yet begun. The falls were half frozen and hadn’t reached the full potential of water flow, so my suggestion would be to go later in the summer for the full effect. Pros:-Spectacular natural showcase of a river waterfall-Easily located in a pull-off on the north section of the Icefields ParkwayCons:-Tourists. Tourists everywhere.\"\"not a hiking trip, but an accessible little waterfall with the Rockies around. ON the way from Jasper to Banff/Lake Louise, close to Jasper. So one could easily do a quick trip from Jasper to see it.\"\"Nice set of waterfalls, easy walk. Impressive falls, but not quite as nice as Sunwapta. There are several viewing platforms, some that let you get quite close and feel the mist of the falls. There are a couple flats trails around the falls area if you want to spend more time here, but personally I'd make it more of a quick stop. It was a very nice stop along the icefields parkway, but I wouldn't plan on spending more than 30-45 minutes. I'm not sure why it is ranked #1 of things to do in Jasper. Spend a little less time here, and more time the Horseshoe lake which is a couple minutes away.\"Great canyon rock formations and powerful fall! On highway 93 so that you can just stop by for 15 to 30 minutes on the way to Jasper or Lake Louise.\"These falls are amazing, lots of water and very loud. Easy to park and not much of a walk to reach the falls. There are plenty of vantage points for photos, each viewing spot was just as impressive as each other. Well worth visiting\"\"Athabasca Falls is a must stop, easy on/off from Icefields Parkway and only about 3040 minutes south of Jasper. Worth a 30-60 minute stop regardless of the weather. great viewing from both sides of the Falls\"This is a popular and crowded stop but it's worth doing. We lucked out and got a break from the rain while there. Very impressive to see and hear the power of the water going through the canyon.We stopped here on our way to Jasper from Banff. Very nice falls and views! Another great spot to take a break along the Icefields Parkway!\"Stunning location easy to get to from car park although if you want to walk further lots of steps up and down.The waterfall is beautiful and the sort of place photographers will love.Quiet busy so early morning or evening would be good\"\"Our experience of these falls was quick and impressive. A quick pull off of the highway and a very short walk to the falls. There are many different vantage points, with good signage and information. The path continues through an old canyon carved by the falls many many years ago and opens to the calm river downstream.This is well worth the stop!\"On our trips to the Rockies we have passed this. On this trip we stopped and I'm so glad we did! WOW! The walking path is perfect to enjoy the noise and grandeur of the river as it drops thru canyons along the way. There are many scenic places along the way. Most of it is accessible by all. Definitely a place to see!This is a very easy walk appropriate for almost anyone. I did see a couple of people with crutches and a wheelchair. Not quite sure they could manage the back side which is where the best view is.Glorious waterfall with a incredible feel. the sound of the rushing water and the carved eroded rocks are amazing.Spectacular sights and sounds . So glad we stopped . Busy but plenty vantage points . Easy access off highway and easy parking . Well worth a look\"Alot of people here, but we still enjoyed the falls. You can view at different levels and also walk to the canyon/river part of the area. Worth the stop.\"\"Worth half an hour to visit these falls off Highway 93.Easy access from the parking lot and not a long walk. Options to go to the lower falls which takes more effort, and probably not worth it!\"\"Always a favourite. You can hear the falls before you see them. there are many vantage points where you can view the falls from different angles. On a good day in the canyon to the left of the falls you can see a very distinct rainbow, worth the wait when it is crowded. The walk down the canyon gives an indication of the changes in the terrain showing the layers of rock laid down through the ages.\"\"The falls are easily accessed from the car park so, this is a popular stop for the tour buses. It is lovely here and the river and falls cut a nice gorge into the slow moving flat part of the river.I was more impressed with Maligne Canyon but this is quite beautiful as well.\"always a magnificent view worth the walk from the parking lot. a shame they cannot make a larger viewing area with all of the people that come to see it. closer parking for elderly and handicapped would be very nice. why should only tour buses park closer.You arrive and first see the falls from the top. You then move down from the falls and have the option to see the falls from the other side. This waterfall is very narrow with nice rock formations on both sides. Very powerful and just hope it's not raining when you visit.\"Yes, this is one of the places tourists flock to, but since we'd hiked and driven all over Jasper and managed to avoid swarms of tourists, we didn't mind too much seeing these awesome falls. Of course, it would be nice if people had a clue and didn't monopolize all the views while they took 95 pictures and selfies, but that's tourists for you. Definitely a nice stop to get out and admire the canyon and falls and then be on your way.\"We went early in the morning (about 8AM) to try and avoid the crowds we had heard about. It totally worked as there wasn't even a tour bus in the parking lot. It's a short walk from the parking lot and there are many viewing areas where you can get some great pictures or just stand and feel the power of nature as it roars past you.\"This falls was powerful and swift, a short walk from parking lot. You must stop here and see this awesome force of nature!\"There is a large free parking area. It is a short walk top the falls. There are good viewing areas. Well worth the stop & walk - took many photos !\"Another beautiful place in the Canadian rockies. These falls are a short and easy walk away. Very beautiful especially with the mountain peak in the background.You can also see rainbows at various angles!\"Stop for half an hour and enjoy these beautiful falls. It is a short and not taxing walk with great viewing platforms to observe from.Stop off point on the way from Lake Louise to Jasper. Well worth stopping off here. It's an easy trail that unwinds to reveal stunning views and a truly beautiful waterfall.\"Definitely a highlight along the Icefields Parkway that warrants a stop. But, being so accessible from the road, prepare for crowds especially at peak hours. I think a lot of people make the drive a day trip from Banff and arrive at the Falls early to mid afternoon and then head back.\"This is one amazing falls very much so worth the stop lot of different place to see it from and take pictures the noise from the fall is very loudWe called in during our tour and were amazed at the size of the areas and angles available to photograph this natural phenomenon.\"Well woth visiting, but gets seasonally busy with coach loads of visitors making photographs difficult without patience.\"A great stop on the Icefield Parkway. fantastic falls.Ignore the crowds and walk a little fiurther towards the lakeA must-see! We went later in the afternoon when the crowds were minimal. The power of the water is amazing and worth the visit.\"Athabasca falls are impressive and definitely worth a visit. Try and time your visit early in the morning or later in the afternoon when the crowds are less. We attended during peak times and did laps of the car park trying to find somewhere to park, but after we found one and viewed the falls , we understood why it was so popular.\"The falls are beautiful and worth the stop on the highway. We spent about 30 minutes enjoying a few of the viewpoints. The power of water is in full display at this site.\"Nature at its best.Clean safe concrete walk ways, good railings for safety, and many viewpoints to take amazing pictures.Lots of free parking, several clean washrooms.\"While travelling along Highway 93 it's worth making a stop to visit the falls. Just watching and listening to the rush of water is both exhilarating and peaceful.\"a place to stop and rest the legs and have a great picnic.The pictures and and the views are worth the stop.\"The Falls and the canyon were beautiful. There are several walkways that give differing views of the falls and the effect of the water on the surrounding rocks. One of the walks is down an old channel of the falls and you can see where the water cut the rocks.\"I'm torn on what to write. I'm giving it a \"\"very good\"\" rating because I loved it when I was a kid, but it didn't have the same impact on me the second time I went as an adult. It's a good way to kill 30-60 minutes. The views are stunning and you'll have the opportunity to take a lot of nice pictures, but it isn't a situation I love. It feels like a Banff attraction that is in Jasper. It was packed with tourists the two times I went. That kind of takes away from the experience for me. You want to take a moment to soak in the view, but you also don't want to be rude to the people waiting to stand in that prime spot. There are a few areas where it can get pretty congested. I'd also recommend bringing a light jacket. You might not need it but there's a fairly constant breeze that can make it a little cold. There are other places around Jasper that I would recommend over the Athabasca Falls, but there is something special about seeing that powerful water flowing.\"\"Easily accessible waterfall with high volume. Below, there are whirlpools carved into bedrock before spilling out into a lake about 3 blocks below falls. Well worth the stop needed to see them, as they are so readily accessible.\"Easy access to impressive falls. Beautiful mountain in the background. Climb down to the bottom through the staircase made out of the rock. Beautiful area. Only con is it is filled with people and many are rude. Lots of tour bus visitors that swarm.Plan at least 30 minutes to walk around and photograph the falls and river. This is probably the nicest stop along the highway between Banff and Jasper.\"We went to the falls at noon. A very nice place to go.The waterfalls are lovely and also the views nearby.A site you must if it's on the way.\"The snow was melting and feeding this incredible waterfall. The volume of water and the constant roar was amazing.A hiking path winds along the river and falls. You can go as far as or as short as you want. Great viewsHuge waterfall with almost no hiking or climbing required. Numerous viewpoints. Can also climb down to the bottom of the falls where the join the river.Great views of the waterfalls and rivers. We liked walking around the short trails to see different views of the falls and river. Only thing we didn't love was that there were a lot of tourists. As we walked farther away from the falls there...More\"Travelled in June 2016We were staying at jasper and drove to the falls about 45 minutes away.They were stunning not the biggest falls I have seen but well worth a visit and it's freeEnough said\"Beautiful falls with mountain backdrops. There is lots of free parking and paved trails to walk. They have washrooms in the parking lot.\"Not faraway from Jasper. It was really impressive to see such a beautiful fall! With the change of the sun, the view was changing as well.\"\"The falls are not very high, but they are very cool and powerful.Go early in the morning if you want to avoid crowd!\"We would recommend getting a rafting tour down the river. Great for families with children 6 plus. Not scary at all\"We visited these falls as part of our day tour/transfer from Jasper to Lake Louise. It was booked through Brewster Tours, who provided an excellent driver/knowledgeable guide to the area and an attentive on board tour manager. Brewster were reliable, picked us up hotel to...More\"This place is not to be missed! A very beautiful place for picture taking. So close to nature. Just wonderful. Quite a number of tour buses parked when we came so sort of crowded. Its June and lots of water flowing and was just amazing.\"We were on our way from Banff to Jasper and this was on the way. Great stop, worth it for the falls, there are various lookouts and plenty of info boards.\"Beautiful waterfalls that provide plenty of photographic opportunities at different angles - so bring your camera and make sure the audio is turned on (if you shoot a video). The sound is amazing.\"Like the rest of the Rockies, just gaze in awe. Ferocious falls and beautiful green blue lake.....even on a gloomy day........ We stopped on our way back to Banff - definitely worth a visit as you're passing, or a trip out from Jasper.\"\"An interesting geological feature formed by the power of the Athabasca River carving a ravine through the rock over the last period since the Ice Age. The power and volume is impressive. A short walk guides you to the viewing spits, it can be busy. There are excellent viewing points to the North , outside the main car park. Combine this with a slow drive along 93A towards Jasper, thus old road is great for scenery and wildlife.\"It was kind of a rainy day but we decided to see the glaciers and Athabasca Falls. Both were easy to get to and stunning. The Falls are so accessible and so beautiful -- now in the first part of July when there is so much water#! Don't miss out.\"I don't think I can add anything different than what previous reviewers have said, so I'll confirm the consensus that these falls are a definite do not miss!\"\"My son saw the sign for the falls on our way to the site and asked if we could go. It is an easy hike and the falls are very nice. We even got to watch the rafters leave down the back side of the trail. The view was much more spectacular before all of the fences were installed, but common sense is no longer common, so the fences are necessary.\"Don't miss these falls. Its a very easy walk accessible for mostly anyone. The views of the falls are amazing! Take your camera.\"These falls have many parts and it's worth seeing them all. Try to get there early to avoid the crowds. The power of these falls is something else. Read the signs and be careful, too many have not been. Would highly recommend.\"\"We walked all the way to the bottom to stand by the river, and enjoyed every part of the journey down.\"\"Before the visit, I thought it would be just like any other waterfall in Alberta. But once I visited, I was convinced why this tops the list of things to do in Jasper. I don't usually get too excited by waterfalls, but this is so beautiful, violent and amazing. The force of water so enormous and it has carved out the rocks. You can see these falls from different views and all views leads to great experience :). I would really go again and feel the beauty of mother nature.\"You must visit this place. Pretty awesome ewspecially after a lot of rain .A must for keen photographers.A lot of water flows over these falls. Nice. It had just rained and the walkways were a little slippery.\"The Falls have cut changing channels over the centuries and you can walk to the river through which the river no longer flows. They are beautiful all year round, and very different in winter.\"\"Besides being large and complex, this is falls is uniquely beautiful because of the way the blue-green glacial water has carved through many narrow colorful strata of rock. One of a kind. Probably what I liked least is the distance of the falls from home in Virginia, USA\"Great spot for rainbows from the mist coming off the raging water. Lots of things to read about along the trails they have set up for safety. You can safely view the falls from many different angles getting lots of photo's. There are trails up above and down below the falls. It's about 25 kms towards the icefeilds from Jasper. The Mountains keep getting more excellent looking as you approach the ice fields.\"We live in New Zealand, and we thought we had some beautiful waterfalls, but you have to experience Canada for this.\"A short drive from Jasper to this amazing place. Open car park and a short 2 minute walk to the falls (note it does get very busy).A spectacular view of the falls by following them down steam by the canyons. The force of the water is quite loud and amazing to see. Worth seeing!I would definitely stop here to check out the falls. They are beautiful and there are also picnic tables where you can stop to have a meal. Great stop! No cost but you do have to pay to get into the park.\"Although this is a very busy and often crowded place, it is worth at least a quick stop. The falls roar down the canyon, and the start of the falls is pretty with the mountain backdrop. The colors of the layers of rock in the canyon are beautiful. Take the little detour down to the lower lake for another pretty view.\"These falls are a short drive from Jasper and will not disappoint you! The wild churning water makes its' way through the rocks and has carved out some amazing rocks! See what nature is capable of doing! Do not miss this!Thirty kilometres outside Jasper this is well worth a visit. Stunning waterfall and a lovely walk. The scenery is beautiful.\"This is very spectacular, it gives you a respect for time and place. It worth spending an hour working around and admiring the beauty of the falls.\"So much stunning scenery in the Rockies but this is a must see!Easy to access from car park and likely to be very busy from coach tours but most stop long enough to take all the photos you need. Seek out the less obvious views\"This is really easily accessible and only takes about 20 minutes for most to enjoy. It's a great quick stop along your travels and well worth a brief visit.Breathe deeply and live richly...\"\"Easy to walk around and amazing views. Highly recommend spending a while here, you don't have to walk for miles to see it.\"The falls were gorgeous and free from trash and debris unlike some parks. Great photo opportunities are all around the falls.\"These falls are just off the main highway and it is a short, easy walk from the parking lot to the falls. We stopped on the way from Banff to Jasper after being advised to do so. The falls are in a gorgeous setting with the mountains behind. Not as impressive as some we have seen but still worth the visit.\"\"Although not so high, these falls are thunderously powerful so that you can feel the vibration in your body. The walk ways are carefully fenced with plenty of warnings about the danger of straying beyond them along with sad mementos of those who did so and fell to their deaths. We walked the river path and also through the tunnels left from where the river previously pounded through. Fascinating  to see the sculpture of so many years. Beyond the last fall we watched whitewater rafters launch and whizz down river. \"\"we stopped here very early friday morning, was so peaceful, no one were there yet. I suggest to stop by as early as possible\"\"Beautiful falls, showing the power of the water. It was great to be able to get so close. I could have stayed for hours watching and listening to the roar of the falls.\"\"Yes it is a falls of a sort but not as high as expected, but the roar of the falls is wonderful. Visited when it wasn't too crowded so had plenty of places for photos and just to reflect on the rush of water and views.\"\"Beautiful waterfall, quick stop, lots of people. Maybe go early in the morning before it gets busy. Only takes about 1/2 hour to walk around and see the falls and river from different view points.\"The falls themselves are not overly spectacular but the river running below is breathtaking. Would definitely stop especially since access to the falls is close to the parking lot. Not wheelchair accessible.\"Amazing waterfall in the majestic Jasper National Park. A must see!! There are walkways and paths around the canyon that is formed by the waterfall (do NOT climb over the fencing, it is dangerous as the rocks are slippery when wet and tourists have lost their lives in search of the \"\"special photo\"\").\"\"The falls are about 44 miles west of the Icefields Glacier Discover Centre and 20 miles to the east of Jasper. Very easy and convenient path to the falls. There is a 1/2 mile paved trail, with concrete bridges over the gorge. There is an interpretative trail explaining the geography. Very nice stop\"\"Well worth a stop to see these falls. While not the most dramatic of waterfalls, they are in a very pretty setting and still impressive.\"Thoroughly enjoyed this! Stopped here on the way from Jasper to Lake Louise. The Canadian Rocky Mtn. parks department should be commended for the excellent way they have designed the parks so visitors can get the absolute best views in a safe setting. They allow us to get so much closer to the rushing water than we would otherwise be able to do. Kudos to them for the excellent walkways!These fall are easy to get to and handicap accessible. They are beautiful with the mountains surrounding them yet very powerful. There are many opportunities for the photography buffs to take some amazing pics.\"Amazing falls. Just try to get there before the peek hour so you can enjoy them better. Easy walk, very advised.\"\"A quick & easily accessible stop on the side of the road, the mass of water thundering over a short drop & through a narrow chasm is frightening. Keep behind the barriers - there is a memorial to someone who didn't!\"\"We stopped here as part of our tour on the way to Jasper so the only regret was that we didn't have more time here and get to do a proper walk, but what we did see it looked a wonderful place. Well worth a visit just allow yourself more time here, we were restricted for time because of the tour and being in a group.\"\"It was a gorgeous day when we arrived at this stop on our Rockies tour. The bright sunshine with the snowy peaks as a backdrop was stunning.As you walk from the car park your ears are confronted with a cacophony of noise like thunder. Suddenly you catch glimpses of the river through the trees. As you walk on the noise gets louder and louder and then \"\"BAM\"\" you see the awesome sight of the falls in all their glory.There are several really good photo spots where you can snap the falls from different angles.A beautiful picturesque spot.Another awesome location.Canada sure knows how to spoil you!!!\"\"The whole Jasper park is a gem, including Athabasca fall. Views are spectacular, even after seeing many falls within I asked and Banff.\"\"We visited a visitor center in Banff, and this was one of the places he highlighted on our map. Wow. What incredible beauty!\"Definitely worth a visit being just off the main Route 93. Lots to see from different perspectives from the falls through the canyon and out into calmer turquoise waters.Make sure to walk all the trails through the rocks where the river once ran. From the parking lot you can walk in 3 minutes to the head of the falls.\"what a fantastic place to visit that will inspire you and delight you, you will have endless place along the route to take some fantastic photos of this awesome place\"Very fierce waterfall. Can view from many spots. Worth a look. About a 30 minute drive from Jasper. Well signed. Allow 30-60 minutes.\"There are lots of waterfalls to see when touring the area but this is one worth seeing. Interesting range of features to see such as old route of falls lots of viewing areas big falls there is a back road at end of road which is not \"\" rough\"\" as the sign suggest. Interesting road less travelled and differ t views to see. We saw black bear on this track and it also leads to turn off just before Jasper to Edith Cavell Glacier for us a highlight. The road to the Glacier is tight but we saw black bear and grizzly in the morning (after 9.00am so not too early from Jasper)\"\"Cloudy day, but the falls were beautiful and easy to walk to with several overlooks. There was a sign saying that American Dippers (a very cool unusual small bird who swims in mountain streams) was present. We found one up river from the falls. Great site!\"\"If you love to see the power of mother nature in water, its a must see. Lots of different and good viewing spots.\"About twenty minutes from Jasper. Can be visited before you arrive to Jasper or after you leave Jasper on your way to Banff.Breathtaking! Can be crowded.our guide was full of knowledge so he told us lots of stories about this place. Amazing to see and would recommend a visit.\"These falls show the true power of water, its amazing .beautiful setting worth a visit. there are walk trails along the river were you can study the full flow of the river\"\"We really enjoyed our time at the falls. I had only visited with a person in a wheelchair previously and so viewing options were very limited but this time I was able to wander to all parts of the falls. There are lots of informative notice boards so can understand the history, nature, and safety issues. Well worth seeing including the stairway to the lower canyon.\"We visited the Athabasca Falls this morning and walked round the pathways. It was absolutely beautiful and we loved every moment. Well worth the stop.\"Athabasca and Sunwapta falls are well worth the stop. Short hikes that everyone can make. Spend an entire day driving the Icefields parkway between Banff and Jasper, it is awesome.\"The falls are so close to the road. And you only have to walk about two minutes to get to them after parking. Beautiful river and falls. A nice gentle hike. Even those who don't like heights should be able to enjoy these falls. The water sounds relaxing and beautiful.\"A short walk from the car park, the falls are small but very powerful. The canyon is well worth seeing and there are some very interesting short trails.H which make a very unusual photograph.ighly recommend going to the lowest trail to the beach where there at least 20 stone man statues\"The fall is very close to parking lot. We walked around the fall a little bit and found it to be really beautiful. It won't take one hour to see the whole area. Nice.\"This is a beautiful waterfall with nearby looped hiking that leads through a small canyon with viewpoints of the river. It is a bit tough to walk around especially if there are a lot of people or if you have mobility difficulties, but it is overall paved. The water is incredibly blue here and it is fun to see several different things (falls, river, canyon) in the area rather than just one attraction.\"\"We stopped at Athabasca Falls on our drive to Lake Louise AB from Jasper AB. We stopped early in the morning and pretty much had the place to ourselves. Very pretty Falls, the color of the water never stops amazing me! Worth the stop and free!\"\"The Athabasca Falls are absolutely something to see. The color of the water might make you think you were in the Caribbean, but a cold wind brings you right back to Canada.\"\"Athabasca Falls are a beautiful, not-to-missed falls in Jasper National Park. Not just the falls but the whole area with the various lookouts, the small canyon down to the Athabasca River is just beautiful. Tends to be quite busy and crowded but well worth the visit.\"\"walkway is on the far interior end, and parking lot is 2 levels, ground is uneven, 3 viewpoints only 1 of which has the falls. Some uphill walking, \"\"stairs\"\" are 1 set of stairs and the rest are broken rocks, it can be done, but take your time, go slow, the place was PACKED and its every man for himself there, oh, and pit toilets- pretty bad.\"\"Worth the trip to see the might of the river flowing through the gorge and the colour of the water, truly amazing and so beautiful\"Always awe inspiring even though we have been here many times over the last 30 years. This fall is very near from the highway. The water level was high during this visit. The surrounding views are beautiful. There is always a crowd here. Plenty of photography viewpoints. On certain occasions rainbows can be seen in the water vapors thrown out by the waterfall.\"We travelled Alberta starting in Athabasca, then Edmonton, and into the Rockies to Jasper, Lake Louise, Banf, and out to Calgary. The stop at Athabasca Falls was well worth it, beautiful site and nice walking paths. If you're making the trip between Jasper and Lake Louise, make this stop.\"We paid a brief visut to this spot on tour but enjoyed its beauty and magnifence. The variety of colour and clarity of the water make a great place to visit.\"The Falls are between Jasper and the Columbia Icefield -- it was a nice spot to walk around and there are some rafting trips that are there. I would recommend if you have time taking the \"\"back road\"\" to Jasper for some awesome glacial lakes and side roads that are lovely and a little quieter. LOTS of people here when we were here (the busiest spot besides the icefield on our trip)\"\"We visited while travelling between Lake Louise and Jasper and were very glad that we did, it's just at the side of the road but would have been quite a trip from Jasper. Well worth it anyway, very beautiful place and some nice gentle hikes here.\"Jasper national park was very scenic and the Athabasca falls was spectacular. One can visit any number of times and still not get enough!\"The fall together with the rainbow looked breathtakingly beautiful.Overall it was an amazing experience\"Do not miss this. It will be crowded. The colors and sights around are great. We combined this with the ice fiieldsAwesome a must see stopped there on way home loved being there scenery and falls are breathtaking I can also hike down and come up to a lake with outstanding viewsThis was worth a stop for us. Despite being busy it was really a beautiful place to see. The viewing platforms are well designed and with a quick walk you can see the river below the falls too. I can see this would definitely be crazy busy in July and August though.Don't miss this stop on the Icefields Parkway! Easy parking and stunning views. The falls will inspire you with their beauty and overwhelm you with the power of water.\"Lovely views, easy walking (just be careful not to slip!) and great photo opportunities. The interpretive guide plaques are interesting to read.Heed the warnings and do not go off the paths - it is not worth the risk to your life.\"Beautiful. The scenery up to the falls is breathtaking. The falls are just fabulous. Great photo opportunity. Remember to take your camera and video recorder and water. There are no shops en route.Have seen a few water falls across the world in my time and this is an average spectacle of water and its power. The falls are easily accessible from the car park and have well laid out pathways around the various angles that you can view them. The day we visited it had been raining so the water was high and the falls were in full force - look out for the cut outs that the water has created in the canyon walls\"Worth spending a little time to see. Spectacular. Accessible. Memorable. See it when it is sunny and bright, or cloudy and snowy as it was when we saw it.\"Make sure you go to the lower falls area too! It takes about 15-20min but well worth your time. There is a small beach area at the lower falls\"The walk is short to the falls and has some interesting rock formations. There are some stairs on either side of the falls.A gem!\"\"If your driving past, you need to hop out and have a look. The power of the water is amazing and the colour of the water never gets old to look at. Nice spot to stop for a lunch and take a 2km walk after lunch down to the bottom of the falls\"An amazing view from every bridge! We did about half the trek. Not for folks in moderately shape. I would suggest paying for guided hike so you can experience all of the falls if you dont walk to walk the whole length if falls back up to your car.Stopped with a tour group and was so happy we did. This is a beautiful waterfall and area. It's convenient and right off the main road and you could see most in 20 minutes if you are in a hurry.Interesting to see the power of the river as it carved out the rock. Short walk to see and hear the falls shouldn't be missed.So nice to have this scenic stop within walking distance!! This is a must see when traveling the Icefields Parkway!These were some of the more awe-inspiring waterfalls in this area. Quite majestic! It was neat that stairs were created down the old waterways so you can see up close how the water shaped the rock. I enjoyed feeling the pounding of the water and the refreshing mist (best vantage point on the other side of the bridge to the left).These stunning falls are well worth a visit. Visually beautiful they remind you of the power of nature! Great photo opportunity of a fabulous feature of the Canadian Rockies! You must see them whilst in the area. Highly recommended!\"Worth a visitIn a watery landscape these are a must visit. As everywhere here, the paths are well cared for, litter free, and all seem rather understated.\"\"It is different from the other parts of Banff with special \"\"land scape\"\". I love it and spent some time taking pictures. The fall itself is not that great, but it is good as a whole.\"\"Really enjoyed the walk, great photo opportunities, lots of places to explore and really friendly people. Make sure you pack some warm layers..\"\"We had poor weather when we visited Athabasca falls but it was spectacular despite the this. The rain made for a powerful surge of water coming through this narrow gorge, great photo opportunity. Ample car parking facilities, well worth a stop on our road trip.\"The Athabasca falls are just off Highway 93 near Jasper. The falls are breathtaking and extremely interesting. Access to the different viewing spots provides fantastic photo opportunities. One of our favorite stops on our trip.\"...what else can you say to the water coming down from melting ice glaciers..trails were marked and hiking was not too taxing..great find!\"\"Stopped here briefly on our way to Jasper, it looked beautiful in the rain. There are several overlooks along the paved walk way to stop and admire the view.\"\"Worth a stop, right off the highway, very convenient. Wonderful trails all around the top to bottom of the falls.Please stay on the trails...\"Make sure you visit this site. It is really one of natures great wonders. Some walking but very accessible for most.The falls are spectacular!!! It's a short and easy hike to the several vantage points. Stop at each one for a different angle of these beautiful falls.\"The falls themselves are not massive, but still seem quite spectacular, but it is more the surrounding area that evelates this as a great place to visit. The water is so incredibly blue (depending upon the time of year you visit) and there are well laid out paths, with informative information boards. Easy to spedn a few hours wandering around and taking it all in.\"The falls are beautiful! There are paved walking trails with written information at points of interest. The falls are just off the icefields parkway. I highly recommend stopping in to view the falls. You won't be disappointed.The amount and power of the water is very impressive. Several different viewing spots give a lot of photo ops. This was not my favorite stop on the Ice Fields Parkway but was the best waterfalls that we saw.\"Unbelievable amount of water rushes right by you here and the noise is deafening. The access to the falls is easy and plenty of cueing platforms despite the crowds, loved this place!!!!!\"Athabasca Falls is where the falls passes through various channels and the water is absolutely amazing colors of blue/green where the water passes through the various canyon channels. This is right off the highway is easily accessible and has plenty of free parking. It really is one of the coolest stops that you will find and a great picture photo opportunity place.\"Visitors get a sense of the impermanence of their lives as they view the vast falls which will be around long after we are all gone. The awe inspiriting mist clouds spray up to create a moist atmosphere that plays with the light, making pictures all the more pretty. Of all the falls in the area, this was my absolute favorite!\"\"We visited after some heavy rain and the water coming down over the falls greatly increased. The power and strength of the water is literally awesome, and the scenery and views are stunning\"Amazing how the swirling water has rounded out some of the rocks. Lots of photo opportunity. Toilet facilities by parking lot and drinking waterThe sheer power of the water is amazing. It is easy to move around the various view points. To see how the water has eroded the rock over time is really awesome.The falls were awesome. I had no idea how great they would be. There is a short 20 minute loop walk where you can see and HEAR the falls. We did not go on the longer trails but the loop walk was well worth visiting.Well worth stopping off and visiting this area. The surroundings have not been spoiled too much even though it is a very popular tourist attraction. The falls are stunning and show the real power of nature. Signage and information quite good but public toilets are revolting holes in the floor with awful smells!\"Definitely worth a visit, spectacular. Fantastic waterfalls but make sure you use the loo prior to arriving as the on site ones left you gagging for breath. Don't let that put you off though.\"I love the mountains! I love the falls. I just didn't like the vandals left by some inconsiderate tourists. I can stay here to relax my mind. I dont think I will get tired of looking at the falls and the mountainThis was our first stop on our way from Jasper to Lake Louise. The weather was not ideal but the beauty of the falls were spectacular nonetheless. Plenty of places to take photos and view the natural beauty on offer. Definitely make a stop here.\"Not the highest falls that you have ever seen but the water does come through a very small gap and is pretty impressive. Good car park, close to the falls and with pristine toilet facilities. Great viewing positions.\"\"Stopped here on my way out of Jasper heading to Banff. I hit it early in the morning so there weren't any crowds (or tour buses). Very easy, short hike to check out these spectacular falls. Definitely worth a stop; give yourself at least 30 minutes to take in the beauty.\"After reading reviews here I knew we wanted to be sure to stop while in the area. We were not disappointed we did. We walked down to the bottom and up to the top - beautiful from any view point.Waterfall is located on Hway 93 when traveling from Jasper to Lake Louise. Well signed. The only negative in visiting this point of interest is there is a 250 m walk which could be difficult for individuals with mobility issues. Great photo op. No entrance fee.The view is awesome and breathtaking to see Mother Nature at its picturesque the sounds of the waters rushing through the canyon wow\"You cannot visit Jasper with stopping here. We went in late November so nothing was ploughed, just make sure you have good winter gear and boots that come up to your knees and you will be fine. It was well worth the effort to see the part frozen falls.\"An awesome experience. The supreme power of nature is in full evidence during the visit. The vantage points are superbly positioned to watch ' Mother Nature' in all her glory.\"Visited in June 2016. Loved the falls and it was easily accessible.The canyon is beautiful, Will visit again.\"\"The nature is so serene. This falls is amazing. There is a small trail too and can view falls via canyon.Attached are pics.\"\"The falls are beautiful but for me the best part was going down the canyon towards the riverbank, where the beach is covered with hundreds of inukshuks people have made. This is the perfect place to have some lunch and look out over the river as it exits the canyon.\"I had 3 other companions when we traveled towards Calgary and the driver stopped here for us to have a walk and see the falls. I can only write that it has not got old looking at these deep canyons and stunning waterfalls. Thus one did not disappoint. Please take the time go view the falls and you will not be disappointed.\"Call in plenty of advance, they do require a min 3 night stay in the on season. request cabin 3,6,8, everytime i go its always sad to check out.\"I love waterfalls and this one is great. It's does not have views coming down from the mountains but it's great anyway. You can watch it go through the caverns and heard the water levels change so with the water level up I bet it would be spectacular. It's just off the road so not. Much walking involved. Definitely worth the stop!Don't know why I have never stopped here before? So beautiful... short 2 minute walk to the falls so it is suitable for all ages. There are other hikes that can go much further down the canyon but I did not go.. The area can be slippery so be careful and the falls are powerful so watch the little ones... if you went over the railings I think you would be a goner for sure.Amazing experience. Visited twice and enjoyed both times. Amusing signs that were also informative. Got some great photos.\"Make sure this is on your list of things to do in Jasper. Through time, water has carved itself a deep path through rocks and mixed in with that blue blue water, this place is a must see. They even made cement stairs that go through some of these tall rock carved areas which was really cool to walk through and touch. Lots of photo spots along the way and easy to access once you park, no hike needed.\"\"If you are travelling highway 93 between Jasper and Banff or only staying in Jasper this is a worthwhile stop off. The power of the falls is impressive and it's location is beautifulFrom the parking lot it is a short walk to the falls and some short hikes to get different view points above or below the falls. A fence was built to stop people going out onto the wet, slippery rocks to get a photo or selfie but it seems that every year someone climbs over of goes around the fence, slips on the rocks and is killed. You can take highway 93 to and from the falls but highway 93A between Jasper and the falls is much quieter and gives the chance to visit Mt Edith Cavell.\"The falls are easily accessible and are particularly good in the late spring. They can be viewed from many different angles. There is also a hiking trail.Many varied views of the falls and deep chasms. Go early as it gets very crowded. Many of the walkways are paved with bridges across the falls with varied views.\"I liked this stop on the IceField Parkway as the falls are not a long hike from the parking lot. In fact they are really no hike at all, no special footwear needed. It's easy for handicapped and elderly persons to see a spectacular view. The viewing areas are so well done and allow you to see the falls on one side and beautiful serene mountain lake on the other. Well worth the stop.\"Gorgeous views of carved waterfalls. Trails are easy to maneuver. You are rewarded with great pictures but be prepared to encounter a lot of tourists.The Athabasca falls are a 5-8 min drive from most hotels in Jasper. There is a nice walking trail around the falls. The falls\"Although this waterfall will not qualify as world class in height & width, the sheer power of the Athabasca River narrowing & flowing through this narrow chasm is awesome especially as seen right from the brink. It is a must see when traveling the Icefields Parkway.\"\"This was a surprising, delightful site. It was very accessible and well planned. We could have stayed much longer, just admiring the view.\"About 20 kilometers out of Jasper on the Icefields Parkway. Relatively easy walk with nice views of the falls from different angles.On the trip to view the Canadian Rockies. Lovely fall but not the best. Niagara Falls is the clear winner. The plus side: Weather is good. Not so crowded. Facilities are very clean.Definitely have your camera ready. The falls are beautiful. Definitely take the short hike to the bottom too. Scenery is amazing and the colour of the water is stunning. Only 30kms from Jasper too.\"We stopped at these falls on ur way from Banff to Jasper, and so glad we did. The scenery and falls our outstanding. its an easy walk, a lot of information written at viewpoints, and again easy free parking. Dont firget your camera!!\"\"There are two points to travel to: the lower and upper falls. Both are doable, however you do need to be able to hike to especially get to the upper one. Lots of people were there as we visited on a public holiday. Some posing Chipmunks on the way up - added to the enjoyment. make sure you go into the cave on the first fall. Some paths are narrow, especially when busy and quite wet in places.\"Lots of good vantage points. (some rainbows in cascade ). Easy walk; some steps to go down/climb back to go below falls. Beautiful blue water. Rocks and foliage are very good. Pretty good site for photographers. Obey warnings to not go beyond fence. Adequate restrooms. Can get crowded.\"The Athabasca Falls are truly spectacular. The boardwalk trail which leads to the lower level of the falls is well maintained. There are quite a few stairs here but it's worth the effort. I'm no photographer but the images of the falls on my ipad are just stunning. The day we visited there was a National Parks representative on the walkway between the carpark and the Falls with pelts from local wildlife. We stopped and had a look and spoke at length with this young man who was extremely informative about local wildlife and history. We found the Park Rangers in attendance at many popular spots around Jasper and I must say I think it's a wonderful initiative! As I say, there are quite a few stairs so if you have mobility issues you may just view the Falls from the top. There are a few seats scattered around up there too.\"\"Easy access, safe and good location of the highway. Could us a bit of update and some control of runoff.\"Several nice views of the Athabasca Falls are available around the site. Lots of parking. Parts of the walkway can be slippery in the rain.The falls are a really short walk from the parking lot. In winter the frozen waterfall is amazing and it even looks good in summer. The trail to the falls is short and the viewing point picturesque. Make sure u bring a camera and a selfie stick because you are going to want to take a snap.\"Called in near the end of our road trip to Jasper. Parking was good and some basic toilets on the site . Well signed information boards informative and helpful . The falls were in full flow so worth the stop . We were surprised that it was quite busy , we stayed about 30 mins as we were dropping off our hire car in Jasper .\"\"We enjoyed stopping by the Falls, walking through the area, & watching the power of these falls. The water is beautiful & the rock formations formed by the water are awesome.\"Stopped here whilst driving the Icefields Parkway to Jasper.The falls are just off the main highway and well signposted. There is a large free car park.You approach the falls by heading towards the river and then follow hard surfaced paths alongside the falls down several levels as far as the river if you wish.A lovely natural wonder well worth visiting.A must do... Ale walk around for great views... Not too hard to walk around... About 1 hours to go around if you don't stop too much for pictures...It took us 1 1/2 hours... Very nice ...Another spectacular work of nature. A nice easy trail to get multiple views of the wonders of the world at it's best. Totally awe inspiring. Definitely worth a side trip.\"Definitely stop and enjoy this spectacular sight of Mother Nature, you will not be disappointed. Lots of viewing points to enjoy Falls,\"When we visited there was quite a lot of water going over the falls so they looked at there best probably. Well constructed walkways means that you can get up close to see the force of the falls.A good stop off point half way between Lake Louise and Jasper.\"The Athabasca falls are pretty incredible. Take the time to learn the history of the falls and it makes them even more appreciated. The gorge which has formed is amazing, the walking paths have made viewing this treasure very accessible for everyone. Great place stop in your travels and spend some time admiring the power of these falls and what they have created. There is nice picnic areas and facilities.\"Always spectacular! Enjoyable as always only thing there were places hard to get a gòd view to busload of tourists with their self sticks and cameras but I quess that is one of the challenge of a high tourist spot. Just wish they could have been more considerate instead of blocking and pushing. Oh well! Sigh. Well worth seeing or showing someone who has never seen it. It is always beautiful.Incredible! Make sure to stop at these magnificent falls. Take time to view it from all the various view points.This is one of the must see places on the Icefield Parkway... worth a visit on a road trip to Jasper. Its awesome.But... it is a heavily managed tourist hot spot... If you want something a little bit less beaten track then go further along the 93 to Mistaya Canyon...I love waterfalls & this one should not be missed. Very conveniently located right off the Icefields Parkway.You'll need at least 30 to 45 minutes to take in all of the paths to see both the top and the bottom of these magnificent falls. The rock strata made visible by the water cut is worth a close look. It's a 'must do' in Jasper National Park.Stunning. PMake a great picture post card. The falls were in full flight with the melting snow. The roaring of the water over the falls could be heard for miles. The falls. Drop off in a number of places along the canyon until it drops down into a wider part of the river. Well worth hiking along the trails beside the falls.\"I try to review places with an eye for those less-abled, I feel there's not enough info sometimes. You can see a lot of the upper falls via accessible trails, but for the lower falls and the lake, you need to be fairly fit. This is a place worth stopping!! Plenty of washrooms, parking may be an issue during high season (May & Sept are shoulder season). I suggest to do the stairs/light short hike to the beach, if you're able, the views are breathtaking\"Athabasca Falls is located within Jasper National Park on the upper Athabasca River just south of Jasper on the Icefield Highway. Allow at least one hour here as the scenery is gorgeous & there are plenty of opportunities to take some inspiring landscape photo's. The Athabasca Falls is a waterfall where the Athabasca River funnels into a wild running gorge just metres from the car park. There is a timber boardwalk which meanders along the gorge & a path which goes deeper into the canyon. There is ample parking available & toilet's. A great place to spot to stretch the legs if driving along the Icefield Highway.On the road between Jasper and Lake Louise and every tour operator will stop here and for a very good reason. Everyone likes a good waterfall.\"What a magnificent view of nature at its most powerful, tonnes of water cascading over the rocks , the noise water spray all combine to give you a wow feeling\"The falls were spectacular. It is worth spending around 30 mins here. Many scenic pictures to be taken here. Be careful not to cross the barriers/edges though.\"Super view of the falls and you can walk down to the canyon bottom, which isn't all that far. Mostly paved so suitable for all. Drop toilets in the car park, bit smelly but ok. Worth a stop on your journey.\"Very beautiful place to visit and just off the hifgway making it easy to get to but very busy as well...\"Those athabasca waterfalls are very nice, and it comes on the icefield parkway, about 40 km outside jasper.Ther are 2 falls that comes together and nice lake and canyon down to them.Its a nice break on 93 highway, and place to see.\"Allot of fun for the family. it was a nice small hike with great views. If you are an outdoors type person it is worth the small walk.The falls are only a short distance walk from the car and bus parking area and are well worth taking the 20 minutes to walk there and back and see how all the melt water from the Athabasca River falls into a very steep but short chasm.Lovely clean place to visit. Beautifull views of the falls. An easy walk with steps to the falls. Beautifull example of washing machine whirling pool.The sound from these falls are fearsome and at least 2 young men have died by not keeping to the designated path.Athabasca is a stunning display of the power of water as it rushes through narrow channels. It is a short walk from the parking lot with easy access to various viewing vantage points. We found time to make 2 trips during our stay at Jasper.\"Don't miss this! If you're into photography, you'll be rewarded. And even if you're not into photography, the site is breathtaking!\"\"A must see on your travels to Jasper National Park. Could get quite busy on a nice day, but well worth the visit.\"Loads to see. Easy walking and interesting information about the history of the falls. Walked up river through the woods and back down past the falls. All accessibleI'm used to backcountry hiking. Seen better falls. It's easy access by car and worth the get a quick photo taken. Then off for coffee or fight the crowed.Well worth the stop. There are multiple view points and many information boards. We were there late in the afternoon in May. It could get real crowded in the high season.Well worth the stop as the falls were nice. It was a short walk to the falls and we walked down to the area below the falls which was worth doing. All in all it was a nice place to get out and stretch.\"It's not just the Falls but the deep and incredibly narrow canyon below the falls. The river had cut a canyon but unusually the hard rock won out and eventually it overflowed, redirected and cut the deep canyon which can be seen today. This is presumably because of the spring floods with glacial melt water (millions of years ago?). A rare example of rock beats water. You can walk the old canyon too. Another amazing fact is the fish above and below the falls which is way too high to be passed. Presumable early First Nations introduced some trout above the falls for ease of fishing and to spread the valuable food source. An example of early farming?\"\"Very beautiful place, lots of hiking trails, breathtaking panorama's, fun and educative place to show natural aspects to children\"\"The water falls are incredible. It is just memorizing to see the power that water can have. A must see stop for anyone traveling to,Jasper\"'Falls' in Canada can mean anything from big rapids to actual waterfalls. This is thankfully the later and is quite impressive. Nice walk round and over the falls.We stopped here on the way back to Jasper from the Columbia Ice Fields. Really interesting stop and the falls were gorgeous. Well worth the brief detour!The wide Athabasca River becomes a funnel and just powers thru the falls in 3 different levels. Awesome power. Great to see where nature has chosen different paths over time. It makes you realise that these features have been around for a very long time. Easy walking to all levels although there are some steps to the lower level.\"The walk to and bridges across the falls offer a great view (and photo op) of the river, falls and canyon. Highly worthwhile stop if traveling in this area as the walk to the falls is less than 5 min from the car park. A slightly longer walk takes you to the bottom of the canyon thru which the falls have cut.\"This is about 40 mins towards jasper from banff. very beautiful. Good for a quick stop and stretch off the legsStopped to see the falls and they did not disappoint. They were loud and pretty. Can do quite quickly and plenty of photo ops.\"What a great place.

Spent at least an hour just walking around and taking in the beauty of the river and the views.\"Athabasca falls is a 45 minute drive from the town of Jasper National Park, west of Icefield Parkway.

Would love to bring the kids back.\"We visited the falls on a rainy, cloudy, day, but it didn't detract from the experience. The falls are not particularly high or wide, but are still beautiful. Parks Canada have done an excellent job of placing viewing platforms and walk ways to give excellent views, and there are informative signs dotted around. The falls are a must see if you visit Jasper, whatever the weather.\"\"A really well set out trek around the falls with lots of informative notices telling you all about the falls and its surroundings.

We were there around noon. The guy we bought sandwiches from promised us there wouldn't be lots of people there, but there like 12 tour buses of high school kids there. The parking lot was nice. The water fell off of the rocks. It was a little loud. Lots of smokers, which made the smell of the falls a lot less enjoyable.Not wheelchair accessible.\"\"We almost passed by this assuming it was just another water fall. However, the way it has cut into the rock makes it interesting and a special stop.\"\"If you going to Jasper, make sure you visit this place. It's a little less than an hour drive from downtown. If you see wildlife along the way, it's a bonus.When you get to the parking area, there were multiple Washrooms and picnic tables.A little walk to the falls, lot's stairs and rails. Be careful on some tight spots of the area.Wonderful views from different locations. Very relaxing.\"\"We went early in the morning before the tour buses arrived and it felt like we were the only ones on earth. Beautiful views from every angle, quiet, listened to the birds and rushing water together; harmony in nature. This is worth the stop. Go EARLY.\"\"good accessibility, stairs to most levels, protective rails, toilets were in good shape, it was still frozen when I went and water volume low in early spring but still a must see.\"A great place to hike and walk through dry canyons and go to the bottom and build with rocks. Don't forget your camera but stay behind the fences as some have not and are no longer around to tell the tale of it's grandure july 2013Not far from the main road this river and falls make an impressive scenery with beautiful views of background mountains. Water falls in different places in different angles making it beautiful to watch from different places. The area is well constructed allowing people to cross the river to the other side to see the fall in different angle. A must see attraction in the area.Athabasca Falls is one of the sights you have to see if you are in the Jasper area. Every time I visit Jasper (which has been a lot!) I have stopped here. The falls are rushing and quite impressive. Mount Kerkeslin acts as the amazing backdrop to the falls adding even more awe. The bridge and paths are located very close to the waterfall providing great vantage points for viewing.\"Walked through the path to see how the giant potholes were formed, the water looking so beautiful from were to fell heavily and to the stream right after the canyon were it was calm. Beautiful experience\"Just happened upon these falls. They are probably one of he nicest falls I have ever seen. Well kept area. Many viewing areas. Spectacular with mountains in the background.First time in Alberta and had to go and see these falls it was a bit of a hike as we were staying in Radium Hot Springs BC (5 hours away). We decided to do an overnight to Jasper National Park and were really excited to get to see these Falls. The color of the water is so unique (blue/green) and really clear. There are plenty of signs explaining the history and geographically content of the Falls. No very crowded when we were there as there was still ice and snow on some of the trails (many were closed still from winter). Plan to spend at least an hour with lots of picture taking opportunities.\"The first time I traveled to Jasper park was in the summer, the water was raging and the falls were breathtaking .. and I am from Alaska, so it takes a lot to impress me! .. I have been there in Fall and also early spring. During the early spring trip the water was frozen, therefore leaving Malign Canyon dry! .. Which was also very cool, because you can climb into it in some locations and get a different perspective on how deep it really is. Also, spring time is less crowded as i only ran into one other person on the entire hike!\"\"When you are surrounded by spectacular nature, what is another gem? Great 15 minute trip out from the Jasper townsite, you pass stunning vistas to get to Athabasca falls. It is amazing to see how water has carved rock over the years. Climb down the path to the lower viewing area to see the beautiful green water on the other side of the falls.\"Hiked around Athabasca Falls and admired the scenery. The falls are great example of nature's handiwork over the thousands of years. A nice easy walk for those not wanting something too challenging.\"The falls are a short walk from the carpark which is usually full of tourist buses so go early.Watching the force of the falls thunder into the canyon is amazing, but stay on the trails as it is very slippery and dangerous.It is also very cold around the falls so wear warm clothes.\"\"We stopped here with our dog. It was a nice 15 minute or so drive from jasper down highway 93A very impressive drive. Once we got there there was only 4 other cars so we pretty much had the whole place to ourselves and the water was really slowing even tho it was quite chilly out, always worth a visit anyway\"Easy walk to falls and the mountains all around it...the sound of water falling down gives you peace....it was just wonderful placeOur family visited here to show my mother-in-law the falls. I had special ice grippers for our shoes which had been very handy during past winter excursions but they were practically unnecessary at the end of March.

Easy walk.\"Beautiful scenery. Short walk from parking area. Easy drive, well marked directions. Would recommend.\"One of my Favorite quick visits when in Jasper. The falls can be spectacular in the spring. A must see!!\"I suspect the seasons can make for different experiences here but this is a simples stop for a bathroom break and a stretch with a view. It's 90 seconds to walk to the falls form the lot. The falls are basic and not great viewing despite considerable view points being built out. It's just the nature of the falls, they are hard to get a great view. It could be that the walk down the canyon is ok, but it was closed. The cramped space and all the people and the lack of exciting falls and lack of great views made this a total bust for me. I can barely recommend it except for maybe people, with kids. Young kids.\"Have been to many falls - bigger and much more vicious. Something about this one just blew me away. Got there just before the snow had melted completely so was not in full force yet the water was quite powerful and very green. A must visit. Not very busy when we went there so we had most of the falls to ourselves. What a treat.Wonderful place to visit. A little tricky in the spring as part of the path down to the lake was closed due to ice.\"I have been to many waterfalls and athabasca falls to me is average and mediocre. The falls themselfs are only around 60 feet high and partially obstructed by the rock canyon, there always seems to be lots of people at these falls so there is a lot of bumping shoulders. The nature walk down to the river is nice.\"This is well worth the trip to make the visit. Lots of different views of the falls and many panel boards discussing various factual tidbits on how they were formed.\"Decided this would be a great stop to have a snack and stretch our legs. Traveling with a teen, pre teen, and a five year old. This area was easily accessible. It was gorgeous, between the frozen parts of the falls and blue colors of the water it made for great pictures.\"We had a look here one day. Beautiful. Some people do white water rafting here-probably more for professionals!!\"Great views and times as always.

Right off the highway, lots of parking and amazing blue green water pours from the falls!\"\"we were last here in 1981 on our honeymoon and thought it was closer to town! but the drive was lovely. we had to park on the road because the parking lot was closed (not maintained during the winter season) and the walk was a little sketchy because of the ice, but very worth the time. there are lots of interpretive signs and view points. definitely worth the drive.\"\"I love these falls! There's a nice easy walk around and it's absolutely beautiful (as is anywhere in the Rockies). Bring your camera, but make sure you have time to just sit and enjoy nature.\"The falls were mostly frozen and looked beautiful. The bridge lookout gave us a very close view and an excellent spot for photos.\"I have been to these falls a few times over the years, but never in the winter. They are incredibly beautiful when frozen. So many shades of blue! Make sure to wear proper footwear, as the path can be slippery in spots.\"This hike can easily be done in 30min with children. The parking near the edge of the falls were you can experience the might of the Athabasca River. From there you follow an old dry canyon to the bottom of the falls.I love this place. I have stopped in several times on the drive between Banff and Jasper. If you get the chance it is absolutely amazing to see in the winter time\"In the winter the Athabasca Falls are frozen and they look wonderful with the water flowing underneath, the colours are amazing.\"\"Went here in fall while touring around Jasper. Worth the drive out to the falls - great walk around the falls and the river. Informative signage, plenty of parking and accessible to kids.\"Beautiful. One of the most magnificent works of mother nature that you'll ever see in your life. Set aside an hour or 2 to check out this site.\"We went there on a warm winter afternoon. We were the only people there. We've been there in the summer, which is impressive, but the winter is beautiful. The falls are frozen except a small amount of water under the ice. It's beautiful.\"The falls are a great attraction to visit while in the Jasper area. My recommendation would be to come during off-season or at the very least to see the falls earlier in the day as they get incredibly busy later in the afternoon. Also make sure you bring suitable footwear as the paths can be wet and muddy.Stunning in the winter! Such a beautiful sight to see! Although it can be a little dangerous walking around as all the paths were covered with ice. Definitely worth the beautiful drive from Jasper!The roaring and the mist of the falls gave us refreshing feeling after a long way drive through Icefield Parkway from Lake Louise.\"Beautiful falls surrounded by carved rocks, forest, and mountains. The sprays from the waterfall will form rainbows on a sunny day. It is a easy walk around with lots of beauty to admire.\"\"Absolutely loved our hike here! Bring your camera and take your time. So much beauty to enjoy. We went without a map, and tried looking online for it part way through, to find spotty service haha. TIP: grab a map before you go so you can estimate how long the route you are on will take if you cant just meander your way through. Also, dress in layers, most areas are shaded\"Take a half an hour or half a day to explore these beautiful Falls. An easy walk to get up close and personal.\"Visited here with a tour group. The falls are not far to walk from the car park.While not tall , they are very powerful with a massive amount of water surging through. Well worth a look.\"I love this place!

Absolutely recommend this stop!\"Breath taking beauty, nice trails and you can choose how far you wish to walk. Bridal falls are great for picture taking.\"I could visit this place everyday and never get tired of the scenery. Clean area as well so its a great place to spend time.\"The Athabasca Falls are not very large, nor have a great height, but are very picturesque and the white foaming waters and the deep, narrow canyon after the falls offer great photo opportunities. You can cross over to the other side of the falls by the pedestrian bridge across the canyon for a different view.\"Yet another stunning spot to stop off and take photos. The colour of the water is incredible with interesting rock formations that the water streams through.\"Went once in the fall & now in the winter, alittle icey walk in but the falls are beautiful to see with all the ice & crystal blue water. Lower trails all closed off for safety\"Stopped off at the Athabasca falls on my tour through Jasper. Visited here a few times and keep on visiting every time I do. If you haven't seen it definitely worth visiting and not much walking to see the falls and get up close and personal and feel the mist on your face.An absolutely beautiful place to visit.Easy walking paths allow you to see the both sides of the falls.Simply amazing frozen falls (tho not completely). Well worth the stop as the winter falls are stunning ice formations.\"Had a great time visiting is July. Lots of people but the Falls are worth it. Would recommend going all the way down to the outlet, beautiful caverns to walk through.\"This was my second trip to the falls in winter and it didn't seem to be as icy as it was the last time. The stairs to the lower falls was roped off with a DO NOT ENTER sign. A beautiful sight and well worth visitng\"Came across this along ice field parkway . Parking available and just a short walk to the falls lookouts. Quite cool around the falls, needed a jumper. Just an amazing view of the water rushing down and seeing the rocks worn away from the force of the water over all the years.

I really like the gushing of water on the layered kind of rocks scene. Water flow is strong during my time of visit in August. There were quite a few people around when I was there so photo taking and all will have many people in the pictures.Worth a stop if its on the way.\"Make sure you pay this a visit, It is absolutely beautiful, Those who are not sure of foot beware some of the stone and rock floors can be a tad slippy. Amazing attraction and definitley a highlight for me.\"Worth another stop just off the Ice Field Parkway. The flow of the water creates different patterns and flows. Popular with bus loads of tourists.\"This place is a rush, one of the deepest gorges we have seen. Double rainbows, extremely fast currents, artists painting\"\"I have walked on the edges of the river bed when it was very dry, so make sure there is plenty of water around to see the ferocity of the water falls, there are short walks around the area too to explore\"Athabasca Falls are directly off the parkway. There is large parking lot and bathrooms. This is a busy Tour bus stop and the starting point for rafting on the river. The falls are wildly beautiful and is a must see.stunning sight..totally loved it.we took loads of pictures.there were restrooms close by.a must visit.\"The difference in water flow between spring, fall and winter is amazing. The water never stops because of the weight and friction of an ice sheet glacier at the Columbia Ice fields. No admittance charges as long as you have the standard National Park Pass. Do not stop if you see four or more tour busses as the view points are quite small and no Parks Personnel to assist with crowd control or information. It is a thing you enjoy more with the quiet and serenity of the moment. No facilities.\"We drove out New Year's Day to take the short hike and view the falls in the winter. The water that was running was a beautiful blue and the ice formation on the falls was fantastic. Great for a short hike in the fresh air.\"I've been to the falls a number of times in the summer, and have enjoyed them every time. Last weekend we were cross country skiing on some trails in the area and stopped by the falls. They were spectacular in the winter - much prettier than the summer version, and with a fraction of the tourists!\"\"Athabasca falls is stunning. It was very busy when we visited, but definitely worth battling the crowds to see. It was very easy to get parked at the falls and a pleasant way to spend an afternoon.\"I just love this whole region. There is so much to see and it's so picturesque. I look forward to going back in winter.I am always amazed at this site. I have been here in the summer and winter and plan to return in the spring and fall.

Worth driving off your way!Easy access. Beautiful falls. Easy hike. Can be crowded at times. Worth the short drive from the highwayThe falls were spectacular and are so beautiful.

I recommend a few minutes to an hour or more to explore, relax and enjoy.\"\"One of the top 10 sights in Jasper/Banff, probably in top 5. Right by highway but allow 45-60 minutes to walk up, down, all around and really enjoy it.\"It's a bit off the beaten path. But so worth finding! It's great for old and young. Educational and picture worthy.These falls along with Sunwapta are both worthy of your time whilst touring the Icefield parkway road. In our opinion these falls just edge Sunwapta waterfalls.The erosion is more apparent and is easier to access with the walk from the car park being far from strenuous this should suit folk of most ages.Enjoy the power of water from a safe viewing platformWorth a stop to stretch your legs and witness the awesome beauty and power of nature. There are two platforms from which to see the waterfall..We like to walk along the paths and see the river and the falls. So peaceful and beautiful.

Head south on Highway 93 out of Jasper. This is parking and washrooms. Follow the trails from the parking lot south to the viewing areas beside the falls It is possible to get interesting photos of the falls and the Athabasca River\"We visited twice, once in drizzle on the way up to Jasper and then, on the way back to Banff, in much better weather. These falls are impressive and the walkways allow inspection of all levels and from different levels right down to the lower shoreline. Very crowded even in poor weather so it must really be worth seeing (it is!). Varied photo opportunities\"\"We expected to have to walk a long distance to the falls but got a pleasant surprise that it was only a 10 minutes walk and the falls, although not gigantic were pretty. Well worth a visit\"\"Natural Beauty at it's best. Spectacular views and if in the area, you have to make time to stop here. Accessible to all and a short walk from the parking lot.Please make sure to stay within the allowed walkways. Accidents can happen if not\"\"The drive in was nice and clean. The falls was beginning to freeze but still falling. The only downside is where the walk goes down to the river on the left, seems to be used as a public bathroom. Still one of natures most beautiful sights.\"One of the many must see attractions in the area .It can get quite busy when 2 or 3 tourist buses turn up together .Be careful when it rains as it can get slippy underfoot.The etched canyon walls are quite impressive as is the startling blue of the water as it rushes through. Very photogenic so take your camera\"Me and my family (wife and 1 year old) stopped here back in mid August (took awhile to get to my review lol) but this place is definitely worth a stop.. It doesn't take long to see, but there is quite a few flights of stairs which made a bit of a hassle for our stroller and can get pretty busy, best to go in the morning or evening.. But other than that it was well worth it, the roar of the falls sure is something to hear.. Also if your coming from Jasper, you should drive on 93-A, there's a couple spots along the way such as Mount Edith Cavell and a nice place to have pit stop (the last photo)\"\"Even with snow, the Falls looked breathtaking and the blue-green water was just as amazing! Bonus was the minimal number of tourists. If you do visit during winter, proper winter footwear is a must as the pathways/trails are not maintained and can be slippery.\"\"Definitely worth the stop off, could not believe how much beautiful clear water comes down these falls every second! You can walk down to the bottom too and see the river and it's a beautiful blue colour.

Impressive as always but you could expect a lot of people.the falls are awesome they are a must see when you are in the area they are very inspiring and the lake below is greatThese falls must be included in any tour of the area. They are absolutely beautiful! There is a path that runs down from the car park and along by the river crossing it by the actual falls. Don't forget the camera!\"What ever the season, every time we are in Jasper we drive out to see the falls. Never get tired of watching and listening to them.. Different site every season.\"This is a beautiful waterfall on the Athabasca River; Breathtakingly beautiful. We're from the south U.S and just don't have this kind of water. It is worth the trip to Alberta. We always thought Alaska was the most beautiful place we have visited until we travel the Canadian Rockies.\"This is a great place to get off the highway for a bit an explore. The falls are awesome. There are so many different vantage points from which to view them, it is really cool set-up to wander around. The look of them is incredibly different depending on where on the trail around them you are viewing them. And the whole are is beautiful. Definitely recommend making this stop if you are traveling around in Jasper NP.\"\"We visited after the tourist season, so there were very few people around. Mother Nature really is an amazing creator. The falls were beautiful and on different levels, so you could walk all round. The water is a stunning blue. Definitely a must see if you're in the area.\"\"Pretty surprising to me those Athabasca falls. Upon arrival, I thought we would be walking around 15 minutes and then move to the next place but we ended up spending more than 2 hours there.

Would recommend and would return.\"Travelling back from Jasper to Canmore and feeling a little overdosed on waterfalls, we decided to stop and give these a try. Not a particularly high drop but very spectacular. Make sure you take the footpath leading down from the falls which is through and old water channel down to the very placid area below the falls\"\"What can you say about nature at its most awesome? The amount of water coming down the falls was amazing and mind-boggling The force of the water has cut the rock like a razor. And yet, not too far away the thundering water enters a more peaceful river bend. The area is very scenic and beautiful even without the falls.\"What a fabulous road trip along the Icefields Parkway. Make sure you stop at the Athabasca Falls. The viewing is fabulous - well worth the stop.This was a short visit as we traveled from Banff to Jasper.

Good access for all abilities and loos.These falls are quite scenic and you can have a slow stroll or a longer walk to see the falls.

A couple of hours well spent.A short walk from the parking lot and so worth itAmazing to see the water carved out through the rocksVisited during May ling weekend and it was cold so bring a jacket for sure (there was still some snow banks along the side of the road)\"Great place to stop and stretch the legs. While it isn't Niagara falls, it is an interesting geological feature on the road between Banff and Jasper. Informational plaques tell you how it was formed and why the colour of the water is what it is.\"We did a quick stop here on the way back from the sky walk. Easily could have walked for more than a quick 30 minutes. Seems as though there was more to see. But a great picture taking opportunity - and it's free. Worth the stop!\"Gorgeous falls. A short walk from the parking lot. Came here around October, rather cold so make sure to bundle up.\"This is one of the attractions that I visit every time I come to Jasper. It is a must see for all visitors.\"Not huge but very nice landscape.

Does get a bit chilly and slippery due to spray from the water so make sure to have a good coat and shoes with good grip.\"\"Very easy to access and view. Everything is paved and most areas are both stroller and wheelchair friendly.

If you want to see some beautiful falls without hiking or bushwacking, this is it.\"Not too far from Jasper these falls are easily accessible. Not too big a fall but the walk around the river is marvelous.\"The falls and surrounding scenery are very nice and worth a stop. The main paths are asphalt and easily navigated but there are stairs.

Take the walks round and about to move away from the busier areas.Very cool falls definetly go see these! you can do the loop through to Ethel Cavel and then Athabasca falls and come right back out on the 93!\"Just another fantastic sight in the vast country that is Canada! Whilst not as dramatic as Niagara,Athabasca Falls are still spectacular and beautiful. The clear flowing waters through the mountains make the visit well worth it.\"\"The falls are wonderful - so many varied aspects, with helpful, informative but unobtrusive signs. Car parking excellent. Pity about all the people taking 'selfies' - they probably missed out on the superb scenery!\"\"My friends and I recently made a road trip along the Canadian Rockies. We love hiking and this falls along with other lakes and other natural wonders, was part of our itinerary. So if you find yourself in the vicinity, find time to see Athabasca Falls.\"\"busy spot, great sight to see but, hard to get good pictures. Show up early and beat the larger groups. It is worth the trip but, be ready.\"\"A beautiful spot to visit as a family.. easy to get to, not strenuous and yet you get to witness some of Canada's most beautiful natural resources.. rock formations, gushing water etc. etc. Just a nice place to take a stroll.\"Stopped here between jasper and Banff to view the falls and mountains beyond. As with all attractions it was busy with coach tours. We travelled on quiet 93A.\"One of the must stops on the Icefield Parkway, the falls are powerful and considering that they are melting from the glacier, give the place a cool air.

There is no other activity that compares to the natural beauty that Jasper National Park has to offer.\"\"Easy access to a beautiful site. Good info. panels. Cross the bridge for different viewpoints. Lots of tourists, plan accordingly.\"Athabasca Falls is a short 2 minute drive from Highway 93. It truly is a spectacular natural site.

The paths around the falls are easy to navigate even for those not so sprightly and it is a well worth visit if you are in the jasper Park area. Many points to take photographs and the area is well narrated. Note the area is closed to public in the winter. Access is part of the Park pass you get when you enter the area.\"Pretty waterfall with nice signs that give information about the waterfall and wildlife. Nice walk around the waterfall.The Athabasca Falls were a powerful waterfall with the path of the water winding through rock formations that were striking and beautiful.The walk to the water was easy and there were several places to stop and look at different views of the falls. One of the best waterfalls we stopped at during our drive on the Columbia Parkway. This one is worth the stop and the walk.\"Great photo opportunity. Lovely waterfall, fast moving water. A bench in memory of a young man was a sobering reminder that it was dangerous to go out onto the rocks. Fascinating to walk down an old waterfall route, you see how the water course has changed.\"\"If you go on a beautiful sunny day, you will get some amazing photos. The canyons are so deep and the volume of water is amazing. Worth a pit-stop\"\"it's just falls but you can feel very nice icy falls.you should go there to see the rocky falls.\"We stopped there on the way to High Level. The falls were absolutely beautiful.

ITs a must stop location on the road from Jasper to Banff\"\"Beautful falls, short walk to get there. Definitely a don't miss .

Excellent for photos.\"Athabasca Falls - beautiful little walk to stretch you legs and take in the beauty. The beautiful color is amazing.Amazing water color and nice to walk around and see nature at its best. It is worth stopping here for photos.Really recommendable to stop here on your way on highway 93 from Jasper to Banff. The water is really blue and looks dramatic bubbling down the falls. Just take a look!\"We were on a tour, and this was one of the stops along the way from Banff to Jasper.Athabasca Falls a very powerful waterfall, due to the large quantity of water falling into the gorge. What was most interesting was that the force was so strong that it basically produced a diamond-like drill on the rocks. We were a bit surprised that it was still this strong, even though it's mid-September (we've had drought for 10 years in Los Angeles area, and even some falls are fairly dry by this time of the year).Photos, hopefully in order, show the gradual increase of water and the buildup.\"\"This is a spectacular stop, not to be missed. If you are traveling from Banff to Jasper be sure you see this!\"Very popular spectacular waterfalls. Informative boards. Interesting rock formations carved out by the rushing water over thousands of years.Incrediable scenery around the Jasper area . Some much to see and do. The falls are a wonder of nature. A must to be seen while traveling the Canadian Rockies.The first falls that we saw on the start of our Icefield Parkway trip. We were suitably impressed and suggest they must be included on such a trip.\"Very approachable attraction from the road. Probably the biggest waterfall along the Icefields Parkway, so stop for a look and a stretch! And even in a light rain - you will get some spray from the falls anyway, so what's the difference?\"\"I do not have the vocab nor the flourish writing skills to do justice to this place. Not each turning, no way guys, here it was a case of each step that had the 'oh my god', yep, even for the atheists 'oh my god' would be a tad understatement.\"\"Worth seeing but if short of time skip it and go to Edith Cavell Trail, Maligne Lake, Peyto lake, Moraine Lake. It is interesting but not particularly beautiful. Victoria Falls and Niagara are much more impressive.\"\"Beautiful place to visit, take a walk around the falls and take some wonderful photos in a lovely peaceful location. I enjoyed the time I was there.\"\"We enjoyed the falls. For us, there was lots of walking. for younger folks, it was easy. The falls were beautiful and the potholes were fun to see.\"\"This is a \"\"must see\"\" when in Jasper. Located just off the Jasper/Banff Parkway, you don't want to miss this example of natural power. You are able to walk along and across the Athabasca River to get up close and personal with this huge volume of Glacial water. Starting at the Columbia Ice fields, this water is making its way to Lake Athabasca before reaching its ultimate destination of the Arctic Ocean.\"Very accessible from the highway. Watch for signs and be sure to pull off for this natural attraction...it is beautifulThis is a great exciting Falls to visit. Take a walk around the falls to appreciate the views. Wonderful photo opportunites for all. not far far Jasper; great to visit if one is travelling to lake Louise. Must see.\"We stopped by Athabasca Falls while we were heading to Jasper.

This is just simply breathtaking. Took so many pictures. You have to be here to enjoy its beauty. We stopped at the Athabasca Falls Viewpoint where we were treated to an amazing view. Loved it!\"\"Monolithic rock formations have obviously been carved by eons of water cascading over them, eddies swirling glacial minerals against them like sculptors’ tools. Spectacular views from a bridge crossing the river made me long for the opportunity to hike the trail that lead to the bottom, where kayakers gather to shoot the rapids. There are several viewpoints around the falls, all of them phenomenal. This is a must-see for anyone driving along Icefields Parkway. Though not within Jasper city limits, this attraction is the top rated one for the Jasper area—for good reason. It’s spectacular.\"\"Shows the power of water.Spectacular amounts of water falling, through narrow channels, flowing out into a wide calm river.\"\"Athabasca Falls are ranked Number 1 attraction in Jasper for many reasons. They are accessible, impressive and well-interpreted (highly educational). One can feel the power of the water, touch the colourful rock formation, and taste the mist of the river.This is a must stop along the Icefields Parkway. Plan to spend at least 2 hours here to benefit from all the information on the interpretation or education signage.When we got to the bottom of the falls, some kayakers were getting ready to have some fun in the rapids downstream.\"Amazing to see and experience. We loved the visit and it was just beautiful and powerful to see these falls. Easy to get to as well\"Great falls to see, short walk from car park. do walk down to view river as wonderful view. good photo oportunity\"Short time line needed to visit this attraction. Very busy in the summer.

Fantastic views of the canyons and beautiful river and falls.\"Stunning location with breathtaking views. The falls are beautiful, the paths are great and well set up. Its easily accessible and good for people all ages. The paved trails are well done and organized; great place for picnic or to spend a day.\"I visited this falls in September on tour. This is most beautiful place I have visited Easy to reach .the fall is so beautiful and very calming place to just seat and admire scenery The river plunges through a narrow gorge .Would highly recommend. Go early and enjoy place when less crowded.Allow plenty of time to take in this superb place.Worth a look. Not known for the height of the falls but experience the power and thunder of the falls up close from one of the viewing spots.Great scenery. The falls are amazing and the information boards are very good also. Great photo opportunities here.Great place to do whitewater rafting.Marilyn Monroe did a movie here. They built the road we take down to the river for her movie.Short walk from the car park. Easy to get too. Even in the middle of a drought the falls were spectacular. Worth the trip if you are in the area.A short way off the highway and well worth the visit.The river plunges through a narrow George creating spectacular eddy carvings in the rock walls.The access to view the falls is well planned and allows for excellent photo opportunities.Take care because the spray can get on your lenses and the footpath is wet and slippery in places.Overall a fine spectacle.The falls are well worth going in to check out. Lots of free parking and paved trails leading to several lookout points.\"Great day - seen some very picturesque countryside and did not have to do the driving, parking the car etc. I used both Banff and Jasper as my places of stay for a week while exploring all the surrounding country and sights. There is a much larger choice of good accommodation and places to eat in Banff than in Jasper as it is a much larger town.The day trip included Johnson's Canyon, Lakes Liouse and Moraine (very beautiful), and then up to the railway spiral tunnels and on to the Athabasca Falls. The best lake trip to do from Jasper is to Lake Maligne via the Maligne Canyon. This includes a cruise to the other end of the lake where you can get off and take great photos of the famous scenery encompassing Spirit Island, the lake, and the surrounding mountains. You see it in nearly every scene calendar of the Canadian Rockies. But you have to see it for yourself to take in the real beauty of that part of our planet.For the person who doesn't mind a bit of exercise, take the Jasper Tramway to the top of Whistler Mountain and then hike to the top. You will need good boots and a warm jacket as there is always a bit of snow up there. The views from the top are most rewarding.\"My wife and I were in Jasper National Park in August of 2015 and we were fortunate to see Athabaska Falls before the smoke came into the park from Eastern Washington. We thoroughly enjoyed the view and the trail to the falls. The entire Icefield's Parkway was beautiful and this was a nice place to stop and get out and take a nice walk to the Falls. Stopping is well worth the time!Bruce and Janet B.Impressive waterfalls which are easily accessible. We took the path that runs alongside the falls and returned on the upper path. Wonderful scenery!!!\"Powerful and dramatic falls really loud water at times. Not a huge place to walk around, its all free too.\"We went from Jasper and did not know what to expect ....but wow oh wow is all I can say ! You get a surprise when you get to the bridge to actually get a glimpse of what is in store...an amazing sight...do walk over the bridge and see the canyon and the flow of water ...coming from The Columbia Icefields which we were to visit the following day.We really loved it. An amazing sight.Beautiful place...the falls are magnificent as they plunge down the canyon. Be sure to visit this beautiful place.Like many people I have visited many sets of waterfalls in many far flung lands over the years. These however are special - you get up close and the glacier 'flour' makes the water a beautiful blue. Well worth a visit.\"Although we saw a lot of deep river canyons, with gorges and whirl pools, this was still worth visiting and had its own attractions. We all enjoyed our trip there and again wondered at what water under pressure can do\"Well worth the hour it will take to walk around the falls. Easy stop with good parking and no climbing or chamber in.Excellent stop and worth the visit. Spectacular falls with breattaking Rockies backdrop.Dull when we called in the morning but sunlit in the evening on our return which showed it and its backdrop in all their glory.\"Driving to Lake Louise from Jasper, a stop at Athabasca Falls is well worth it. Only draw back was the large number of large tour buses. The falls are amazing and beautiful, when all of the \"\"selfie\"\" takers finish and leave. It is recommended that paths and trails are adhered to. Not a place for solace.\"\"When you step out of the car, you can tell why this is a popular tourist stop along the Icefields Highway. You can hear the thunder of the falls, but also take in the very tangible surroundings - the trees, the plant life, even the birds and other animals that make the area their home. I visited in late September 2015 and lucked out by having beautiful sunny weather. Still, there was ice on the bridge overlooking the falls, so be careful and be aware. But for picture takers, this place will not disappoint. When you look up, you will be inspired by the mountains in the backdrop. The water was a turquoise and obviously quite cold. The bathrooms were \"\"national park\"\" style and could have been much cleaner, but that is a comment on some of the people who use them - makes one wonder. A worthwhile stop along your route and it's not too far from Jasper.\"\"Wow, incredible power. We rafted the Athabasca earlier and then went and saw the falls which really makes you appreciate this river and the fact that we got off it when we did with the guide.\"\"Very powerful waterfall and a great spot to stop when driving from Banff to Jasper, or the other way around. There’s an easy walking trail that leads to the falls. As with all the other beautiful sights that are easy accessible, there are lots of tourists.\"\"This waterfall, and the drive through Jasper national park are awe inspiring. You can get beautiful pictures at the falls. It is a quick and easy stop.\"This was an easy walk down to the falls.It's a bit more strenuous if you walk down the canyon to the river below. There are a few signs with info to read and all walkways are paved. A sight not to be missed in the Jasper area!I've attached a photo of our son at the bottom of the canyon walk dipping his toe in the Athabasca river.Athabasca Falls were superb! Got some really nice pictures. We prefer touristy destinations compared to secluded places and this had a good number of tourists. Thoroughly enjoyed it. Had washrooms and big parking lot.A nice place to visit and see the immense power of the falls. We walked around the boardwalks and had a break from the drive back from Jasper.\"A beautiful spot, worth the stop. Walk further down so you can take pictures from a different angle.\"\"Great stop on the way to Banff from Jasper! Easy walking trail, perfect for taking your old fragile parents to stretch their knees out!\"So pretty and we'll worth a stop here even if for a short while if your just passing by on your way to or from JasperHeading south along the Icefield Highway this is a left turn and not that well marked. Once back to the parking lot you can see that this is a major stop with lots of car and bus parking. Plan on spending about a half hour walking around and over the bridge to see to get a better view of the falls. Take the time to read the various signs and be patient with the many tourists all trying to get photos.Just off the main road - 1 minute off. Worth the stop it very pretty. Water super blue like in the photo.A short walk takes you to these amazing falls well worth the stop. It was -3 when we visited so wrap up also slippy under foot.\"This is a fantastic spot, simply a must see. We went and it was a damp rainy day. It wasnt a bad walk in the rain. It was simply stunning.\"A beautiful falls set amongst many beautiful spots on the Jasper to Banff drive. Easy walking and many beautiful opportunities for photos. I was fortunate to visit on a sunny day.It takes a couple of hours to look around everything there is to see. Its possible to get quite close to the falls and the power of the water is breathtaking.\"Beautiful falls and great scenery all around. Easy walk, but can get crowded at times. Allow plenty of time to just take in all the scenery.\"\"Really interesting falls, Even though we stopped by in September, there was a huge amount of water roaring down the falls. Well worth a stop.\"Nice place to while away an hour or two. Nice photographic opportunities. On the tourist bus run so be prepared for crowds. Launching spot for the river canoe trips.Its close to the main road and not far to go and it realy is amazing. And you can do it even when the weather is not so favorable.\"Nice waterfalls, on a short distamce of Jasper. Bit crowded, but nice little easy walk around and worth visiting.\"You can take the short walk down to the falls and stand on the viewing areas and see the immense amount of water churning and falling over the falls. It's stunning. You can also follow the trail and see the water and beautiful forest further down - it's very nice.Beautifull scenery and great walking path to falls. Another of natures wonders to see along the way through Jasper parkwayWell worth the trip. It is an easy walk. Parking is a problem after 1000 am. Many nice photo ops. I highly recommend a visit.It's just on the roadside so imagine how popular it can be - compared to those spots way off the 93 pkwy. It has good spots to take stunning photos but get prepared for the crowds especially when tour buses come. It's not a huge fall but definitely worth a stop.\"Such a lovely place to visit the falls are lovely and we enjoyed walking around the park with our guide we arranged a tour with Sundog Tours it was fabulous the guide walked us through and told us the history of the area highly recommend a tour to these falls, we took some great photo's.\"\"Great place to visit, it has some great views and places to walk. If you like to take pictures this is one of the best landmarks you can find.\"\"These falls are well worth stopping to see and are just a short walk from the parking lot. Another popular spot along the Icefields Parkway so can get quite busy. There is a nice pathway that is a easy hike and gives you a number of different views of the both the falls and the mountains behind them. Although they are not the highest falls, there is a vast amount of water shooting through the gorge which is very impressive. Despite what a previous reviewer stated, there are bathroom facilities near the parking lot.\"\"Worth a stop for this moderate, but interesting waterfall south of Jasper. Parks Canada has excellent interpretive signage and paths. Short walk from the parking area on paved paths.\"\"Wonderful groomed trails,I always go back, the views are spectacular! many choices of trails to take I love the rock stairs between the wall of rocks\"stunning scenery the falls are fabulous and not too long a walk off the road to see them. No place to have a drink or toilet on site\"Beautiful site with a nice cozy restaurant in the vicinity on the highway. The Falls are so unique and beautiful. Worth a visit, lots of parking and nice walk in the area.\"\"We stopped here because we were staying in a nearby campsite. At first glance, I thought it might just be a boring little touristy stop. But there are actually several different pathways to explore. My 4 year son loved it. Make sure you stay on the path, and take warnings seriously. One slip into the river, and you will not come back!! We would come here again forsure, our next trip to jasper.\"\"The falls made a good stop on the Icefields Parkway; it is just about the northernmost point of interest on the parkway and is close to Jasper townsite. We were there in September, but I expect that people who visit in the spring and early summer would be much more impressed because the water flow would be higher.\"\"Stunning display of the power of water. The falls are well worth a visit. This is a very managed site, with paved paths, guard rails and lots of other visitors.\"\"Easy access to this great natural nature valley. Beautiful place to see. Took lots of pictures, very peaceful.\"A lovely set of cascading falls...one of our favorite stops on a long day of park and attraction visits.\"Wonderful attraction, beautiful falls and surrounding scenery. The falls run into lovely blue/ turquoise water dependent upon the amount of sunshine and rock flour in the water\"They're soo beautiful but very touristic. It's just to stop by and enjoy the falls for an hour or so. You can sit down and just enjoy the scenery. Wonderful!We nearly drove past this turning at the end of a long day on the road which had included many stops to see lots of other spectacular sights. Definitely glad we made changed our mind and made the trip to see these falls. They were awesome.We stopped here on our way to Jasper and so glad we did. The Falls were fabulous and we stayed a while just staring at the moving water.\"Went here on a rainy day but the place was packed. There were school groups and bus loads of people. The falls were very interesting and worth the trip. Of note, was the way the falls cascaded through the cliffs, making a very interesting site. Again, going through the rain probably dampened the effect but is well worth the trip.\"A stunning display of nature's forces at their best. Probably best to visit early in the day or later in the day as it does get busy! Although their are restrooms at the site there are no other facilities so take a picnic and a beverage.\"So beautiful and defiantly with a stop as driving by! Just a minute or so off the hi-way and 200 meters walk from the parking. You will get to see some beauty that will take your breath away! As Nike says \"\"just do it\"\"\"A must visit when visiting jasper!enjoyed every minute of the hike.its a one way hike so plan accordingly.the hiking trail is moderately steep but made easy because of the stairs which might get slippery in rain.lots of small springs also on the way between the 5th and 6th bridge very interesting!\"The falls are a must see in the area, they are spectacular and fairly easily accessible although there are a lot of stairs down to the lower area.\"\"The glacial rivers and lakes are absolutely stunning in both Jasper and Banff Parks, with each one just bit different than another. This one has rushing water and is wider than Maligne Canyon.\"I like waterfalls and this one is loud and amazing to experience I was on a bus tour so very little time to explore But if an independent traveller take your time to appreciate this wonder of nature\"The Athabasca Falls are just a short stroll from the parking lot and very easy to reach. The falls are very beautiful, but I found that the concrete paths and railings took away from the experience, although I understand that these are safety measures.\"Good parking Easy walk through trees to the falls. Several great views of the falls from the well defined pathway. The boiling waters of the river plunge into a chasm gouged out of the valley floor. Quite spectacular. Amazing watching the power of the water and looking at the various colours and patterns in the layers of rock as we walked down a path cut through the rock to a lower vantage point. The various rock formations created by the water are really interesting and quite incredible. Great opportunity for some fantastic photos here.Well worth a stop.\"Worth seeing if you are visiting Jasper. Amazing view, fantastic spot to take pictures. It can get crowded during peak season but there's plenty of space to walk around\"Pathways are well thought out and allow visitors to see the falls from all angles. 30 minutes is plenty of time to see everything. Well worth a stop\"Well worth the drive. Only 30 km outside of Jasper, definitely will not regret it. Stay on the paths!!!\"The falls are easy to see and a short walk from the parking lot. Canada parks have latrine style toilets so beware.A great place to get close to waterfalls and experience the rush and thrill of the power of nature. Easy access from highway. Very popular place for tourists to go toGreat views of how water can erode rock in beautiful curves. The water is a wonderful color and the rock formations interesting.

Love it and will definitely going back to Jasper just to see this awesome place.\"wonderful for pictures or videos, make sure you record some sound to go with your videos. The roar of the falls can be heard before you leave the parking lot.\"This is one of the highlights of Jasper Park. The Falls are a very easy walk from the parking lot. The paths are set up to get great views of the falls from several angles.The falls were some distance outside Jasper but well worth a visit. The surrounding mountains were very majestic as was the Falls themselves. The noise and the water volume were stunning.\"This place does get crowded so I would suggest going early in the day, plenty to look out, pretty amazing geology. Walk down to the little beach its beautiful!\"\"just off the highway and a short easy walk to the falls which has a concrete bridge overlooking them, there is a pathway which will take you further down the waterfall to its base in the lake, its amazing to see how the water over the years has cut through the layers of rock leaving a very scenic walkway\"Great falls. A bridge allows you to walk over to the other side and admire the falls from both sides. We really enjoyed walking through the dried up canyon.Beautiful area need to spend sometime here not rush it. You can take some great photos. Different options available depending on ability to access areas.\"Photographs are my goal and these falls are dynamic. Power, colour and surroundings are so beautiful. Trails can be a little slippery as it is misty so walk carefully. They are close to the parking lot and there are some really nice trails all around.\"\"Visited as part of a tour, great sight to see and good photo opportunity and, although lovely to look at, wouldn't have visited unless it was part of the tour.\"\"Athabasca falls is on the Icefields parkway, only 20 miles outside of Jasper. The parking lot is right along the parkway and a very short walk will take you to the falls. The power of the falls is so unexpectedly strong. Follow the easy trail along the canyon, and it’s hard to believe how calm Athabasca River is while it was just thundering through a very short distance up the canyon. It is well worth a stop.\"\"We did a white water rafting trip with Jasper Rafting down the Athabasca River and loved the scenery. Very cold day but wet suits keep you warmish.Our guide was very informative and fun.\"this was a fabulous part of our trip to Jasper- beautiful waterfall and lovely canyon pathways. Would recommend to anyone visiting the area.\"This can get busy, but it is well worth a visit, suggest later in the day as its not far form Jasper along the Ice Fields Parkway\"\"Been here twice, and both times the sights and sounds have blown us away. Easy to walk around, comfortably accessible from the parking area.\"The access to such amazing falls is surprisingly easy! It's well worth a stop if you are traveling south from Jasper. There are picnic tables near the parking lot if you want to enjoy your lunch but they may be full as it's a popular stop.very busy location but when you get close to the falls its amazing. there are nice areas to get some good shots and places to read about the history\"Stopped by pretty much by chance, and when we got out of the car, was sure it wasn't worth the time. Boy were we wrong. Wound up spending 2 hours admiring the power and awesomeness of nature, particularly the velocity of water. Well worth the trip!!\"This is a must-see if you're visiting Jasper National Park. At certain times of the year (early spring and summer) the falls are at their peak and very inspiring to see. There is a cute little restaurant at the entrance of the road leading to the falls that is a great place to stop for lunch or a snack.Beautiful falls in a beautiful setting. Easy access. Great way to see the beauty and power of nature.\"So glad we stopped off to see this - it was much more that we expected - stunning! You can see a certain amount with just a short easy walk, or venture further over more rocky paths for more amazing views.\"Great hiking in the area. Lots of trails and beautiful scenery. It was cold so wear lots of layers. Wonderful place for plenty of Kodak moments.\"Athabasca Falls is beautiful. Even considering the crowd of people, I'd advise anyone to stop during their exploration of the Icefields Parkway. Don't just stop at the first viewpoint; take time to walk the area and appreciate all of the viewpoints. Because of the large number of tourists, we did not linger -- only spent about 30 minutes.\"\"I've been here numerous times over the years and throughout the different seasons, things have changed over the years and it's more fenced in for safety these days. Yes, there are fools that climb over the railing and put no only themselves in danger but those who would have to rescue them. The view of the falls is beautiful and one could easily spend hours just sitting there taking in the view and sound of the falls. However, the spot gets very crowded at times and some folks aren't polite and basically push their way in front of you to get a photo. Really not necessary as some of us (myself) would be willing to take the group photo for them if only good manners would shown.It's certainly a spot I'll return...just hoping the next time it will be less busy. You can easily bring your kids with you - just ensure you hold their hand as it can get a little slippery in some spots.\"an easy place to visit with few steep hikes! you can chose to walk more or less and the paved pathways will give you a good view.Enjoyed taking time here but lots of people around - easy access for coaches. May need to fight for photo spots. Many viewing points. Do the walk down the old river route (there are a few steps) which takes you to different views of the canyon and the river - crowds thin out here and you can sit on rocks by the water. Unfortunately steps mean difficult for wheelchair access to most of the site.\"It's a beautiful, natural attraction - which is still free of charge! I highly recommend stopping and taking time to explore the falls and the canyon while you are passing through the area.\"\"I have visited the Athabasca Falls three times during the last 4 years and in three different seasons. It has been accessible in April and October – for sure in July as well. And it has been worth seeing it in all seasons.In April it was frozen, in October it had the most amount of water and it was for sure and by far the most crowded in July. Incredible! Be sure to go there early in the morning when you want to take some pictures without a bunch of idiotic tourists who climb over fences to get the most amazing picture using the longest selfie-stick you have ever seen. If you go there to be entertained, go there around noon during peak season. I promise you, you will be amazed how stupid the majority of the Brewster bus tourists are… I can still barely believe what I saw.Other than that: One of the iconic spots in the Canadian Rockie´s Nationalparks and a must see.\"\"Absolutely will go back there- so amazing and so beautiful !!Short walk from the parking lot and different levels to view from.

Parcs Canada has built platforms from which you can get great views of the turquoise-colored water plunging over rocks. Don't miss this!\"We came here because of all of the already great reviews and it we were not disappointed. About 30 mins out of the Jasper - it wasn't too congested and the sights were amazing. (Great to grab a few photos for your instagram followers)The waterfall is something you can just stand there and take in for some time - the sound and overall power of the falls is captivating. Not far down on a trail is the lower area where the water eventually comes down to a clearing. Here you can grab some more pretty pictures & pose with the crystal clear waters.Free, beautiful, natural; what more could you want?\"Beautiful waterfalls and canyon. Get there early so you don't have to deal with all the tour buses and tourists.

Well worth a visit\"The crowds couldn't ruin the beauty of this place, though by the state of the public toilets you're almost convinced that they're actually trying to...GROSS but not the Falls fault, so not incorporating that experience into my review. Allow some time to walk to the bottom of the canyon to where the river widens out and avoid the first view point at the top especially during visits during peak periods of summer and long weekends, unless you're nostalgic for a mosh pit full of tourists. all trying to take the same picture (now I miss the Mona Lisa)...\"A must stop!!! Walk around a bit - ignore all the crowds - it's still beautiful! It's an easy walk almost all can handle it.\"Beautiful, powerful, amazing waterfall.

Well worth taking a trip back to visit if you are driving to Jasper from Banff and are sceniced out from the Icefield Parkway.\"Really beautiful falls, what it doesn't have in height it makes up for in power. Great viewing spots, easily accessible for all the family. Nice walking trail leading from main falls to the lower river\"As with anything in Jasper the overcrowding took away from the beauty of the falls.

It was an enjoyable place to stop for half an hour.\"Lovely falls we visited on the drive to jasper. Free parking once you get into the park. The falls are just a little walk from the car park. Well worth a stop off.\"At the time of our visit, this was rated No 1 in the area on Trip Advisor. It's a decent sized waterfall, but nothing special. Worth a 30 minute stop, and it's free.

A nice spot to stretch your legs to the sound of running water.\"This is one of the many attractions on the Icefields Parkway. The waterfalls are big and powerful and right off the parkway, so it is easy to get to. On the downside, it gets VERY crowded, so get there early or late in the day.\"\"Amazing roars of water just about 20 minutes from Jasper.There, the falls carves a deep canyon.The misty water will cool you down in the summer.\"\"We stopped off at the falls on our way from Jasper to Banff and it was worth the stop. Beautiful falls and very nicely set up with lookout points on either side of the river. It was a bit crowded mid-afternoon so if you are looking for a peaceful visit, you may want to pick a time that is a bit less busy.

The power of the water amazingJust about 10 mins from jasper, good parking, toilet facilities.\"Spectacular falls a short drive from Jasper.

Some of the parts on the paths are not so stroller friendly but others are. We had a great time and got some cute pictures. But the places is pretty popular so it could be crowded.\"If you are in and around Jasper nd want a photo op with a good waterfall in the foreground and a great mountain backdrop, then this is the place for you :) It is not extra special in this area of jaw-dropping beauty but convenient location and ease of access will really cost you no extra time.\"\"Wonderful views of the falls and great touristy attraction. If you want a quieter experience, go early in the morning and enter the area from the highway so you don't get roped into the \"\"do not cross\"\" propaganda.

It does not take long, the crowds are not onerous and it is a wonderful way to get out and stretch your road legs.Listen and read the signs about staying within the rail boundaries. It was disheartening to read the stories of the 2-young men memorialized on benches after losing their lives trying to get an up-close look at the Falls.

It is definitely a must stop in Jasper National Park. There is a nice trail around it (on both sides) so that you can a nice view from all angles. It is easily accessible. We were there around 4PM.

Loved driving on the old highway to get there!Jaw dropping falls .. well worth 30 - 60 mins of your life .. powerful Canadian nature at its best .. loved it ...A pretty short walk takes you to some very pretty falls between different rock formations. Good photo opportunities. a very worthwhile stop.\"Beautiful spot and well worth exploring, but if you're travelling during peak season, arrive early to avoid the crowds.\"\"The Falls are right by the road, so it's an easy stop. I would highly recommend it. Although we had seen a lot of water falls, this was worth the stop.\"\"nice little walk with many great views of the falls. Nothing hard so good for anyone of all ages. Fence is in place for safety, but may want to hold onto children.\"\"The \"\"Athabasca Falls\"\" (a number of smaller falls) are located approx. 30km south of Jasper/Alberta,close to the \"\"Icefields Parkway\"\" (#93).If driving south from Jasper,sideroad #93A is somewhat slower,but more scenic.What my wife and I liked the most about these falls,was its (for the lack of other words) \"\"compact footprint\"\". 1 hour is enough to explore them.The falls are located only minutes from the parking lot.The area around the falls is fairly level and for easy walking,good news for people with mobility issues.There are several viewing points,most of them close to the rushing,thundering water.Lots of exiting photo opps,incl. odd rock formations,so do not forget your camera.But watch the lens for water spray.A steep trail (lots of steps!) leads to the bottom of the gorge.When traveling between Jasper & Banff you should allow some time for these falls.\"\"Lovely waterfalls and scenic walk and well worth your time if you are in Jasper. Athabasca Falls are not the tallest you'll see, or the fastest, but they are still really pretty and only a short drive from Jasper. Well worth a visit and not too crowded either, at least not when we were there!\"Beautiful thundering waterfall and quite accessible for travellers. Close to the highway and an absolute must see if you get anywhere near Jasper. The etching of stone from the falls and river is a remarkable view and appreciated by all ages.Roaring falls in a stunning setting. Saw the glaciers off in the distance. The overlook path allows visitors to see the falls up close.Nature's beauty shouldn't be overlooked . Good picnic spot and outdoor bathrooms available . Good walkways to see the falls from various angles.\"Worth the stop on the road trip! You see the falls, and can walk 59 steps to the lower part of the river to a beach, nice photo opps. Altogether it was a nice stop from the Columbia icefield to Jasper!\"This is beautiful and worth the hike. It's breathtaking. Take time to read the science behind why and how the falls were created. Path was wheelchair accessible.\"The beauty beyond words. Interesting and informative plaques. Great spot for pictures. We walked down to the canyon level steep and uneven, this level should only recommended for those fit enough to do that type of walk, I did not see signs listing difficulty levels.\"On the morning we visited these falls it was cold and raining and a bus load of other tourists had just arrived but ot still absolutely worth the stop.\"A great attraction, some great scenery. Too many pushy tourists and happy camera snappers though. A nice stop just outside of Jasper.\"\"Athabasca Falls is a must see, The Falls are very powerful and very beautiful. Nature is a powerful force in action and these falls prove it. It's only a short and easy walk to the falls so no excuses if you are in the area! Be aware that there will likely be lots of people viewing at the same time. It's worth the additional small walk to the bottom of the falls to see the view across the valley. Enjoy!\"Awesome to witness and hear the force of nature. Makes me wish I had studied physical geography at school.\"Pretty but, seriously, just a waterfall. If you're from the pacific northwest or surrounding areas, you've seen better. Take the time to see Maligne Canyon... it was a lot more impressive and interesting.\"These falls were some of the best we saw on our trip - and we saw a few! Amazing to see how the force of the water has eroded and channeled the rock over the years. Truly awe inspiring to watch the power of the water.\"What a beautiful look out. Well worth the stop. The sheer power of that water is amazing. Its easy to get to and if you want more, there are longer trails.\"A beautiful place! Amazing falls and lots of little walking paths. You can walk all the way down to the river as well. The kids loved it.Impressive bit of nature! It has a lot of people around but only because it is something you must see. It does require some walking if you want to take it all in.\"This is a great sight seeing activity if you're not up for a long walk. You don't have to go very far to see everything. We went when it was still half frozen and it was incredible. The surroundings are amazing as well. Definitely recommend, plus its free!!\"We stopped by while driving to Jasper and must say that they are nice and it is just a 10 minutes walk to see them.\"The falls were very crowded in the summer, but it is worth a stop to take in the falls. If the crowds get to you, take a quick hike into the woods and you will be fine\"\"Based on the reviews, we picked this hike for our trip. Parked at fifth bridge and walked up to the upper parking lot and back. Along the way we were astounded by the beauty of waterfalls, canyon, water, rocks, and bridges. The hike has lots of up and down on uneven surfaces, so not recommended for those who have trouble walking. There is an easier and shorter loop from the upper parking lot though for those who need it. If you can though I highly recommend the longer loop. We returned via the horse trail which added aDifferent view.\"Pretty spot and worth a look. The falls are impressive and the canyon which has resulted from the power of the falls in very beautiful.Beautiful scenery. Wear good shoes so that you can go for a hike while you're there and not worry about slipping on wet rocks. Bring a camera! No cost other than entry fee into National Park.\"Stopped at the Athabasca Falls location for a lunch break. Very impressive falls and the power was impressive. Nice place to take a break, but the picnic tables were a long distance back from the falls area. Would be nice to move a table or two closer to the area to enjoy the view and natural sounds of the area.Viewing areas were varied and made for a nice walk and exploration.\"Easily accessed and good for a short visit. Steps are involved but there are handrails. It's worth walking the ten minutes to the furthest viewing point for the waterfall and if light is right you will see a rainbow\"When we were planning the Western leg of our family's Trans Canada Road Odyssey, one of the MUST SEES we had listed out was Athabasca Falls.And while returning from Jasper via Mt. Edith Cavell to Calgary, we stopped for quite some o admire this marvel of nature. Not only are the falls highly impressive but the surrounding rock formations in a variety of shapes and colours are just astonishing. We walked around the area, crossing a number of bridges to take in the sightsThe roaring water cascading over the rock and disappearing into a gorge and reappearing a little distance away was a magnificent sight and we took our time to savour its beauties.Earlier, we had descended from Mt. Edith Cavell, which is also something to put you in awe of nature. I climbed to the edge of the glacier to appreciate the floating icebergs in the lake at the foot of the mountain and the glacier which looked like a moose head, was unique. The greenish lake fed by the glacier was also an awe inspiring sight and after quite some attempts, we found a spot from where we could get Mt. Edith Cavell reflected in its still water, really a mind boggling sight!!!En route, we also took a detour to see Moab lake where we found the surrounding conifer forest lining the mountainside had been blackened during a forest fire some years ago. The lake itself was a hidden gem, its still blue- green water perfectly reflecting the hillsides around.This detour was indeed one of the most rewarding during our Rockies trip\"\"Easy to get to, but also many people, even from early morning. Great stop, and many Angela to take pictures from. Must see.\"\"Beautiful and exciting hike, when we went it was raining, so we have to be really careful walking. I believe it will be even nicer when the weather is promising.\"Definitely worth the stop! Lots of picture opportunities. Great parking even for large vehicles. Lots of people visiting but didn't feel too crowded.\"Very easy stop and we'll worth it (even if it were tough to get to, it would be worth it). Great stop with my parents, which cannot handle tougher hikes. One of the best stops in the park.\"\"Not a large fall, but you can get really up close. Good viewpoints - both of the Fall and the canyon; can also walk down to the river level. A nice getaway if you have 1-2 hours.\"\"Sure, it's pretty to see these falls. It is also a quick stop when heading down the road. Give yourself about 20 minutes to see all of this. A plus is that it is cooler here than inland=refreshing!\"Not too far from your car if you are not a big time hiker. The watr is amazing and the view is like a painting. In the winter the snow on the trees looks like a postcard and the bridges cross over the steep canyons below.\"These Falls were amazing. The sound and sight of the rushing water was amazing, and there was something new to see round every corner.\"\"I visited the Athabasca Falls in the early evening (say, around 6 PM?) and it was perfect. A lot of people were leaving the falls, probably to have dinner. The falls themselves are very powerful and mesmerizing to watch. I recommend visiting the falls 100%!\"\"These falls are some of the most beautiful views I've ever seen, with a (very) minimal amount of hiking. An absolute must see.\"Clean area fantastic viewing. The falls never let you down. Especially go to the far side where you all most stand over themThis was one of the places that we had planed to visit. It is a beautiful and wild place to visit. It was very busy as there were buses stopping as well. Well worth the time for sure. There are lots of information plaques to look at.\"Well worth your time to stop and enjoy this waterfall. The falls are only a very short walk from the parking lot, so this works if you have people in your party who can only walk short distances. There are viewpoints on both sides of the lake above the falls, on both sides at the falls, a bridge over the falls, and a viewpoint below the falls. All of them are enjoyable and give you opportunities for great photos.Athabasca Falls is just off Highway 93 (Icefields Parkway) on Highway 93A. There is lots of parking, but it can also be very busy midday. Coming in the morning or late afternoon will help you in the parking lot and with the crowds at the viewpoints.\"\"Not much to say here other than the fact that I appreciate that there were no large tour busses and loud people rushing around. In fact, although the area did see quite a bit of traffic, it didn't affect my experience. I found that the falls were very easy to get to...just a few minutes' walk from the parking lot AND you can take a staircase down to the river. It was fantastic to do a quick in-and-out !\"\"IF you are on a driving tour-- good for you! You just picked one of the best sites to visit. If you are on a bus tour you may regret not having enough time to see the Falls the deep pot-holes and water-carved rock formations. If you love rock \"\"out croppings\"\" this is the place for you. If you love the sound of rushing water, ditto also. I also highly recommend downloading the Gypsy app for your iPhone or android phone which for only a few bucks gives you the full history of the area.If going in the summer keep a small bottle of Avon SSS (Skin So Soft) handy to chase away the mosquitoes.\"\"The Athabasca Falls are a great place to stop and stretch your legs when travelling Hwy 93. The falls are located about 32 Km (give or take) south of Jasper. The walking trails are pretty good but make sure to keep everyone on the trails and eye on the kids (of all ages). Way to many people get carried away and end up in the soup. You will more then likely not survive the 23 meter fall.There is also a chance for wild life so be prepared accordingly.Good idea to bring a sweater or wind breaker, it cools off a fair amount in the shady parts of the trail. Bottle of water is in order.Parking is good, even for RV's. Washrooms available.\"These are well worth a visit and are quite spectacular with various different view points so you are best to spend the time moving from one to another to get different views of the falls and to led the crowds move on. Recommended and its free.\"Amazing! Always a must do on every trip to Jasper. So beautiful, don't miss it! Can get very busy during the day.\"\"We enjoyed our trip to these falls. The water comes from an attractive lake and is forced over the falls with a good deal of momentum. There's a reasonable amount of noise and a good deal of spray and some damp paths that can be a bit slippery. You can view the falls from a number of locations but, like many places, it can get crowded.\"This is an excellent point of interest along the Icefields Parkway. They have done an excellent job of giving multiple viewpoints for the falls and canyon. Well worth the stop. We spent about 45-60 minutes here.An easy pull off from the highway. Ample parking. Stunning view of the falls. Drawback...the usual long drop toilet.\"Really lovely place to visit - the falls are quite impressive with lots of spray and you can cross over and see them from both sides, which is nice. We didn't walk further down the creek as we were on a tour and only had a short amount of time.\"This is a very popular location so you would be wise to arrive early or very late. I'm talking theme park crowds. The falls area is truly spectacular with multiple viewpoints to view different parts of the falls from every possible angle. Some of the viewpoints are wheelchair accessible but others require negotiating many and sometimes narrow steps. The main viewpoints are fenced to minimize accidental falls into the frothing water. Entering the water anywhere close to the main falls would likely be catastrophic.\"So worth seeing, How can you go wrong when you can be surrounded by such beauty and majestic scenery!\"\"To find these falls, you drive south of Jasper and then take a narrow road for about 30 km. It isn't the best road, but the falls are truly amazing. The parking lot is huge. There are outhouses in the parking lot. The falls are a short walk from the parking lot. The sound of the rushing water is amazing. The falls themselves are something else. You can see them from several vantage points. There are 'potholes' that are holes that have been carved away by the constant whirling of the water. The layers of rock that have been carved away by the water is incredible. There are some stairs, but very few. The walk to see all vantage points could be done by most.\"Very easy to get to because it was right off the road. Very short hike and very impressive falls. It was worth seeing because it was so accessible.We loved this place. Even though it was busy it is possible to find your own space to appreciate the different views.There is no admission charge & you can easily spend an hour there. I would recommend going downstream as well as the upper levels. Here you can sit & watch in peace. Excellent\"Beautiful place to stop along the Icefield Parkway near Jasper National Park,easy trail to the falls. There are a few trails to choose depending on how long you want to hike.\"Worth the trip. Gets very busy so try and arrive early to get a parking space. Combine with icefileds trip.\"What a beautiful site to behold, the falls offer so much beauty at any time of the year, I recommend seeing it during all the changes in the season, walking the path around the falls to see what Mother Nature has created over thousands of years is a must, it's free, it's peaceful and you really will be in aw.\"\"More spectacular than many of the other falls/lakes alongside the Ice Field Parkway.Easily accessible and just beautiful on a sunny day!\"Beautiful falls. Easy access to them. They end in the thundering Maligne canyon which is a short distance awayThe glacier is melting away. The giant truck that carry the tourist on to the ice are great and being on the glacier is amazing.\"We all thoroughly enjoyed it (ages 11 to 61). The natural beauty and power on display was impressive and mesmerizing. Walkways are easy to navigate and the display boards helped us appreciate nature's power. Don't miss the stairs down to the bottom which follow the ancient water path...phenomenal. We spent about 90 minutes, but it won't take that long if you aren't camera-happy like us.Plus, it's all free. Easily the best of our day trip up the Icefields Parkway from Jasper.Tip: for best photos, go early in the day...lighting at this time provided excellent photographs.\"\"As others have stated, easy to find, easy hike, good up close to falls and the canyon. Can be crowded.\"Allow at least 45 minutes to explore up and down on both sides. Good little hiking opportunity with lots of scenic beauty.Athabasca falls are gorgeous and the thing that stands out for me is the roaring sound they make. The viewpoints are well placed and it is easy to take great photos!\"Just beautiful and well worth a visit. The hiking trail to the falls is short and fairly level. It is fabulous to visit at anytime of the year. Covered in ice or roaring in summer, the falls are just gorgeous.\"\"Really pretty. It's on the way to Jasper, easy to access and not to be missed. Easy hike, gorgeous pIctures.\"\"A powerful, and picturesque place just of the main highway. A series of waterfalls in a short slot canyon. Great photo ops. Be sure to take the trail down to the bottom.\"\"An interesting stop along the highway, the falls aren't anything spectacular but they're definitely worth visiting!\"\"Not a big set of falls, but lots of places to get great views. You get up close and personal with not only the falls, but the canyon and geological changes due to the river/falls. In the winter the falls freeze which is awesome to see!\"Beautiful spot to enjoy a morning coffee! Be sure to bring one to enjoy this impeccable view. Also carrying a camera is a must for this sight!!Not to far from the highway (so still noisy and not as peaceful as other spots in Jasper) and yet one of the best things to see in Jasper. Great hike and a great place for good pictures.Short stop but nothing exciting. Falls are not that tall compare to what you would expect in the rockies.\"I love these Falls! I had been here at least 10 times, and I enjoy it every time! Eventhough it's just a 22 meter hige, yet the fact that you can see it frome all angles and get very close to the falling water, makes it so special. Allow at least one hour at the falls.\"Located 30 km south (towards Banff) this is well worth a visit.The falls are well signposted like all the other sights along the icefield parkway so you wont miss it.Parking area is just a minutes walk from the falls so no long hike to get there.There are multiple viewing points and a bridge that crosses the gorge.The river cascades down a narrow gorge and there are potholes that have formed from the rocks grinding into the river bed.There is also a short but steep (with steps) walk down to the lake . Its only a 3-4 minute walk and worth doing. There is a vantage point just below the falls which gives a great view of the lake.\"Visited here on a Brewsters Jasper to Banff Glacier trip. Beautiful day with clear skies. Make sure you walk from the car park all the way round the other side to the falls, absolutely beautiful with the rainbow appearance.\"Two minutes from the highway. This falls is a must!! Breathtaking views. Plenty of parking spaces. Well signposted.This is a stunning place the visit. The noise and the views are spectacular. It doesn't cost you anything for such an amazing experience. Worth a look for sure.Minimal Hiking necessary and close from the Highway. A must on the way to Jasper. Refreshing.... takes less than 60 min\"Not the biggest waterfall I've ever seen, but certainly one of the most magical. I would not have been surprised to see fairies or gnomes walking on the green moss beside this waterfall. Extremely scenic; I found it enchanting!\"Walk all around the paths. Every view is worth. The rock formations are beautiful as well as the clear water falling. The place is clean and well preserved. A must when you are near Jasper.One of the easiest waterfalls to get to and one of the most spectacular. A must see. It was a hot day when we were there so it was easy to cool down in the spray plume on the far side of the falls.Very busy but understandably since it's such an awesome sight. Parking slightly difficult at busy times if you arrive in an RV.\"Easy walk, well worth it, can get busy late in the day, so try and be there early. Parking can also be problematic over weekends and Public Holidays\"\"We stopped off here on our way to Lake Louise. When we pulled into the car park there was a black bear having breakfast. What an amazing surprise. We watched it with several other people before it wandered through the Woods, walked casually down the pavement and then disappeared into the woodland.Oh, and the falls were good too!\"\"its a beautiful find in nature, but there are a lot of tourists. there is a small hike to the bottom of the falls, you can even put your feet in the water.\"\"A short distance from the Icefield Parkway, usually plenty of parking, and a tremendous view of what must be the greatest volume of water going over a waterfall in Western Canada.A second visit, slightly less water than in 2013, but then again, that was the year of the flooding in South Alberta. Still as spectacular, though\"These falls are right off the freeway and a short walk from the parking area. No admittance fee. Absolutely one of the most beautiful falls I have ever seen.\"Not mentioned in every guidebook, this is an up-close-and-personal experience with a high velocity waterfall. Found just back of a small car park beside the 'old road' from Banff to Jasper. No facilities or café/restaurant.... but stop here anyhow!\"\"A must for anyone travelling the icefield parkway, a short flat walk from the car park so within the ability of anyone with mobilty difficulties and so photogenic, particularly this time of year when the melt water is flowing strongly.One recommendation is if you have the time, to take the 93a to or from Jasper. The road is much slower and as such, much quieter. There are far more opportunities to see wildlife and it is nicer to travel at a slower pace\"\"You can't visit Jasper and not visit the Athabasca Falls. Well, you can, but you'd be mad to miss out on this. A fantastic example of the raw power of nature, beautiful and awe inspiring. It seems bizarre to think that watching water rush between rocks can be this thrilling.\"It is very pretty but go very early or late in the day when it isn't overrun with busloads of others.Very well-marked trails and informative guidance throughout. All of us tourists are reducing these places' viability!There are lots of waterfalls in Banff and Jasper National Parks but these are stunning and beautiful and easy for anyone to see. You can hear and feel the power of rushing water when you get near these falls. They are a short ways off the highway and an easy walk from the parking lot. The falls crash into a deep canyon with such force that the area is wet with spray and viewing areas are often a bit slippery. But these falls are well worth a viewing. A reminder of the power of water and the force of nature.\"Young or old this is a very doable, must see stop on the Icefield parkway. I know there are a million Falls to see but this one is so well layed out that you can see them from all sides. They flow north?!! for 6000 kilometers and enter the Arctic. Can't wrap your head around that but can see this natural wonder up front and personal!\"An excellent photo opportunity. Really worth the stop off. Hang on to the kids hands though .. it is wild country.\"The scenery at the falls was amazing, there is a walkway with railing around the area with lots of points to safely get the best view of the falls and rock formations.\"The ice parkway has sooooo many choices. This one is quite near Jasper and the falls are a short hop from the car. Really amazing - but they all are really !Don't miss this stop along the Columbia Icefields Parkway. The walk to the viewing platforms for the falls are a short walk and easily accessible for all levels. Further hiking is available.\"One of the best \"\"falls\"\" we saw during our trip around the Rockies well worth the visit. The restaurant was good also\"\"Nice, easy access to the best falls in area. Able to take different view shots of spectacular falls. Make sure you take the trail to the bottom to view canyon towards falls.\"\"It was busy with tourists, but worth the look!Loads of parking, and nice pathways.Spend time having \"\"your time\"\" with the falls as people can be pushy.\"\"Our tour made a stop at the Athabasca Falls. BEAUTIFUL!!! If anyone is in the area of Jasper, be sure to include this stop. The amount of water going over the falls is amazing. When stopping at the Columbia Icefields, you actually get to see where this river gets its start and how it enlarges over the miles traveling to the falls. A must see!\"A wonderful sight. The power of the turbulent water surging over the waterfall and around the rocks was magnificent.\"Loved these falls. Not suitable for people with poor mobility. Good view of both the 'top' and 'bottom' of the waterfall. Nice simple explanations of geology. Parking was sufficient, toilets nearby. No refreshments nearby offered.\"\"Lovely to see a water fall at eye level instead of from the ground looking up. Lovely scenery around the area as well. Seen many water falls and a lot larger than this one and I would rate it as average at best, but it is still worth a look on your travels especially if you are into this type of thing. Lots of people in cars and buses pull up so it is probably best to get there first thing in the morning if possible.\"\"This falls is down inside a rock gorge and makes a 90 degree turn as it falls. It is an easy and short walk from a parking lot off highway 93, \"\"The Icefields Parkway.\"\" The noise and power of the water is amazing. Definitely worth a stop and visit.\"Very impressive falls certainly worth a visit. Paths easy to walk around and you can get close enough to get wet. Plenty of car parking.It's a nice enough waterfall but nothing special - it's not worth going out of your way to visit. Surprised it's number 1 in things to do in Jasper.\"The force and velocity of the falls cannot be understood until you are standing in situ. It is quite breathtaking. If you can get away from the many tourists taking dangerous 'selfies' on the edge, it is a heavenly view ??\"Go early or later in the day though as it was packed with tourists when we were there so I wasn't too impressed. The canyon is pretty cool.This is definitely worth a visit if you are driving between Jasper and Lake Louise. The extraordinary roar of the water and the wonderful scenery all around are breath taking.\"Big, loud, and impressive. We were in Jasper and drove to this Falls to check it out quickly. It was so amazing that we stopped by again on the way back to Calgary.\"like every place in Banff/Jasper - arriving early during high season will improve your impression of these beautiful natural areas. Athabasca Falls is most certainly worth the 1/2 hour stop to explore all trails and signs.\"It is gorgeous, impressive and touching! It is a must see water fall attraction. The loud noise of the water fall and the must from the great water fall will touch your heart with this beautiful nature!You Must See this attraction!\"\"Awesome awesome awesome. Powerful. Gorgeous. Go. No matter what physical condition you are in, you can do this.\"\"We did our road trip at the height of the drought and wildfire hazard time. The falls were beautiful. The people, however, were not very smart--despite all the signs everywhere about extreme wildfire hazards, and despite the level 4 drought warnings, people were smoking all over the trails around the falls. I just wish others could use some common sense when in nature. We drove through a region with about 360 wildfires. Why throw gasoline on the fire?\"\"This is part of what makes a vacation in the Canadian Rockies such a great experience. The falls are splendid ,the setting is picture perfect with the mountains in the background ,the rushing milky blue waters and the roar of the falls.The sound is captivating as you look with awe at the power of the water. The pathway and lookoutsare well positioned to give views from many angles.An abandoned canyon has a stairway down that helps give perspective to the magnitude of this natural wonder ,the rock is carved and etched layer by layer.This is a must see only 20 min from town of Jasper lots of parking , easy access even with children.\"\"Breathtaking scenery,was busy with people when we were therePlenty of parkingcareful walking, gets slippery\"\"This is a Must go to place in Jasper. love at first site. Gorgeous falls, scenic route. good for hiking.\"\"These falls are absolutely amazing, the strength of the water rushing down is awesome. I'm not sure if these falls has a walk around it, but be sure to do it. Not for the frail.\"So much water! A great water fall to witness the power of water. It's worth a quick stop to check out the falls.We could see the water mist rising and decided to take a look and so glad we did. We were surprised there weren't more people there to see the stunning Beaty and power of nature. Don't miss this one.A scenic view of a glacier spilling over rocks to sculpt them into gorgeous formations! A must see while in the area. We hiked through this with many other people so choose an early morning time if possible.\"The falls are beautiful! There is a short walk and should be good for people of any physical ability to enjoy, which is nice. We had taken the Athabaska Glacier tour a couple of hours before and were on our way to Jasper and made this stop. Super glad we did!\"\"Many signs to waterfalls in Alberta, Canada. The Athabasca is the one you just have yo visit. Experience the power of nature here. It's like the Niagara fall but on a smaller scale.\"Dropped by on our drive from Banff to Jasper. Really awe-inspiring and very accessible. It's silly to have to use 100 characters as there really isn't anything else to say\"Almost didn't bother stopping for these - glad we did! Very impressive, and you get a real sense of the power of nature. Lots of info on helpful boards, in particular about how dangerous they are, but this didn't stop a daft student perch on the railings to get the perfect selfie - she was lucky she didn't go for a last dive! Definitely recommend! You could spend a good few hours here just watching the water!\"\"You may have heard of it, you may have seen it, but Athabasca Falls is an incredible experience. My wife and I went to see Athabasca Falls recently, but it actually has to be \"\"experienced\"\" in person to fully appreciate the power and beauty that it is. From the sheer volume of water that pours over the falls each second to the deafening roar of the same, this is a place you must come and be in awe of the power of nature in action. If you are going on the Icefields Parkway near Jasper or staying in the area, you owe it to yourself to come experience the Athabasca Falls. You will be glad you did.\"\"If you travel Jasper NP don't forget to stop the Athabasca Falls.It is said that 15 million cubic meter of water per second !! will flow down these falls.Striking awesome !\"We have been to Banff and Jasper parks. This was one of the most impressive sights we've seen. One can really appreciate the power of nature.We were there early in July and the falls were full and spectacular. This is well worth the short hike.\"A must do on the Ice field parkway it is around 20 minutes before Jasper town heading from Calgary or Banff. Please do the complete trail which is not very arduous, There is a circle loop to view the falls , the canyon lookout, the pot holes, and a trail down to the river bed. The gushing Athabasca river gushes down and the fine spray of water from certain points is so refreshing.\"\"A must see! The wonder of nature. Many photo opts here. You will be amazed at the beauty of the falls. From the falls we took Hwy 1A, it is well worth the time for the scenic trip.\"I was tired of visiting all the lakes and glaciers and was wondering if I must make a stop here. I am glad I did. The falls was impressive and it flowed down over several levels. Depending on the time available you could follow the falls right down to the river. A nice spot to spend a good half hour. Parking and toilets near the entrance.Athabasca Falls were full the first part of July and so beautiful! Definately not to be missed on a trip to Jasper.\"Well worth pulling off the road! The falls are gorgeous, and it's worth taking 15 minutes to walk along the various viewing platforms and take lots of photos!\"\"These falls were the last sightseeing stop on our Brewster Tours trip between Lake Louise and Jasper. We didn't have that much time there and it started to rain. There were some nice bits to it, and if we had more time it would have been good to explore more.\"there is a small trail that provides several different views of the falls. Take the time to see this site!Rated number one probably because of its easy access and beauty. Power of the water is amazing. Beautiful waterfall.Plenty of parking and lots of areas to walk around and take photos. Can get crowded between 10-3pm when the bus tours come. Otherwise Beautiful falls:)\"The Athabasca Fall is a beautiful area and a nice nature walk for those who don't hike. It is accessible to most all. What a natural beauty! It is always amazing the way water cuts through rock, twists and turns, with such gorgeous blue water. Enjoy this beautiful area while in Jasper, it won't disappoint.\"\"Absolutely beautiful stop! I would highly recommed fhis for all travellers. It is a nice, easy walk with breathtaking views. It is a must see if you are driving through Jasper National Park.\"\"Definitely a place to visit! It's amazing to see such a powerful waterfall. Unfortunately, it's a bit crowded since most tour busses stop as well.\"Easily accessible from the road and worth it. Stay on marked trails so your loved ones don't have a reason to make a memorial for you.\"While not as high nor wide, you really can get close to these falls. An interpretative walking trail explains the wildlife, fauna and geological highlights. An easy stop off the road and the price is right -- FREE,\"\"Just a short walk from the car park which is itself close to the highway. Cooling mist rises, the flow of the falls is impressive, the crowds less so. Fairly tame whitewater rafting from the bottom of the falls.\"Beautiful falls. Involves some walking so not suitable for anyone that is bad on their feet or wheelchair user. Worth the trek if you can make it\"Pretty and not bad access for disabledParking and toilets nearbyAgain rammed with visitors seems its on the bus tour route mst f who seem to be Japanese and take their photograph no matter whs view or enjoyment it impedes\"\"My wife and I went there to see the beauty of the surrounding settings how they blend into the falls area and landscape of time made by a master builder. At that time of the year the ice and water low thank goodness for that because the people walking on the ice at that could be semi safe foolish thing to do,but people will be people. When thaw came all melted into place the falls did their job all beauty restored back in place, How everything has its place to function in proper time a mastermind instilled all of this. By watching and observing all this we learn from the simple things.\"This really is a must and is one of the best smaller water falls outside of South America and should not be missed.I enjoyed taking photos there. It is easy to get to. Lots of people doing the same thing. Better than the falls just further south.Good parking and easy of access to view these amazing Falls. Informative sign boards along the pathways.\"Parking busy but we found a spot right away. Short walks over excellent trails and great views of the falls. Be sure to explore around all the beautiful nooks and crannies for exotic rock formations and beautiful plants and flowers. Also stopped at Sunwapta Falls, also well worth taking a driving break to see.\"\"You could stop here really quickly and it is a great view! The parking lot is right there, and the walk was flat as well.\"Well worth a stop. Great falls and very milky water during summer due to glacial deposits. Good views of nearby mountains.Spectacular waterfalls pulsing with frothing turbulence and sparkling power. It was so awesome to watch from high above the water rage through the rock formations. No photos can truly capture the speed of the water as it dashes through the hewn rock walls.\"Definitely worth a visit, as everything on our self guided (Lonely Planet & info from Visitor Centres) tour seems to be. Easy to access the main area from the car park - OK for wheelchairs & babybuggies. The falls were a raging torrent when we visited, & throwing up rainbows. You can also view from different levels via steps & bridges & see the difference in the water colour where it enters the main river.\"Close to Jasper (about 20 miles away - close by Canadian standards) and well worth a visit. Make sure to go to the Lower Canyon and enjoy the peace and quiet beyond the falls.Well worth a stop here. Although the carpark was full there were enough advantage points for everyone to get some great pics. Definitely recommended.\"It's free with absolutely stunning views, what's not to like?Go a bit early in the day to avoid crowds. Definitely bring your camera!\"\"Lovely stroll learning about the formation of the falls, well worth the stop. Calming atmosphere and a good way to spend a couple of hours.\"Athabasca falls is a must do for anyone who hasn't been. There is easy access for those with limited mobility. You can also spend a longer amount of time if desired and walk the surrounding trials. Make sure to keep a close eye on young ones that will climb fencing.\"Meet the Athabasca river and its falls at a very close distance. You can also see a small canyon and the big Athabasca river. Nice spot to rest, relax and enjoy the sound of the water through the canyon and waterfall\"This is a very popular stop on the parkway. It has both a very powerful waterfall and a beautiful canyon. On the far side of the falls one of the viewpoints is so close to the churning water you can almost reach out and touch it.\"I have seen falls in the Blue Mountains in Australia but these were spectacular, certainly worth a visit.\"\"We have been here in the summer and winter and both were spectacular! Summer you will see the blue/green and muddy glacier water rush over the falls and swirl I the 'potholes'. In the with two the water is lower, but the mist freezes looking like whip cream floating above the rushing water. Easy paved hike. Some steps. Great picture overlooks.\"\"Stopping to view these falls, we had no idea what to expect. Wow! The end of the lake tapered to a powerful surge of water pouring over the rocks with an observation bridge above. When we were there it was crowded but somehow even that didn't spoil the awesome beauty and power of the falls. I am so glad we stopped there and walked further along the lake to view the whole area. It was truly awe inspiring.\"\"Great stop on the way from Banff to Jasper. Powerful waterfall, not the largest, but very impressive.\"Definitely worth a short stop...longer if you want to take a hike. The falls are quite beautiful and you can see them from several angles.\"You can see these falls from your car on the bridge, but it's worth it to park and walk to the overlooks. I've seen a lot of waterfalls and this is one of the most majestic in the world. It's not big, but the force of the moving water is truly awesome. Heed the warning signs of where and where not to walk - a slip could be fatal.\"\"I can only continue the previous reviewers' adjectives - awesome, stunning, breathtaking and very powerful. Worth the quick turn off the 93 to view these.\"It was just a very good experience. There was nothing to dislike. We liked the views it provided which were spectacular.\"We didnt have time to visit on our way from Banff so went back the next morning in to the park.So glad we did ,would not have missed this for the world .Just amazing ,a camera can never do it justice .\"\"It is a unique wonder of nature. Take the time to look around and take pictures. There are signs to warn visitors not to go beyond the rails into the falls...it is for good reason! We went in the morning, just before the tour buses arrived, around 9:30am. It was fairly quiet.\"The falls were great. small hike into the falls but they are quite beautiful. You can meet a lot of people from other countries. Japan this year.\"Don't miss this, it is gorgeous, with a very manageable hike for the whole family - DON'T FORGET YOUR CAMERA. It is also free with your park pass (we drove up on the 93A - the more scenic route, though everything is scenic here). Be warned, the facilities are out houses.\"\"A pretty pitstop on the drive. Very overcrowded with tourists though, hard to get any pictures without strangers in them.\"Had a great day at the falls amazing waterfall took great pictures all at no charge it's not the biggest falls but a great day out. No shops but there is outside toilets. Lots of little nooks to walk about .Doesn't take long if you don't have much time but you can spend the day and enjoy if you do. Worth every moment of your time!\"Beautiful place to visit, only a short walk to see the beautiful river and falls. Make sure you take your camera because there are plenty of places to take some awesome photos. Well worth the visit.\"\"Stunning waterfalls, easy access, good information, all for free. Watch out for mozzies though, they are vicious. Make sure you have insect repellant.\"\"One busy place in the summer! This is a stop on the tour bus circuit, so there are swarms of people at times. The trails around the falls are all paved and gated for safety. The falls are very scenic and the water is surprisingly white. There are lots of areas to explore and you can walk down to the river bed below and put your feet in the water. Great stop.\"\"On the main road leading to Jasper are these impressive falls on the Athabasca River. While not as big, they seemed as violent and breathtaking as Niagra. There are several well paved paths to gain different vantage points. A steep stair leads to the bottom of the falls that could be omitted if time and agility are a challenge. There are no facilities other than outside toilets at this stop.\"\"The Athabasca Falls change a little every time you go, but they never fail to impress. Jasper National Park has made this a wonderful, safe explore. Have been here many times and I am still amazed at water can do to rock.\"No dislikes..wonderful walks for everyone experienced and non experienced like myself....great for wildlife. The unexpected with the wildlife too appearing on the roads which everyone was aware and drove very carefully. Loved it!The falls are a great treat. Well done paved pathways take you to some lovely spots to see different angles and perspectives of this beautiful location. A must see when visiting the area.\"The power of nature on display. The water, the rocks, the trees. My 3 favourite things. It was absolutely beautiful. We could have stayed for hours had it not been for the thunder and lightning.\"\"It is a nice place but I guess compared to other magnificient places in Cdn Rockies, I am just giving it an average score.\"\"Must do both. Mt Edith is awesome-can do a fairly easy to moderate walk up close to mtn and glacier (sometimes rd to is not open). Athabasca falls is nice, and an easy walk. Saw bears and elk on the drive around these parts\"\"It would be easy to drive by the turnoff to Athabasca Falls as one approaches Jasper on the highway from Banff, but you would miss one of the best-kept secrets of the area.\"\"The power of water was so awesome - it was hard to leave the falls. It was a short walk from the bus to the top which provided great views, some people walked down the path go the bottom\"Athabasca Falls is one amazing place to see in Jasper National park. We visited without expectations but blown away by the all mighty force of nature. The summer months are most ideal to visit so temperature is in your favour. You cannot miss to visit this falls!\"Athabasca falls is a waterfall, with a drop of 80 ft (24 m) and a width of 60 ft (18 m). If you like waterfalls - you need to see this one!\"\"Lovely hiking and sights... worth the trip, bring water and have fun Nothing here not to like. If you love being outdoor it is a must to see this place.\"Huge powerful waterfall!! Easy walk to view this area...sound of rushing water lets you know that you are very close!!The power of the water is amazing and the walks down are really interesting.Real demonstration of natures force.\"The falls are amazing and there is a lovey route to follow to see it from different perspectives. If able, go down the mouth of the falls and sit on the beach, it's gorgeous and so tranquil!\"If driving the icefield this is worth a short visit. Well planned trails with about 50 steps to get down to the canyon and a few more to river. However best views are from the top and only takes 10 mins - about as long as it took us to park. Not the most impressive falls but pretty scenery so worth caling\"Athabasca Falls are about 30 km south of Jasper, so about 1/2 hour drive. The falls have cut a deep canyon. At the main falls there is a lot of spray, so in the mornings, you can often see rainbows in it. Several walk ways allow you to look down into the canyon. At the right time of year you can see the rare calypso orchids growing here. There are signs telling people not to go beyond the barriers, but silly people do - and occasionally someone falls in and dies. Don't go beyond the barriers - the rocks are slippery - the photo isn't worth it.\"Easy trail and the spectacular view is totally worth it. We even saw some animals in the way (birds and squirrels).It was smaller than I expected. 10 minute walk around and you've seen it all. Still very pretty though. A much much smaller version of Malinge Canyon.\"These falls are magnificent. They're not high, but show the power of water. A must see. They're a short distance from the road and are easy to get to.\"We stumbled upon these falls. They are some of the best falls I have seen. Be sure not to miss the turn off for these.\"The Banff-Yoho-Jasper National parks are filled with breath taking views and at least 6-8 lovely waterfalls, of which tos is one. It is about 20 miles south of Jasper and an easy walk from the Icefields Highway.\"Lovely view of a different kind of waterfall. it comes out of the rock into a cave and down again into a box canyon. Easy access.\"Our guided tour of the Falls treated us to lovely falls and scenic views as well as interesting info about Jasper and climate change in the area. After our short hike, we also learned about the wildlife in the area. We saw a bear!\"These wont be the biggest falls or the widest falls you've ever seen but they are worth a stop because you can get very close to them and the noise and power of the water is quite thrilling.Pull over and spend the time. Fabulous falls and great parking. Walkways friendly to all levels of mobility.\"Very pretty, not a hike, you drive right to it, it was very pretty, worth turning off the hwy for. We really enjoyed the Athabasca Falls.\"\"When we left the carpark to walk along the path to the falls, I thought this doesn't look like it's going to be much of a waterfall. No, it's not in the category of Niagara but it definitely is still awesome in it's own right. The river is wide and the falls are narrow and to see the intensity of the volume of water gushing through was amazing. We walked down the steps to see the water gushing through the canyon to continue into the river at the bottom. Enjoyed visiting this spot and it's an easy walk from the car park\"who well go to jasper ..there is some places have to and must have to see athabaca falls on the why onlyBeautiful falls but be careful! We saw way too many people climbing over rails to take pictures. Visit the falls early in the morning or after dinner to avoid crowdsWe really enjoyed seeing the falls again. Easy to access a short walk from the parking lot. One can take a short trail to vother viewpoints as well.\"A must see! Easy mostly flat paved walk, worth the few mins if takes. You can walk to both sides of the falls very easily. Make sure you walk to the other side, in the morning hours the spray from the falls creates a beautiful rainbow that you can take a picture of. There are restrooms here. They are of the outhouse sort..but better then the old fashion ones with the moon cut out windows!This should only take 20 mins but there are trails here if you wish to hike around.\"\"On the suggestion of the Columbia icefields bus driver, we stopped in at Athabasca Falls. It is a great spot to see the power of running water. Parks Canada has done well with the site to makes sure it is safe for families. It has lots of information on site about the Falls and its continual formation.\"A very short walk from the parking lot. A fairly powerful little falls. The walk ways take you close enough to feel the spray of the falls. Wonderful sounds of nature! No reason to pass this one by.\"This beautiful fall, although not too high, but created over centuries, many small, but complicated openings due to the soft rocks. Spending a few hours trying to understand the geological puzzle of cutting the rocks, due to shear force of water, over years, can earn you a doctoral degree. So, enjoy the beauty of the fall and leave your mind for the imagination !!\"\"My family (young son, wife) and I visited many falls in our travels and this is one of the best in terms of viewing and proximity to the fall itself (while maintaining safety). There are a few viewpoints that are easily access from the parking lot. Needless to say, it is a busy place during the summer, but not overcrowded in my opinion.\"Great opportunity to stand on a glacier. Temp was 95 degrees day we were there. On the glacier it was about 40 degrees. You can see five glaciers from one viewpoint. The skywalk shouldn't be missed. The also have a restaurant and cafe.I took my four year old to the falls. It was easy to get to and the pathways around the falls were well maintained and easy to follow. Excellent views and photo opportunities.We stopped off to see the falls when driving from jasper to lake Louise. The falls were spectacular in June as there was quite a good flow to the river. For me the most interesting part of the falls was the old discussed falls. Thousands of years ago the water changed course to the new falls. So you can now walk down the old falls canyon. You can see the years upon years of water against rock fighting against each other.\"The falls are magnificent in their splendor. Viewing and hearing the sound of cascading water splashing downward and over the fallen rocks along with forming rainbows at just about at every turn, is breathtaking. Be sure and notice how the water, over a great number of years, has carved through the rocks. The falls are only about a 40 minute drive from Jasper and are well worth the visit. There is no charge for viewing or parking.\"\"We were travelling from Jasper to Lake Louise and had heard seeing the Falls was a worthwhile detour and it certainly was. Given the melting snow, the Falls were impressive to see.\"\"Beautiful place!Even on a cloudy and rainy day it was beautiful. I imagine it in winter how amazing it would be.Worth a stop.\"The Athabasca Falls are spectacular and definitely warrant a 45 minute stop while traveling the Icefields Parkway in Jasper National Park. They are memorable because of the erosion of the rocks along the sides of the falls.This is a very easy walk to see the falls from several angles. Signs explained the color of the water and the surrounding areas. If you were willing you could make an easy walk down to where the falls emptied into a large river. Handrails and solid steps made the time there a treat.this was a quick stop while touring and hiking. Short walk to beautiful waterfalls. Can get very close to feel the power of the raging water.\"June is a good time the melt waters are still coming, but not in huge spring quantities, all adds to the attraction. Take time to walk around and enjoy, away from the crowds.\"\"Too many tourists stop when they see the falls, thinking that's all there is to see. Keep climbing higher until you are at the top of the falls for the most impressive views and the roaring sound of the falls. It's also a great spot to have your photo taken or to take a selfie.\"Be sure to visit all levels of the fall. This is the best one in the park. Also go up to the ice fields on the east end. I highly recommend Jasper! They take credit cards. 9.80 CD for adults under 65.\"very nice easy walk and you already can hear the sound,coming from dry and hot California,it was so beautiful,we stay long time there.It was great, MUST SEE.\"Wonderful views on the way from Jasper to Lake Louise. Would recommend a stop over point at this area. You can walk easily to the waterfall for a great view.\"Pounding falls, misty gorges, interesting geology, wildflowers. Lots of photo opportunities, but watch all the mist on your lenses!\"Not the biggest falls by any means but the setting and the splendour of the falls makes it a spot not to missIt is so amazing the power water has on rock. The erosion from centuries of flow is very prevalent and leaves you in awe. Easy walk around the area and lots of parking. very glad we stopped as there are so many other places to stop along the way. No fee once you are in the park.\"Liked: views, great place to get some good pictures.Dislikes: too many people and a lot of dogs when we went.\"\"Impressive but busy. Parking was a major challenge. However, the spray from the falls was natural air conditioning on a very hot day.\"The falls are simply beautiful! Well worth the stop. It is certainly a place to stop and spend some time at. We were there for about 45 minutes.Having read reviews on Trip we decided to stop off to stretch our legs and it was well worth it. Only a short walk from the car park to see the full force in all its glory is s treatThese falls are some of the best I've seen. Unlike Niagara Falls they thunder through a rather small opening and then travel through a canyon with more falls and whirlpools before eventually flowing out into a wide river below. Make sure you walk all around as there are many advantage spots to view these falls. Just off the Icefields Parkway so very easy to get to.One of our favourite sites that we visited whilst in the Jasper area.Great torrents of water and fantastic viewing points where you can really experience the power of the water.Also an interesting opportunity to walk through an expired section where the water previously ran and a view of the river after the falls\"Visited here today and the river was raging over the falls. Huge amounts of water and it was a very impressive sight. Not too busy, good parking, easy access. Would definitely recommend to anyone on the Icefields Parkway!\"\"Each time we go to Athabasca Falls we get a sense of magnificence. The overwhelming power of the water, the etched stones from hundreds of years of pounding and the beautiful figures carved into the stone from the whirlpools continue to amaze. When you go, be sure to take the side paths down to the basin. Most of the visitors only go to the lookouts so taking the paths less travelled will truly take you into the past and allow you to enjoy the pounding water and otherwise total silence of this lovely area.If you have children, please be careful to watch them closely as there are lots of access points that would be easy for the children to climb and fall over. Your children will, as those we watched during our visit, be amazed and curious and love the fact that they have to yell at their parents to be heard over the rush of water around them. Enjoy!\"\"Athabasca Falls is on the Icefields Parkway about a half hour out of Jasper, and if you're driving that way, you must stop there! They are phenomenal. It's only a two minute drive from the highway and a five minute walk after that. Someone has out a lot of care into the boardwalk and bridge over the falls. The trees have been cleared just enough to give you great views from all sorts of angles, and they've attended to your other senses as well, with one little nook where the roarnif the waterfall is amplified and another where you can stand in the spray (try it, it's fun!). Things are well-marked (the sign at the start of the trail down to the base of the waterfall even reminds you that you will have to come up again!) and well-maintained. We loved it!\"\"Lots of parking despite arriving at peak time (11:00)Still plenty of places to look at the falls.Well placed educational plaques\"Beautiful the colour of the water and the power of it was amazing.Worth the walk enjoyed just watching the water in such great surroundingsGreat trip onto the glacier by bus. really a must do. Had fun getting up and personal on the glacier\"Amazing falls, but take your insect repellent as you will be eaten alive.......oh and watch out for Japanese tourists that have expensive cameras with huge lens, they virtually take up residence.......they have come a long way for their holiday snaps!\"Wonderful Water Falls -- it stands out as one of the more spectaculat sites of this spectacular parkThis place is a must to stop in Jasper. The falls are huge and beautiful to see. There is also a path that leads you to see corners and hidden places. Sometimes is gets busy specially on summer time.It was an easy walk from car-park on made footpaths. The volume of water flowing over the falls was immense with the recent snows melting. Plenty of great photo opportunities from each side of the falls. The reminder of a fatality on the seating showed how dangerous the falls could be.\"Beautiful, large glacier. It's a quick stop and then a bit of a hike if you want to get a nicer view. It's quite windy, so I'd wear a jacket.\"Pictures can not justify the beauty of this place! Loved it. Be careful and don't fall over - they will never find your body in all that whirlpool at the bottom. Other then safety precautions - this place is amazing. Loved the stairs - so cool. We were camping and took a trip to check out the falls. A must see in Jasper. xxGreat stop on your way up to Jasper. We didn't have time to stop on way the Icefields Parkway but made sure we stopped on our way back to Calgary. I glad we didn't miss it. Very pretty. Make sure you view the Falls from all the different viewpoints.\"It's difficult to tell what is more beautiful in The Rockies Mountain, everything is a breath taking view wherever you go. This fall is amazing like every lake and Avery corner of this park. Super paradise!\"This is a must if you are in the area. I think these must be the most gushing falls on the Icefields Parkway. Be careful - access is not easy in places as the path is slippery and there are steps. But it is certainly worth the climb if you can manage the steps.\"If you're a nature-lover, a visit to Athabasca Falls will not disappoint. There are several view decks on a well-designed walkway.\"\"Only a short drive outside Jasper. We visited in early June, well before the heavy tourist season. It's amazing to see the power of the water and you can feel the ground and lookouts tremble from the flow. No complaints here, but I could see the lookouts, trails and bridges being very crowded during high season.\"Lovely views and scenery. Worth a visit and don't forget to take your camera. High volume of water when we visited. Would recommend a visitGreat stop along the road. The river is gently flowing until it roars over the falls plunging into a deep canyon. There are locations were the water has swirled and eroded the rocks to create 'pot holes' and there are many locations to view various portions of the river and canyon. Easy trail and rest rooms available.\"In normal circumstances these falls would be a must see but, as there are so many wonderful sights along this route, you need to consider whether to include this. Preferably youu should and allow at least 30 minutes for your visit.\"Well worth stopping at the Athabasca Falls. Amazing how all this water snakes its way down the gorge. Easy access. Fantastic scenery. Our day was all the more amazing by having a rainbow appear above our heads in a photograph!\"A must see if you're in Jasper! It's set up really well to view the falls and there are a few different paths you can take to see the lake etc. Really beautiful, I would love to go back again! Great view of the mountains as well.\"We particularly enjoyed the sculptured potholes and the rock formations created by the force of the water.Seeing these falls was an amazing experience. Be careful not to miss the turnout because it is not very well marked. The falls just roar through the rocks and then you can take a quick hike down to see where they come out into a wide river that is a beautiful silt-filled blue.Absolutely beautiful. It is a must stop on the way to Jasper. (About 20 min. from town of Jasper. Gorgeous area around the falls with walkway. Perfect picture taking areas.\"Just of Hwy93 - free parking, washroom facilities, easy access to viewing areas. The falls are quite small but very dramatic. The walkways let you see the falls from different viewpoints and they are wheelchair friendly too.\"\"Great location to view the incredible change in the river from fast flowing to thunderous waterfall. I think the early explorers must have had some fear when they saw the mist from the Falls as they were approaching this feature.Make sure when you have seen the Falls and if heading back to Jasper, you take the old 93A back. This is the old Icefields Parkway road and can offer some incredible wildlife and scenery if taken later in the day when the temperatures are cooler.\"A tourist stop on the Highway between Jasper and lake Louise these falls are well presented in that there are good walkways so you can see and enjoy the falls\"Easy access from car park, and the best waterfall have ever seen. A must do for travellers to this area.\"What can one say about this incredible falls. It winds through the rock formation and forms swirling cul-de-sac like cuts in the rock. A very good place to visit in Jasper National Park.This is one of the popular stops on the road between Lake Louise and Jasper. Its only a short walk to the falls which are quite spectacular especially as it was mid-snow melt when we visited. There are great pathways and bridges so you can check it out from various vantage points. A red squirrel wasn't worried about the bus load of other tourists around. We also had a chat to the National Park rangers who had an educational display near the car park.This is one of the prettiest falls in Jasper. The intricately carved slot Ravine just across the bridge at the Falls is really a sight to see as well.\"We visited in June and the water levels were very high. The falls are stunning and you can get a variety of views from in front and behind. Allow at least 30 minutes.Not to be missed, if you are anywhere near.\"Beautiful water falls. Steep in areas. Nice pathway. Need to keep close eye on children while visiting.Nice waterfalls. We did not walk the entire path but waterfalls deserve a look. These falls are close to Jasper.\"Definitely worth stopping off for 20 minutes en route to Jasper. Compared to Johnson Canyon it is a brief and easy (five minute) walk from the spacious car park to get the best views of the falls, and at 6pm on a Friday evening was not too overrun with tourists. As others have said, photos do not do it justice. The impressive thunderous noise, the spray, the rainbow effects created, the marvellous rocky and forested backdrop, the milky white Athabasca River - it's energising and inspiring - and so accessible (for able bodied folk). Just be careful with the steps further along the trail which lead down to the river. They can get muddy and slippery if it is/has been raining. We arrived just after a heavy downpour and had to watch our step!\"A nice stop and a ahort walk to the falls. Not overrun. To get there use the less busy 97A. The walk is an easy 1 km stroll along the falls. You really get very close.\"The falls are located in a lovely park setting with clean restrooms, picnic areas and a short walk to view the falls from several different locations, all stunning....a very nice place to stop for a rest....although be mindful of bears.....and it's free!!!!\"The roar of the falls and the movement of water in the air cannot be captured by photos. These falls are definitely worth a stop. Make sure you take the time to walk the well paved paths to above and below the falls. Parking was easy and we were lucky enough to be there when there were no tour buses so we had plenty of space to enjoy it. I also marvelled at the beautiful rocks and trees. We spent about 30 minutes there and had had plenty of time for photos and walking the paths.Worth the stop as the falls are amazing & incredibly beautiful. Short walk from car park & worth a break as the force of water is phenomenal. Very beautiful too.Crashing falls and a great walk around the area easily accessible with plenty of parking. Well worth a visit.\"Athabasca Falls are one of the main tourist attractions on the Icefields Parkway, Hwy 93, between Jasper and Lake Louise. Access is very easy from the highway. Parking is freely available. The paths to the main viewpoints are wheelchair friendly, although other paths are not suitable. The size of the falls vary with the season, in June with the snow melt and runoff, the volume and speed of the water is spectacular. The paths are well fenced and very safe for all the family.\"\"You must stop by these falls they are so pretty and so close to the road, as well there is a parking spot and rest rooms there\"\"The Athabasca Falls are small but a powerful, picturesque waterfall. Athabasca Falls is not known so much for the height of the falls (23 meters), as it is known for its force due to the large quantity of water falling into the gorge. We viewed the falls safely and photographed it from various viewing platforms and walking trails around the falls.\"\"A lovely rustic location. The falls has several bridges and a few walking paths. No interpretive facilities. Plan to be self directed and definitely observe all safety signage and guard rails. Bring a nice camera. Also be sure to check in out in the winter, the frozen water makes amazing patterns.\"\"A short walk from the Icefields Parkway, a beautiful, powerful waterfall roars down the mountains. When the sun hits the spray, viewers are treated to a beautiful rainbow which is easily captured in photographs. The view is captivating, and if you can tear yourself away from this view, the trail continues on for the more fit and adventurous.\"Stunning with lots of trail walking opportunities. Falls were very accessible and it's possible to sit by the steams\"This was such an amazing sight. Our children loved it and our driver had some great stories about this waterfall that really captured our children's imaginations. Seeing this waterfall from several angles is a must. From one angle, the water falls in such a way that it creates an stunning rainbow. We loved this!\"\"This area is beautiful! And without all that icky tackiness of Niagara Falls! The parking lot is big. There's washrooms (well, outhouses, but whatever, they're outdoors). One washroom door was busted with no lock so beware! It was raining when we went but still good to see. The cement pathways are uneven and as a result, water from the rain made huge puddles keeping us from walking everywhere. But hopefully you get to go on a nice day where this isn't an issue! There's a lot of mist and the temperature drops a little!There are boards all over providing educational information regarding the falls and the pot holes. You can walk through a cavern-like part which had formally been battered by the same water from the falls many, many years ago. You can look at the walls and marvel at the might of the rock and the force it endured. The pothole was interesting too...but looked a bit gross what with old, stagnant water being in it. You can keep walking down some very steep steps and get to the river where we seen excited people start rafting. I wouldn't recommend doing this when it's raining like we did because of how slippery and narrow it was. There's fences all over and past warnings not to leave the designated areas, because it's both dangerous AND destorys the environment by destroying the rocks and grass! There was a bench in memory to a young 21 year old man who fell off of those falls to his death. I felt it was a heartfilled gestured by his loved ones and a good reminder to stay safe! You must check this place out. It's a mighty falls despite not being as big as Niagara. I can see why so many love it!\"Highly turbulent water in a massive volume from the Athabasca River. You need to watch your step and stick to the path as this place has claimed the lives of those who took risks. Well worth the visit.\"Where do you start. Trying to describe the sound of the thundering water and volume of water that is cascading over the falls is near impossible. Just stand there, watch and listen.This is the power of water as the river funnels into a narrow canyon and down between the rocks sending up fine mist sprays.The park is easy accessible by car from highway 93, south of Jasper. Take care to follow the pathway and don't cross the fences as it can be a very dangerous.This is a must see on your Canadian Rockies adventure.\"\"Because it was such a short distance to the falls, I wasn't expecting much, so boy, was I surprised. These falls are very impressive. You can stay with 95% of the visitors and feel very claustrophobic viewing them or you walk walk a little ways and get a different view and less people. You can also walk downstream a ways and see the immediate calmness after the falls. It is a great little stop. Don't miss it.\"You need to see how the force of the water carved out the stone..amazing! Loved the beauty of the waterfalls and the power it generated.\"Pretty much a must see if you are in the area. Spectacular view and great place to take a lot of photos. If you are there in the early a.m. make sure you use mosquito repellent, the mosquitoes are thick.\"\"Athabasca Falls is a very pretty waterfall and canyon close to Jasper. It’s a short walk from the parking lot to the falls, with a couple of views of the Athabasca River along the way, flowed by a nice view of the falls. Then you reach a bridge across the river below the falls, and three viewpoints of the falls on the far side of the river. Finally, there is a trail to the lower canyon for better views of the canyon itself. We spent an hour here, enjoying the view and taking photos and could have stayed longer. Note — there is no running water or drinking fountains here, so come prepared!\"\"For some reason it is hard to describe what makes these falls so interesting, the thunder of the water, the sheer volume going over the falls, but this is one of the places you must see in Jasper.\"\"These falls are beautiful! A great place for a walk to stretch your legs, an easy short hike from the parking area. We loved how accessible these were.\"\"Worth a visit, if you're on the road it's a stone's throw from route 93, and everything is right there. There isn't really a hike just different bits you walk round/different angles to look at it. Then if you go down you can meet the lake at the bottom which is very pretty.\"\"We loved these falls, more spectacular than the swapta ones. Beware of the mosquitos though there were many!!!!\"\"Its just a couple of minutes walk from the car park and totally worth the effort, the falls are powerful and simply stunning.\"\"What an example of the power of water. As the river funnels into a narrow chasm in the rocks, it thunders over the falls, sending up a spray, and creating rainbows.\"Every time I visit Jasper I always stop and visit Athabasca Falls. Its beauty never ceases to amaze me. It can get very crowded so its best to go early morning or later in the afternoon. Definitely worth a stop even if you only have a few minutes.\"Love Athabasca Falls! Don't miss out on this one, just a beautiful spot of nature and a nice drive to get there as well!\"Beautiful canyons and falls just a very short easy walk from the car park. Go early to avoid the crowds a must see.\"Athabasca Falls are all about the raw power of nature! Just tons and tons of water smashing down below!There are numerous paths to explore the area, but like Maligne Canyon the water is the reason you visit!\"It is just off the main highway and it is definitely worth a stop. Can view the falls from both sides of the river. Also made a trip down to the water's edge. The path down was cut by water long ago and it was an awesome sight. It was an easy walk up and down although there was a warning sign about the number of steps down.Athabasca Falls is worth stopping for. The power of the falls and the immense canyons will take your breath away. Just wonderful.Beautiful and powerful! There was even a rainbow in one area of the falls! A definite must see on the Icefield Parkway!\"If you like waterfalls (I do) then these falls are not to be missed. Not huge, but quite spectacular, with a lot of water going over them. About a 200m walk from the car park, so not far to walk on firm tarmac.\"\"The falls are just beautiful! It is a nice place to walk around, great scenery. Definitely worth a visit.\"\"How can anyone give this 3 stars as average? It's really impressive and well worth a visit as there is a lot to see. We drove from Banff to jasper but went on the glacier and skywalk tours so did not visit the falls on the way up. Once in jasper we went back, about half an hour, to see the falls and I'm glad we did it that way as we could appreciate them more.\"\"Athabasca Falls and its canyon makes an extraordinary site. Come and get impressed, inspired by the force of nature. I've been here a couple of times and always I have the feelings of wonder. The park is easy accessible by car from hwy 93 South of Jasper. There are pathways around the waterfalls and steps through the canyon for you see this monument of nature from different angles.\"Nature at it's most powerful. The roar of the falls is a great reminder of the strength of Mother Nature.\"Just a short drive from Jasper, with a bear sighting on the way... the falls are beautiful. Easy walking around, well worth a visit.\"Absolutely spectacular - amazing scenes and breath taking views - there is nothing to dislike - unique once in a lifetime experienceWhen the water is running this is powerful sight to see. Parking is close by and the walks to the falls are easy. Great place for pictures and exploring the falls.\"An easy walk from the parking lot, Athabasca Falls is so beautiful. The National Park Service did a great job creating multiple view points and angles for watching the falls. It is well worth the time to stop and make this little walk. This is a stunning waterfall.\"Beautiful falls by Jasper. Very scenic and a lovely place to visit. I would highly recommend it - make sure you bring your camera.Just another wonderful experience on our trip through the Rockies. This was enhanced by the wonderful bus driver and company\"This is a not miss attraction, the rush of water was beautiful and noisy, and although I could not walk the full walk what I saw will remain with me\"\"About the only thing that keeps this site from being a 5 star is the lack of information and history of the site. The entrance to the Falls is well marked. There is plenty of parking. The majority of the paved paths are easy for anyone to move over. The grade is relatively flat. However, there are steps and some unusual rock formations in the outer areas that could challenge folk with unsteady legs/feet. But, if you don't have problems getting around, I can highly recommend you explore the path that follows the river until it flows into the wider river...about 100 yds.Certainly a place to see on your way to or from Jasper!\"\"Not the biggest or best, wildest or wettest but it is a great example of where a big river hits rock and cuts it way through creating a torrent. If you are in the area it's a must do stop. Watch out for Mosquitos in lower river area\"We were overrun by rude Asian tourists who insisted on forcing their way between my camera lens and the falls.When travelling on my Canada trip with my mum abs sisterThe visit was on my own tour just gif info from research and went for itDid the trip to Canary coach to Banff 2 days then coach to jasper 2 nights before our rocky mountaineer to Vancouver\"The falls were awesome. I am a big fan of waterfalls of all varieties. Since this had water that was falling, I thought it was pretty cool.\"A good falls with canyon like rock formation... close to the highway and must see for Jasper visitors\"Athabasca falls is a great little walk with big rewards, these fals are easy to access and would be great for families with kids or mobility reduced people.\"Really worth the very short detour off the Icefield's Parkway. Great viewing platforms giving a wide range of views of the Falls.\"I have been to Athabasca Falls numerous times throughout my life. It never gets boring!This spot is great for anyone. You can view the falls from the top, and if you're more agile, walk down the stairs to the river at the bottom. There are a couple of trail heads from this site, so look ahead to plan your day. Remember to have fun, but respect the signs and fences; don't end up dead for the sake of a picture.\"\"Athabasca falls is very beautiful and the drive out to the falls is worth doing on it's own. Like many other places in Jasper there are informative signs everywhere, helping you learn and understand more. The facilities at the falls were well kept and clean. Also similar to most places and things to do in Jasper, there were lots of people there. Because of this, I would recommend going earlier or later in the day.\"\"A very pretty spot, but stay in bounds, dont be dumb and die. Easy access and a beautiful walk fun for all ages.\"\"This beautiful falls are just on the way between Jasper and the Colombia ice field. great place to stop for a break, enjoy the nature and even have a picnic there. you can find a lot of parking, tables, washrooms and great atmosphere , and it's all for free.\"\"I've always liked to gaze at natural waterfalls, and this one certainly didn't disappoint. There was a series of concrete pathways that afforded numerous views of the falls and surrounding areas that made for some great photography opportunities.\"Great falls and great beauty. Follow the rules. Stay off the rocks. People fall in and die. It is an easy drive from Jasper proper and we go frequently.My sister and I visited Maligne canyon on a recent visit to Jasper. The view of the mountains behind the falls will take your breath away. Very easy hiking and most is stroller friendly. Great hiking trails through the forest as well!peaceful relaxing great place to take photos bring bug spray and please stay on the paths there are fences for a reason make sure you check out all the trails\"My wife and I along with 8 friends boarded a Raft and experienced the rapids. We didn't have to do a thing, the young man who handled the navigation did it all single handedly. The \"\"rapids\"\" weren't nearly as bad as I thought they might have been, but that doesn't detract from the skill of our young person. I enjoyed getting sprayed, others, not so much. Great fun, great experience.\"\"This a must see if the raw power of nature is what you an to see, great place to take that one of a kind photo!The earlier in the year the better the falls will be as the amount of water going through this area is more in the Spring than in the fall,but at any time this a great place to spend time.Take care to follow the pathway and do not cross the fences as it can be a very dangerous place to any one not acquainted with the power of water. So be careful and enjoy one of the true wonders of the Canadian Rockies!\"Another of those sights when you visit The Rockies that make you say wow! Well worth a visit. This was just one of the places we went to on our trip and I'd recommend this to anyone visiting Jasper National Park. The colour of the water is amazing.\"This is a must see on your trip through the rockies!Absolutely stunning!The water is such an amazing colour and the sheer force of nature creates that amazing rushing, pounding sound that's a little scary and a lot mesmerising!\"\"An amazing sight as the lake water pours over the rocks into crevices and caves. If you are lucky enough to be there without 500 other tourists, you will enjoy the sight-seeing and photography.\"\"Great to get out of the coach and walk around, great photo opportunities and a good cafe on site. The falls were still frozen from winter, so we didnt see it at its best\"\"Beautiful at any time of year. Gets very crowded in summer so visit in Spring, Fall and Winter if you can.\"A must see if you are visiting Jasper Nation Park!! So beautiful! You can be standing right over top and make your way down to the beautiful lake!\"Glorious waterfall pouring into a narrow rocky defile. Good for families and the disabled. One of the park's highlights, so bound to be crowded during the peak season.\"\"Really a beautiful short hike around the Falls and worth the drive to see, about 40 mins outside of Jasper.\"Outhouses were ill equipped; water level was very low at the falls; the mountain nearby was great for viewing & photography.My 21 month old daughter loves it here. The waterfall is beautiful and the walkways are pretty cool. Will visit again in the future.\"Great stop for photos and walk along the river and edge of the falls. Always some idiots climbing over the railings to walk on the rocks - very dangerous. There have been fatalities, Restrooms on the site for the mid-way bladder break.\"We were on our way to Mt. Edith Cavel and the road there was closed due to construction so we proceeded to Athabasca Falls. the walk was easy and the sights were beautiful. Not as long as Maligne canyon and easier if you have mobility problems. Great for a short hike.We have seen Athabasca Falls on every one of our trips to Jasper. It is right on the main highway and thus easily accessible. It is very popular with tour buses and so we suggest going early eve or very early morning (before 8:30) if you want to be there without the big crowds. It is beautiful at all times of the year!It is well designed for viewing but be careful not to go outside of viewing areas as it can be slippery and dangerous. The little walk down to the lake is very nice in the summer. Bugs can be bad in the area so bring your spray. Totally worth a visit for anyone. Don't miss it!Quite spectacular small falls (nothing like Niagara!). Lots of rushing water; you could walk down to near where the falls fell if you wanted.Easy walk affords multiple views of the falls. We visited in spring so still a bit icy underfoot we did not walk to the lower part of the falls. Picnic tables if you wanted to stop for lunch. Although it is awkwardly situated close to Jasper after the icefields it is quite close to the main road and worth a stop.Easy walking for all on man made trail. Nice in winter and summer. Depending when you go the blue color of the water will be intense.\"Went there mid april, the weather wasn't too good, some parts were still frozen but we loved it. Very peaceful place since we were almost the only people there!Will definitely check it out again one day in summer!\"\"This is very close to Jasper and must visit. It is a good hike an walk and we spent an hour plus doing the loqer and upper falls areas. The views are gorgeous, great pictures, it is a few kms off the hwy on the icefield pkwy route. The lower falls allows u to hike closer to the river . The falls has water at very high speed.\"This is a place that should be seen. Take an extra hour and sit and relax and just enjoy. Great for families BUT extra care must be taken as there are some very dangerous areas . There is bench on the far side of the falls that was donated by the parents of a young man that accidentally went OUT of BOUNDS and over the falls. So keep a good handclasp on youngsters.\"Nice stop on the way out of Jasper, definitely get out of the car and take a walk! Access to falls , canyon and the river.\"a nice trail leads you to the falls that are stunning. The water was pretty steady coming over the falls and a ranger working in the area was nice and stopped by to tell us what it looks like in the spring time when the water shoots over the edge about 80 feet out! The falls were cool and the path to walk along was nice and has a couple bridges and places to stop and watch the creek. We found and put back a couple of neat fossils as well. A need to do if you are in the area!\"Had A great afternoon drive & adventure from Jasper. Falls were very nice. Quite a few crazys who were going RIGHT up to the edges though. ..There we No warning signs that we saw on the east /parking lot side. But on the west side there's A big sign warning people of what Not To Do & even a Memorial bench for some silly guy who died \"\" Trying to be cool\"\" Sad.\"While driving the icefield parkway for sure stop to see this waterfall. You've a great five on the waterfall from different spots and if you take te steps down you can see the canyon too. Only takes about 30 min to visit.\"We went in mid-April and there was a ton of ice, but it was still beautiful. Seeing how the water has cut a canyon out of the rock, and the power of the rushing water - beautiful! Definitely check it out!\"One of many 'Must see's' in Jasper National park. The way the rageing river cuts through the narrow rock gorge to the calm emerald green lake below is a wonder to behold. The falls were partly frozen which added a new dimension. Add the stunning scenery and the picture is complete. We spent about an hour there as we happened to be passing but it was well worth the stop.\"Lovely place for a nice stroll, heard that its even more beautiful during summer and could get very crowded\"\"On our way home from an extra long weekend in Jasper we decided to stop and check it out. Was definitely worth the stop. Very impressive, a must see if you are in the area.\"\"Take the road closest to Jasper rather than just turning off the Parkway. It will take you a little longer but there's lots to look at on the way. The falls are beautiful, take the time to see them from all the viewing areas....and don't forget your camera\"If you are on your way to Jasper stop off at the Falls absolutely gorgeous and just a short walk from the car park... definitely a must see on route.\"Wonderful walk, short easy walk to the falls, you can choose to continue on, and walk the trail down to the lower river\"\"We visited Athabasca Falls at the beginning of April 2015. It's easy to find as it's on Icefield Parkway Highway 93. All the attractions on this highway have clear sign but when we see the sign it's quite near such place.The waterfall was nice but if we get there in summer, it should be more beautiful. Recommend to visit.\"\"Was easy to find, and lots of parking. Toilets were available.The walk was relatively flat with a few steps here and there. The view points were good. There are information boards along the route with good facts.\"\"We stopped at Athabasca falls to check it out, definetly worth the stop. Anyone and everyone that enjoys scenery will love this and really... everything around Jasper. We had an amazing trip. Looking forward to coming back to do lots of biking and hiking.\"\"One of our first stops on our road trip Jasper to Calgary, on fabulous Highway 93 - Icefields Parkway. A great waterfall, what beautiful scenery, wonderful experience, a must stop.\"I lived in Jasper for awhile and have been to athabasca falls many times. Summer and winter. Its free to enter although you have to pay to enter the park. Its well maintained with spectacular views! Lots of parking area too. The only down side is it gets very busy during peak season. Still worth checking out.This is just barely off the highway and worth the stop. The views are amazing and the trails are well maintained. Bring your camera!\"You should definitely stop here during your drive. It is a short walk to the falls to see the breathtaking beauty. A lot of the trail was icy, but you can still get to the falls and enjoy the scenery.\"\"These falls are always an amazing place to visit. Beside the falls the views of the canyon are stupendous, the walkways are slippery in winter so choose footwear with good grips.\"We visited in early April - roads on approach were clear and easily drivable. The actual waterfall was absolutely breath- taking! There is a clearly marked trail which was very save. It was a little icy - but the hand rails help to steady us!\"We visited at Easter. A little bit of snow and ice on the ground - if you're unsteady on your feet - it's not a good idea to venture beyond the main falls. The trail is not too intrusive, plenty of info boards and the path blends with the scenery. Our kids (8+5) loved this break from the highway and couldn't believe their eyes. Visit the falls and canyon beyond it. Incredible.\"The falls are easy access from the carpark and there was lots of water so falls were quite spectacular. There were a lots of steps down to a viewing area but the gradient meant it wasn't too bad getting back up again and I am very unfit so most mobile people should be able to cope with this. A must see sight to visit.\"Very fun place to take the kids to because it's loud and kids love waterfalls. Beautiful surrounding, well worth the stop.\"\"This is an often missed gem. I got the very best photos I have ever taken of waterfalls. You can get so close to this beautiful waterfall. Starting off flat at the top, you can walk down the stone steps, following the path that the force of the water has carved out over time. Many different vantage points for great photography. Gentle walk along the waters edge. Just brilliant. An absolute MUST SEE if in the Jasper area.\"\"Worth stopping by, nice and easy to locate, awesome view, stunning rock formation, beautiful in all season, great to see the falls - such heaven!\"\"Tours are closed to the falls in the winter, but hubby & I ventured out ourselves. Super easy to get to, 5 min walk from road, and totally worth it! Even when frozen they are still breathtaking.\"\"Awesome, try to check it out during the off season before june and after sept to avoid the large crowds and buses! Great place to see bears. Make sure you check the whole place out not just the first 5 minutes.\"\"another set of falls worth stopping for, they aren't too far off the highway and worth the few minutes for a walk around and experiencing\"\"This was our last stop before we went directly into Jasper for dinner.After all the amazing beauty of the Icefield Parkway, this powerful waterfall was well worth the 30 minutes of parking and walk to the outlook and bridge across the waterfall.It is a must stop and see - really not a lot of time needed to see an amazing natural beauty. The spray is continuous and its easy to get soaked depending on where you stand just from the powerful water coursing through and over so many areas of the rocks.\"We had a great time at the falls. It was a great stop after a long day of driving through the mountains. We walked around for an hour. I have never seen falls that big before. My teenagers enjoyed it too.Absolutely beautiful and breathe taking! Its amazing standing on the bridge in front of the falls and feeling the power of the falls! so cool! :)\"impressive falls and canyon. We try to take these in everytime we travel on 'The Icefields Parkway'. Also take in the Mountain Goat look out and Sunwapta Falls Lodge with a very good dining area. We also took in the Jasper Skywalk, absolutely awesome engineering.\"\"#1 - bring crampons I cannot stress this enough. I almost fell about 100 times, and I saw no fewer than two tourists destroy their cameras by slipping on the ice. #2- if you have been here during the summer you will find the falls are totally a different scene in the winter. They are majestic, and somehow frozen all the way through. It is really beautiful.\"\"It is approx 40 km from Jasper town site, travelling south on the road to Lake Louise.. The roads were clear and no ice or snow. The turnoff is well marked and the walk to the falls doesn't take very long. It was icy in spots so be careful . The walk to the falls is beautiful even in the winter time. It sure gives you a different perspective as to what nature can do when you see the frozen water. The parking lot is ploughed and there are outhouses. There is no cell phone service out here. Well worth the trip.\"\"What a wonderful place. We stopped in at the falls while in the Jasper area skiing at Marmot Basin. There was a lot of ice on the pathways, but with care we were able to get around to all the viewpoints. The falls looked really nice in the winter ice. Definitely worth the visit.\"Beautiful place to stop for a picnic and to gaze in amazement at what nature can do. Inspiring to just sit and watch for a while.\"Stunning water falls in Jasper! See the power of mountain water flowing through huge rocks and crevices!

Directly off highway. No charges. No food, etc.\"\"We always stop at the fall. It's never the same. Don't drive by!Bring something to eat and drink, but clean up after yourself. You are in bear countrySame for pets and kids! Keep an eye on them!\"Amazing viewing platform and great information posted around thefalls it is a must see on the way into jjasperWe saw it after the ice had melted so it was in full glory. Worth going to see but you need to walk down there to appreciate them. Mix with the Maligne Canyon walk\"Well signposted off Highway 93, and a short walk from the car park. Although the drop is not big by waterfall standards (23m drop), it is the amount of water that is forced into a narrow gap that makes for a spectacle of sight and sound.\"\"Beautiful falls. Shouldn't miss it because it is very close to Parkway, and a very short and easy trail hike. Nothing strenuous.\"The sounds of the water flowing and falling is enough to make Athabasca Falls a place to visit. The rock formations are huge!The rainbow you see is also a bonus. Our kids were amazed to see this marvel of nature that is the Athabasca Falls.\"Easy to find off of a map! Short trail! Beautiful scenery! We went here in the winter and it was breath taking so I can't even imagine in the summer! It was a nice small activity to enjoy, the falls were beautiful and the mountains superb as ever!! Really enjoyed coming here :)\"The Athabasca Falls is between Jasper and Lake Louise and Hwy #1 Hwy #93 crossing by. Amazing water Falls. Just have to walk there.\"You don't have to be there for long to get great views. The trail is short, but the falls are breathtaking.\"\"Very impressive waterfall with walking paths. the nice spots for taking photos are always filled with mist from the fall so a go-pro or something else waterproof you can quickly wipe down is the way to go. If you have a choice of time for the visit, early morning or later afternoon are best as during the day, this place can be super busy and you have to focus more on not to bump into people than the massive falls.\"Fabulous scenery. So dramatic! A must see. If you can fit it in it is not to be missed. Look for bears.\"We stopped at Athabasca Falls en route from Jasper to Lake Louise. A boardwalk takes you along the river from where the rapids begin to the thundering torrent that is the main attraction here. Along the way, you experience many vantage points and photo opportunities. Tour was by SunDog, excellent driver/commentator, nice clean little transport.\"Oh so beautiful. You take a walk down and just the size of the trees and the sound of the water gushing/rushing is so incredible.\"Really impressive don't miss it.Can get busy but walk along the tracks further up the falls and it's less busy\"\"we went as part of a snow mobile safari and stopped off here as part of the whole day trip, which included breakfast and a superb buffet dinner at the end, with coffee served from a huge enameled pot - just like in the westerns on TV.\"This thundering waterfall is amazing to see. Free to visit and just off the main Jasper-Banff road. Thousands of tonnes of water pouring through a narrow neck in the river. Worth a look!\"Spectacular waterfall viewing just off the Icefields Parkway, near Jasper. This small hiding trail is easily accessible for those who are not able to manage longer hikes.

There was a lot of water coming down over them, and the canyon it has created was quite pretty!\"Important to see this. Spectacular and many nooks and crannies to explore. There is also a pleasant walk above the falls.I have been here many times and never get tired of it. Very popular place for tourists and tour buses so it can sometimes get a little crowded. Great location for photographs.\"Athabasca Falls is just one stop on the Icefield Parkway. A winding road stretching from Banff to Jasper. An amazing route thru the glaciers where you can get up close with these natural wonders. Take a walk up on a glacier, dip you hand in a fresh glacier fed stream. Some of these streams, including the one of the Athabasca Glacier collect and flow thru the Athabasca Falls. It is amazing to see. Dress warm, this water does not get warm even mid summer. A must see.\"\"The Athabasca Falls are definitely worth a stopover on the way to/from Jasper. It is amazing to see how the force of the water has carved thru solid rock to form the falls, and the canyon below.The trail is easy to negotiate and located not far from the car-park. It leads to various viewpoints and allows views from different aspects of the raging falls. If you choose to walk a little further into the trail, you will come to a viewpoint where you may be sprayed with water, depending on the time of year you visit.\"\"Plunging at a height of 23 metres, this powerful and picturesque waterfall is simply magnificent. Standing at different viewpoints, you can feel the strong force of nature with a close encounter of the loud roaring sound and the blue turquoise water splashing into the deep gorge.\"\"You drive up to an unassuming parking lot wondering if just beneath the surface lay something worth stopping here. You head up a paved trail and you find yourself greeted by one of Canada's most secretive treasures. In what seems like the middle of nowhere (unannounced by anything more than a modest sign that screams: \"\"There is absolutely nothing to see here\"\"), rests something wonderous that will have Christians and Evolutionists reheating the debate because what you will see is inexcusable! This kind of natural beauty can be captured on film and digital media, but to understand the true essence of it, you simply have to be there!\"\"Very lovely natural landmark. They've built in some excellent pathways that allow for different angle views of the falls, and that lets you get close enough to feel the spray and hear the roar.\"\"The blue/green river, the waterfalls and the mountains beyond were spectacular. There were several paths you could take to see the falls from different angles.\"This is a must see if you are the Icefields Highway. It's a nice way to take a quick break on the long road. The falls are a once in a life time visit and the glacier blue hue of the water is stunning.\"These falls were worth stopping at, powerful water lots of good photos. The glacial water was wonderful with rainbows & gushing water. Watch where you walk as it is dangerous\"\"Dont drive there just to see this. If it's on the way, you may spend some time. Nothing exceptional about it. You can find better places.\"a nice rest area with a nice waterfall. would be way better in the summer than in October after some hard frost but a nice walk around none the less.\"If you are a nature lover , this is one of the places to visit for colorful waters surrounded by rocky terrain\"It was a beautiful day and there are a lot of spots to take good photos of the falls and rushing water!We started our journey on the Parkway with our first stop at the falls. They were beautiful and the power they have is amazing. We were there early and beat the tour buses to the site. There were a lot of people visiting but they have several spots to view them and see the power of the water on the rocks around them. This is a stop you must make.\"All around here is stunning, you could some it up as trees, water and mountains, but that would not give credence to the awesome views.\"\"We went in November and it had just snowed! It's not a gigantic fall but with the snow it was so lovely. The water was actually turquoise too.There are alot of paths around.\"\"We visited the falls very early in the morning as the sun was rising, and would definitely recommend going at that time - the falls are absolutely stunning and we got some amazing photos. Very accessible from the car park and well worth a visit.\"\"After you've seen the falls, look at the size of the river upstream or downstream and try to imagine all the water going through the narrow waterfall\"A spectacular falls which is easily accessible from the carpark. Lots of water rushing over the boulders and down into the valley.\"Close to the main highway, these falls are awesome, especially as they seem to burrow into the stone below. Lots of places to take a good photo and the glacial water makes all look extra beautiful.\"\"It's a lovely full-bodied waterfall, mini-Niagara. It is easily accessible for great views, and there is an option to descend to the bottom of the fall through amazing rock formations that look surreal.\"\"very powerful waterfall, even at the end of Sept. Can only imagine what it's like in May with the spring runoff\"\"Very pretty falls, offering some walking trails down to the river as well as the main falls themselves\"\"Yes indeed, this is worth stopping for. Lovely lake and amazing mountains are the backdrop for an really powerful waterfall. Lots of different viewing platforms with interesting stories relating to the falls.\"A breathtaking view of waterfalls and the sounds of nature This is a major stopping point for most tours and for a very good reason.A truly spectacular photo stopYet another beautiful scenic experience well worth another bus break.different view points to capture the most of this waterfall . We were so lucky with weather.although a popular tourist attraction worth the crowd - most are accommodating when needing a photograph!!\"Definitely is a must to stop by. Beautiful waterfalls but the best time to go when its quieter and less people, then it makes much more special and place to visit. Great spot for photography. Highly recommend it.\"\"Be sure to walk all around to get all perspectives - very beautiful. If you see a lot of buses in the parking lot, try to change when you go to view - gets very crowded at the best view spots\"Easy parking and well signposted walks along the falls. Care needed as paths can be slippery. Beautiful and a 'must visit' site in the Rockies!\"A nice falls which are easy to access from the highway. It really only takes a few minutes to see the falls. This area, however, does see a lot of tour bus and general traffic. If you stop, you will encounter a large number of people. If your looking for a peaceful, little spot near Athabasca Falls try Honeymoon Lake. My favorite spot in Jasper National Park is the Mount Lady Cavell area. It's located about 30 minutes or so from Athabasca Falls. If you have a little time, you may wish to take the scenic route to Jasper down Highway 93 A. You'll leave a lot of traffic behind and there's some nice scenery along the way. Also, Mount Lady Cavell is located just off 93A.\"Our tour bus briefly stopped here. It was a little disappointing if you have seen numerous waterfalls in the past. This is more about the volume of water going over the falls than how the falls look. If you're strapped for time give it a miss.Yet another beautiful 'must see' site in the Rockies.Make sure you see all of it and cross under the road. Mother Nature at her very best.\"The falls are nice and, because they’re right off the highway, are definitely worth a look. However, depending on the day and time, you could run into a lot of people packed into a tight little viewing area.By all means, get up close to the falls and get your pictures and all that. But also make some time to stroll on the worn paths alongside the Athabasca River. You’ll get away from the crowds and the scenery is unreal: the glittering river rolling toward the falls, with the sharp peaks close on the horizon.If you have a half hour to spend here, I’d recommend taking five minutes to snap a few shots of the falls, and spend the rest of the time walking along the river. For me, the falls was the appetizer and the stroll along the water was the main course.\"\"Visited the falls in September 2014, easy access to see the falls for the disabled, beautiful scenery.\"\"A great stopping place with falls, rivers and walkways. Well worth a stop and good photo opportunities.\"\"Stopped to view falls when driving between Jasper and Banff and were pleased we did. Located very close to the main road they provided a pretty spectacular sight, especially as the waters had not really been flowing very strongly in many other locations the strength and power of the falls was very impressive.Well worth breaking your journey to see.\"Driving between Lake louise and Jasper is arguably the best drive in the world with OMG moments all along the Icefield Pathway. The Athabasca falls is another of these moments. Very glad we spent time visiting all these great places including Athabasca Falls- don't miss itWe decided to stop and check this out. Sooooo glad we did. Words and pictures cannot describe how beautifully magnificent these falls are.\"Lovely walk beside this roaring, powerful river. I enjoyed walking down the steps in the old canyon, and seeing the rock formations on the canyon walls.\"\"Stopped off to visit Athabasca Falls (30kms from Jasper), just off the HWY and well worth seeing. They are not too spectacular but they just take a minutes to get there from the motorway. The entire area is quite scenic.\"Easy to get in and out so definitely stop here. Free parking in the lost and very well marked trails for different perspectives.\"The parkway seems to go on forever and there are so many great sights to see, so it is tempting to pass a few bay. But I recommend you dont miss this very pleasant stroll to see the lake and the falls. I was just looking at my videos and photos from my canada trip last year and remembering how lovely the falls were to visit. Especially when you have been driving a lot in the car. It is great to get out and stretch your legs in this lovely area. Just a short stroll from the car park the walk ways are well kept and there is easy access to walk around the falls and see the lake. Great views of the falls and signs with pictures and information let you know lots of information about the flora and fauna. The wildlife is never far away. We were able to sit and watch a squirrel as he sat on a branch in perfect Tufty poise with his tail curled up his back.\"It's very beautiful. The glacial blue water in the summer is of extreme beauty. Can spend hours on a bench just listening to the rush of the waters or walking down only 100 meters to the calm end of the fall\"Kind of busy with the bus tours and all, but worth a stop on the way to or from somewhere. Stroll along the path to get away from the camera commandos and high heel and bear bell crowd.\"\"We did a tour from jasper, with sundog. The guide was very good, just enough information without overload. The falls are beautiful. Worth the walk don't forget your camera.\"A delightful stop! Beautiful view of waterfalls and potholes that the rushing water makes. Aqua water falls off like an infinity pool...a really amazing experience and walkway....definitely a must! A highlight of the Jasper area.Great falls and many good viewing platforms. Get there early if possible so you keep ahead of all the bus loads.We just happened to pull into to Falls while traveling from Jasper to Banff. We are so glad we did! There are lots of easy foot paths to walk on. You can easily get to various points of the falls. There are lots of informative signs. Take a few minutes to walk down through the rocks where the river used to flow.Just beautiful. Make sure you walk down to the lower canyon. You can walk right up to the waters edge. Gorgeous views there!A short hike from the parking lot will take you to the falls. Great viewing locations of the falls and surrounding mountains.Nothing to dislike about this site well may be the toilets are primitive. The falls are amazing and very photogenic!\"This is a stunning waterfall even when the river level is low, but not the best in the area. Alao be sure to go to maligne canyon and Sunwapta falls which is just further down on the Icefields Parkway be sure to go to the upper and lower falls..\"An impressive amount of water over the falls even tho' it was at the end of summer. A free attraction and we walked all around the falls and in the gullies for about 3/4 of an hour.\"We had a quick stop here, but it was long enough for a photo. There were toilets too, but not much else.\"We visited these falls while we were staying in Jasper and loved them. We would definitely recommend a visit as they are stunning and probably even more stunning in the spring when the snow is melting and adding to the volume of water passing over them.\"Took a guided tour of the ice fields, fantastic experience and top class information from our guide, a must do experience especially if you are interested in the environment and effects of Globalisation.\"\"One of don't miss sights along the Icefields Parkway, a little outside of Jasper. The paths are all paved and you can view the falls from both sides. It isn't a particular \"\"big\"\" waterfall, but a forceful one as can be witnessed by the carved out rock.\"\"Best waterfalls I have ever seen, very calm and soothing, well worth the trip and little walk/hike. Loved the chance to be able to walk down to the river and feel the cold blue/green water, very beautiful\"I enjoyed a quick stop at this falls. It was near the parking lot and well worth a stop to see the falls and canyon.Well worth a visit. Major photo opportunity and well managed site with amenities. Just a nice place to hang out and spend some tie watching the World go by.\"Having had many deaths over the years at these falls the authorities have been very sympathetic in applying health and safety at the site. True the railing do detract from the natural beauty and sort of shepherd you around but when the rivers in full flood then these falls are not only spectacular but also frightening for the faint of heart.That said, we were mesmerised by the beauty and the sheer power of the water as it made its was from a gentle undulating flow to a destructive torrent in about twenty feet.There is a full walkway that allows you to see the first part of the falls from both sides and they are simply stunning. For those more adventurous there are steps that take you all the way down to the river basin with a few off-shoots along the way - the majority of it all is extremely photogenic and I would whole heartedly recommend it to everyone in the area.\"\"If you're in the area, travelling along the Icefields Parkway, then a stop off at the Athabasca falls is a good idea. There is no entrance fee, and plenty of free parking. Access is very good on foot, and the falls themselves are interesting to see: there is an old dry section where the river has diverted naturally, and the effects of the water flow on the rock formations are clearly visible.\"\"A short stop for those either in or out of Jasper. Right off the hwy. This isn't a hike as all the paths are paved and easily accessible. Some of the views at the bottom as the lake trails off into the distance is breathtaking. The waterfall is beautiful, if perhaps a little \"\"touristy\"\", but with that allows families and everyone to enjoy the magnificence that is the Rockies in a safe environment. Recommend.\"Fences line the whole route. For good reason as have been a number of deaths but feel it has taken away the naturalness of the area. Good sight but better in the area.\"A free place to visit just 30km out of Jasper down the Icefields Parkway. Definitely worth a stop. Not a \"\"big\"\" fall but its design is interesting and the platforms allow you to get very close. A worthwhile 30-minute stop.\"Thundering water and just off the highway and well worth the stop. Walk across the bridge to the other side for the best views.Beautiful water falls set in spectacular scenery. A short stroll around to see some fabulous geology.We had a lovely walk to the falls and read all the information supplied on the boards in the area. Would have liked to have stayed longer but we were with a group on a coach and so had to be back at a certain time.\"we did this hike and loved it even though the weather was rainy and on the cool side. it was crowed, but we were there over a holiday wk end. Since it is spread out, I didn't think it was overly crowded, BUT others did.\"\"A beautiful experience, awe inspiring. We always go back here when we are in the area. Well worth the drive.\"Just a short walk from the carpark and good stop off point on your trip along the spectacular Icefields Parkway near to Jasper.\"Easy to find, clean toilet facilities for travellers and the most stunning waterfall. I would tread carefully following rain as the steps could become quite slippery.\"\"Loved Athabasca Falls. We were there on Labour day so it was a bit crowded but with patience, you could get a good view and take lots of pictures.There were also lots of washroom facilities available. Would have been a nice spot to stop for a picnic.\"The falls were not far from Jasper. They were an easy walk to get to as well. Every view of the falls was another photo opportunityVery nice set of waterfalls. A couple short trails to see the upper and lower falls. Interesting lookouts over the falls. plenty of parking\"As a friend said; touristy but worth it, Large fast flowing falls just near the car park. Just have to hope you manage to avoid the tourist busses.\"\"Excellent. There is a nice walking trail, so allow some time for that. Series of bridges, deep gorge, impressive.\"\"We pulled off the road on a whim after we saw the waterfall sign. What a find! We stayed over an hour exploring, walking the many trails, and taking tens of great pictures. And, it's free! Wear good shoes for the walking and make a point to know where you are (and where you left your car!) We got disoriented a couple of times with the many winding trails. A truly gorgeous falls and close-up water views are amazing!\"\"The low clouds, light drizzle, sound of the roaring falls all made for a spectacular experience. Not to be missed.\"These falls although not high are fantastic. The roar caused by the water winding its way through the rocks is incredible. They are on the main route between Banff and Jasper and should not be missed.Impresive. Very impresive. Grat place to hike and many photo opportunities. Great paths between huge rocks. Easy accessible. Well worth to visit. Free car park.What's not to like about gushing water over age old rocks and into deep canyons. Beautiful scenery and well worth a visit.\"We stopped as part of a group so time was limited, a definite drawback. An early experience of the Rockies. The power of water over the years opens up a fantastic spectacle which is worthwhile taking a bit of time. Watch your footing.\"Most impressive to see and hear the power of the water which has sculpted the rock over the eons. Fortunately we were there when there were not too many people. Judging by the large parking lot it could get mighty crowded. Off season on a rainy day was perfect.We enjoyed walking along the edge of the river to the Falls and the Falls overlooks. It is beautiful.Getting to this location is an easy walk - rewarded by a gorgeous falls. Don't miss this turn off on the Ice Fields Parkway.\"This waterfall is very accessible, plenty of parking, and always provides excellent photo opportunities.\"\"An absolute must do, great experience, you are driven out onto the glacier in Big Cats, and given quite a bit of information by the driver on the way to the glacier\"Went here to take pictures. You need to try and get there either in the morning or anytime when it is cloudy. The tour buses make the place crowded. Great place for pictures.\"On our last day in Jasper area we took the drive out to Athabasca Falls. We had seen it before but are always in awe of the power of water in carving out rocks to form a channel. Walk was relatively easy even though it was drizzling a bit that day. Lots of good photo opportunities. We did, though, see some very stupid young males climb over the safety fence and stand out on the rocks. Attention getting? I'm sure they didn't see anything more than we did.\"\"What a wonderful experience, Fred our driver from Sundog Tours took us on an amazing journey to see this natural sight. Would recommend this to everyone visiting the area, it's not to be missed\"Pretty as a picture. Very easy access to the falls. Worth going to.............. Nothing more to sayloved to hear the rush of water and feel the spray. Lots of tourists. Really there was nothing we disliked as there was lots of parkingThe falls and the location are fabulous for a walk and sightseeing water and nature at their prime. Easy access and relatively flat walking if only the upper falls are going to be viewed\"Brilliant waterfall and then some! More and more waterfalls as river continues through ravine to lake beyond. Interesting walk down to lake through path of ancient river canyon. Interesting rock formations, plenty to see and photograph. Easy reach from carpark.\"Wear your waterproof. Lots of spray and lots of other tourists all doing the same thing. More like a giant plug hole than a waterfall. But worth the stopTruly amazing natural experience that took many thousands of years for nature to carve out of the stone and rock. The walk around offers many photo ops. DO take time to see this one.This is no Niagara but is a beautiful place. Make sure to take the short walk on the right hand side of the road opposite the falls. Stunning scenery and unreal colours\"Rushing water, great viewpoints, easy walk to get there. It was impressive even on a rainy, cold day. Lots of tourists vying for good camera shots.\"\"Although we visited in late summer, there was still enough water to be very impressive. The walk was easy & interesting. A must stop.\"Beautiful walks and wonderful photo opportunities! As with everything in the Rockies during the height of summer - go early to avoid the crowds and enjoy the peace!\"Gorgeous scenery, potholes, historic information along a beautifully man made path. Walk along the river to the falls, down to the potholes and through the old river where the rock won! Wonderful, picturesque stop toward Jasper.\"\"The falls were simply awesome and amazing! However, the bathrooms were dirty, smelly enough to choke a horse. The hand sanitizer was empty and we were very disappointed especially having to pay a fee to enter Jasper. One would think that the fees would also include regular maintenance of the washrooms.\"Athabasca Falls are one of those must sees when travelling thru Jasper National Park. It is not far down Highway 93 and worth a stop.Absolutely breathtaking. After paying $25 and being disappointed with the Skywalk we stumbled across the Athabasca Falls. It's beautiful and free!\"well worth the stop! It is a amazing and beautiful waterfall and the way it cut through rock is breathtaking. The only thing I can say is for a Thursday afternoon, it was FULL and hard to get around with all the tourists. I figured the middle of September and the middle of the week it wouldn't be quite so crowded. I was wrong...but it was still worth the stop\"\"Outside the town of Jasper but well worth the drive. Great place to go regardless of age. Good walking sidewalks, with rails. Some stairs. Great views.\"They look small when compared to some other falls. But once you see them you are in awe of them. Very close to the parking lot. The view from each angle is different. One has to go to all the possible view points to watch. Seeing this fall from so close relaxes the mind and gives a pleasant feeling.A worth place to visit.This is a must stop to see. It is just a few steps before you see this gorgeous spot! Walk up and down on both sides so you can see the falls and where they go as the water flows into a beautiful pool and river!\"Great little falls right off the highway. Nice paths to walk on, and wheelchair accessible. Definitely take the time to walk around the falls. The path takes you right near the edge where the water drops.\"\"This is a must stop, falls are beautiful and nice trails well done to walk around, easy to spend an hour here. there is really a lot to see. we were here in Sept and it was flowing really good with blue water, I cant imagine what it is like when the snow is melting in the spring. Make the stop\"The waterfall is easily accessible and impressive. You must go to both sides of it to enjoy all its beauty\"This waterfall is worth a short walk. Having seen numerous falls in BC, I liked the layout and pathways provided to explore Athabasca. Wish we went whitewater-rafting though!!\"You HAVE to stop -- if you are passing -- but there are lots of amazing waterfalls in Canada - things one is easily accessible form the main road\"The proof of the phenomenal power of water is amazing!There are a few stairs but could be fun for the whole family! Fantastic views of the falls and mountains!\"\"Just like any other falls in the Rocky Mountains, they are beautiful! The scenery is worth seeing and very accessible to everyone as they are a very short walk from the parking area!!\"The only negative thing was the wet weather we picked in May 2013. But the views and majesty of all those thousands of tony cascading down the falls was breath taking\"The falls are a very short stroll from the parking lot, which makes them accessible for almost everyone. There are a few stairs, however, that I don't think you can get around. It doesn't take long to stop, and the falls are worth seeing, but be prepared for a crowd.\"\"When you pull into the parking area at Athabasa Falls, it doesn't look like much. Just a shallow, r rippling river... but you can hear the roar of the water, and that draws you along to the walkway and on to the bridge crossing the raging, beautiful falls. There are many paths, signage bearing interesting facts about the area, a tonne of photo opportunities.Don't miss the lower tunnel, where the river once ran. It's labelled the Time Tunnel, and the rock formations are amazing. Continue on around the bend to the right for a stunning view of the now-calm waters of the lower river. If you are only planning to travel as far as Jasper, this is definitely worth the extra drive!Note: We were there at sunset, very few people around, a gorgeous sunset added to the ambiance!\"\"The trail is easy, not much elevation, people of all ages can do it easily. It has some stairs( sometimes slippery), so stroller carriers, think before you carry it. The igneous rocks have been cut by the falls water, and that looks great. It could take 1-2 hours easily if you do the entire loop.\"\"we stopped on route from Canmore to Jasper and the falls were well worth a visit. Beautiful scenery and not a difficult walk. although Sept still coach parties around so I am not sure how busy it would be in high season, but still worth visiting\"\"Waterfalls and water in general is as hypnotic and tranquil as fire to us crazy human types so no wonder we all love seeing water come crashing thru rock channels and pooling up before dropping again. We walk through these trails and lose track of time as we're hypnotized as we stare at the raw beauty of water...showing rock whose the boss...lolBeautiful, free to all, and kids will love all the climbing and jumping...don't miss it\"This is the second time seeing this and it was well worth a repeat visit. The scenery is magnificent\"It gets very crowded here so be prepared. Pretty little falls. Make sure you walk down to the water and see the canyon. It's a short steep walk, but you get a different perspective.\"It is a beautiful sight for all the senses. A don't miss is the short trek through the lower end to a lake and lookout. Beautiful pictures. You could climb up and just take in the beauty of the Canadian Rockies\"The Falls are very pretty adn the hike there and back is quite enjoyable. with some bends, curves, and switchbacks along the way.\"\"A must see on any trip around Jasper. Like elsewhere within the park, informative signs, well marked trails and routes.\"Good walking tours follow river and falls with various outlooks for picture taking. Geology and mountain vistas.The canyon the the falls runs into is as inspiring as the falls. The walk to the falls is short and easy.A must for all visitors..... Useful information boards explained what you were seeing and why.....just fantastic!\"The other reviews are spot on, this is a can't miss spot. There is a very short walk, not hike, on pavement, to the perfect spot. Just do it.\"\"This was a great stop on our first day travelling to Jasper. The falls were beautiful. There is a nice walking area around the falls and down to the river, lots of Photo opps.\"\"During the busy Labor Day weekend, this was the only place where we felt claustrophobic (in our days visiting Banff, Jasper, Lake Louise, Icefield Parkway over the days during and around the weekend). People were shoving, rude and it was really hard to enjoy the beautiful waterfall!\"There are levels of walking for everyone - near or farther. Some rough spots. Such a beautiful spot!We have been here several time before so it has become a regular when showing off to visitors. The falls are stupendous. So much power and nice easy walks.\"Absolute must see!! Words cannot express the power of these falls. I was very impressed with the greatwalks and viewpoints and informational plaques. I have been here many times and am always amazed.\"\"This is a definite must see for anyone who is traveling between Jasper and Banff Alberta. The toilets are outhouses and although as clean as an outhouse can be, still smelly. Concrete walkways and bridges make for easy access for able-bodied people. Unfortunately there are steps that would prevent wheelchairs accessing the beautiful views. Set aside at least 45 minutes to an hour just for a quick look around. On the occasion of our visit there was a Parks Canada staff member with information setup about various animals, and she was showing animal pelts [I am sure these animals were not killed by Parks Canada staff solely for demonstration purposes]. I have never had the opportunity before to see the size and feel the fur of these various animals. It was a very positive experience. There is no gift shop or any other trappings. I believe Parks Canada has tried to keep this beautiful spot as pristine as possible given the large number of tourists that come by every year.\"\"You must stop here, you won't regret it. Amazing little place with a huge wow factor!! The power of these falls is awesome. Can get a little crowded so I would get there in the morning.\"\"worth the stop, river flowing into falls and canyon below. Nice tourist area right off main highway to view fall, with outdoor facilities\"Sheets of spray billow off the milky white water plunging over the falls into the narrow gorge. There are several points on the paved path to get great views and pictures. All this just a short walk from the car park.\"Excellent well worth a visit, get there early as parking can be quite limited and it is very busy at times, the falls are spectacular so don't forget the camera.\"\"Try the Rafting Adventures - it's great fun and good for all the family, from 6 years old. Safe but exciting!\"\"The falls are situated in approximately 30 kilometers of Jasper. The site is charming, the debit of water is impressive. The arrangement is easily accessible and walks very well in a fitted out path. To see absolutely. There is however a lot of people.\"\"At first sight they looked disappointing, but further in the falls were absolutely breathtaking. Not just the falls, but the carved out rock they have created over the years\"\",\"Athabasca Fall is right by the highway. From the parking lot we did not need to walk much to reach the fall. It was nice walking around the fall and canyon.\"This is great, give yourself some time to really walk around, it's well worth 45 minutes, there's not just the falls, but the canyons, pot holes and the serene lake\"Beautiful location but extremely crowded if you get caught up with the organised travel groups. Make sure you get their early or later in the day when the tour buses have moved on.One of the many sights along the Icefields Parkway and worth the stop. Nicely presented and maintained by the Parks authority.\"Athabasca Falls, by far, is one of my favorite spots in Jasper National Park. The beauty just surrounds you from all sides. It's a must see for sure!\"The falls were absolutely breathtakingly powerful ....you can also take a walk along the river ......going down through the rocks there isn't that much to see - so avoid if you have issues with mobility - but Definately take a walk over the bridge to experience the power of the falls - feels like it's rainingAwesomeness. Great for a stop to stretch the legs. Very pleased and very scenic. Great photo opportunity. A few trails around to explore. Toilets. Picnic areas.\"What can you say about something like this, it amazes me every time I go there, following the trail gets you to more views and more falls!! it is nice and it is close to Jasper.\"\"Even in winter, with frozen water, this fall is a sight to see. Great photo op and paved track so can be accessed even in winter.\"nice break to take a walk and a few pictures. Amazing how much water has passed over the rocks and carved out its path.\"A great sight, even if you've seen a waterfall before, this one has it's own unique features. The best part is probably the small hike down to the river bottom where the falls calm, so tranquil and beautiful. There tend to be a ton of people at the falls, it's nice to take a few steps away and get away from the crowd down below.\"I didnt expect to see such a big water fall in Alberta! Definitely must see for any nature lovers. When we were there it was pretty gloomy and raining but we still had a good time\"It was quite crowded when we arrived and had to wait for a few people to move before we could get pictures without strangers in them . The falls are pretty but make sure you cross the pedestrian bridge and follow the trail to the right , under the road's bridge . You walk thru a small abandoned canyon and there is a fork in the trail . To the left leads down to the river's edge . To the right takes you to a beautiful overlook of the river leveling out and a beautiful rock escarpment . Nature has really worked it's magic here with the beautiful contrast of colors between the rock and the silty river .  Everyone has their own interests but I literally would stop here again just for this view .\"\"I loved this gem! Amazing scenery that can take your breath away. I will be coming back every year! A must-see. Great, light walking for someone like me with a double knee injury; the paths are easy to walk and perfect for families.\"\"Wonderful to look at and enjoy, there are various viewing points you can walk to. Really enjoyed this place.\"\"you have to walk on stairs but it is worth it.Make sure to reach the other side of the falls.You will get wet but the view is well worth it.Do go down to the lower canyon.\"I've been here many times and in many different seasons but am always delighted by these beautiful falls. Usually quite crowded in summer time but worth the stop; can easily spend 30 minutes here crossing the falls and going down the path to the base of the falls.\"Nice waterfalls, but a waterfall is just a waterfall.Stop, look, take a picture and move on to the better stuff!\"\"Although less popular than Sunwapta Falls, Athabasca Falls was quite beautiful to see. Wider than some other falls, it is a nice stop while driving to Jasper or Banff.\"\"The place is spectacular, with a fantastic view over gorges and fall. We hear very well the current of the river to bounce on cliffs. Is worth seeing. There is however a great deal of tourists, often incapable to wait and which put themselves in your way at any time to be photographed.\"\"A waterfall viewed from the top. Only a short, easy walk from the car park. An unusual view and one not to miss.\"\"Wow the water flows thru here fast, you must make a stop to check this out. The amount of water travelling thru the rocks with such force was incredible to watch and a great walk thru the rocks down to see where it all ends up in the lake. You only need a half hour stop to check it out and it is worth it.\"Only a short walk from the car the falls are spectacular. Although popular they have real atmosphere and well worth doing the trackes around and about to make the most of them.\"The falls were fantastic to view, the history and beauty are something to really take in. Walking along the falls is a really great experience and good exercise as you climb the stairs\"\"Easy walking trails lead to serveral vantage points of these spectacular falls. Stand on the trails below the falls and feel the cool mist, great on a hot day (be sure to cover your lens)\"\"The sounds alone will astonish you! Water currents and geological erosion come to a head here when you stand before the awesome energy of Athabasca Falls. Though the cascade is not as vertically pleasing as most falls, the power and flow-width of this direction change and drop in elevation of the river makes you aware of it's displayed, ever present energy. Stopping to hear and feel the mist on your cheeks is worth every minute.\"\"If you are in the Jasper area, be sure to take the time to go to the Athabasca Falls. It is a beautiful natural area where you could spend much time just soaking in nature's bounty.\"\"I liked the informative notices that Parks Canada has posted there, explaining how the falls are receding up the river over time. It is a great spot for photos, as we say a rainbow over the falls.\"The park service did an excellent job with the many interesting viewpoints of these beautiful falls. Very much worth the stop.\"Certainly worth the stop, but it was very busy when we were there.. I think there were 3 busses in the parking lot. I picked up a bag of garbage that someone had just dropped in the middle of the path and put in the garbage bin only 50ft away... how can some people be so ignorant?\"\"Athabasca Falls has to be seen. Impressive. Visit both sides. Take your time. Maybe the right side is more impressive, you could reach the border of the falls\"Was a lovely spot to view the force of the river and falls. Great nature lover pictures. A short distance from the highway and well worth the stop to see the canyons and falls in the river.\"This is more than a waterfall. Take the time to walk all the way down and around to the bottom Look at the walls, potholes, the little alpine gardens, and of course the rushing water below you. This is a waterfall to be appreciated up close, and slow enough to appreciate some of the finer points. There are plenty of informational boards to help explain this unique place.\"We hit up the Athabasca falls after decided to drive through the parks on our way from Golden to Edmonton - glad we did. The falls themselves were just breathtaking but I was also impressed by the trails around the falls - nice to be able to walk down the old path of the falls etc.Another spectacular natural wonder in these great parks. Quite the falls and rock formations. Don' t drive by - stop and see these falls. As always if you want to see them without the crowds come very early in the day and you won't have to elbow anyone out of your photo spot.\"Best falls in Jasper, hands down. Spectacular and so powerful! Well worth the stop and short walk to get right next to the falls. DO NOT MISS THIS!\"This is a must if you are travelling from Jasper to Banff. It is a quick jaunt off of the highway and is just beautiful! Definately worth stopping for a bit and enjoying the sights!\"This is a beautiful stop on the drive from Banff to Jasper and even better because it is free. Nice bridges and walking paths with very safe railings allow you to see the falls from many angles. This falls is fairly high, but more of an attraction because of the volume of water going over. Easy walk for those with limited mobility to see parts of it - a few stairs to get to other viewpoints.\"It's a spectacular waterfall. There are several spots from which to admire its beauty. Easy access. Don't miss it.\"Stopped here on the way to Banff. The Falls are amazing. So much water. When we were there, there was a stunning rainbow above the Falls. It woudl be a crime to be in the area and not stop here IMO.\"\"As all of the other reviews have stated, these falls are exceptional! You can spend a long time just looking at them in awe! Definitely worth a visit.\"It is amazing that the rocks survive the constant pounding of the water. Really worth seeing. Easy trail and steps to see the falls top to bottomI could have spent hours at these falls. Very easy access right off the Icefields Parkway. Guiding paths allowed viewing from all angles. Definitely a place to visit.\"Make sure you stop and see this, so beautiful. Lots of tourists but its normal as its so beautiful. I stop here when ever I am in that area.\"\"The Canadians love their parks and can be legitimately proud of Athabasca Falls. It is easly accessible and because of bridges, you can see the falls from many vantage points. This is a \"\"don't miss\"\" if you are in the vicinity of Jasper\"From a gentle surface to the canyon formed by the falls shows the power of nature. Short treks can also take you up and downstream a bit for further viewsThe falls were amazing. The color of the water is beautiful. We just stayed and watched the great gushing of water and enjoyed it so much. A relaxing break from a hectic trip!\"...you could elude the ever-present overcrowding. Face it, anyone who visits Banff/Jasper/Yoho/Kootenay all visit nearly the same time of year. The crowds in the well-known areas are going to be overwhelming. I still have to say, though, it most definitely interferes with your ability to absorb what otherwise on an uncrowded day would be a lifetime experience.That being said, the falls are beautiful. Parks Canada has carved out a beautiful path to view and to descend to the beach, where you are able to depart on a white water rafting expedition. The falls would be an incredible experience if you could enjoy them in a less-crowded setting. My suggestion would be to try to get here very early and see if the experience is different.Parks Canada has also done a great job with the placement of informative markers so you can read the historic elements of the falls. I simply wish I enjoyed viewing things with 1000 of my best friends.\"Good for a quick stop. 15 minute viewing of falls so close to the road. Big parking lot. Buses will be there about 8.30 so leave Jasper before 8 to be ahead of the crowds\"We & our kids enjoyed being able to see & feel the falls as well as explore around the area. It was beautiful. FYI though, this is not stroller or wheel chair friendly.\"\"Not just another falls, very impressive to see and hike around. Wish we had more time to do the trail down to lower view. Saddest part was seeing memorials to young people who didn't stay on trail, and were lost down the falls. Watch the kiddos! And hope you don't mind using park pit toilets\"The power and force of water is visually displayed at these beautiful water falls. The water carves through the canyon. It gives one pause and demonstrates power.\"http://www.jasper.travel/content/athabasca-fallsDon't pass this by. It doesn't look like much from the road, but has several vantage points for spectacular views of the waterfall and the interesting erosion patterns. I found it to be one of the best waterfalls I have seen due to the surrounding scenery and erosion than for the falls.There are boardwalks, decks, concrete and stone steps, and paved rams on which to walk to view the falls from different vantage points. Be sure to walk around the corner at the old falls to get the full effect. There are a lot of steps, perhaps 100 altogether, so be prepared to be tired if you are not accustomed to steps/stairs and altitude. You cannot negotiate strollers except at the very beginning. Some of the steps and walkways are wet, so I would recommend good walking shoes with rubber soles rather than heels or flip-flops.My bus tour was only there for 30 minutes, so I had to hurry to go to the end and back in that time. If you are on your own with no time constraints, I would allow about an hour here. It is quite crowded, but the photo ops are splendid.\"The falls are beautiful and very easily accessed. The walkways allow visitors to experience the falls (and their power) from several different vantage points. Very cool.\"By all means, this is worth the time to pull over and explore. We walked the entire boardwalk and were blown away by the volume of water and forces created. The mist in the air made for fantastic photographs. Highly recommend it. You won't be disappointed.\"\"These falls are close to the highway and so are worth a stop off during your drive up or down the Icefield Parkway. We spent 35 minutes here, walking to see the falls from the different angles possible, and taking pictures but you could have easily spent longer as we were very quick. Whilst we saw many different falls on our trip, I would definitely recommend stopping here. As others have said, here you see the awesome power of God and his creation. It's just amazing to stand and watch the power of the water. Truly amazing - a wide, calm river and the power it has on the rock as it falls. It's interesting to walk down the passageway to see the canyon and river below. Where you walk, is what once was a passageway for the water, a long time ago and you can see where the water has carved patterns in the rock over time.\"Just a short hike from the parking lot takes you to a thundering waterfall (more like a really big dangerous rapid) and a deep cut gorge. Just off the Icefields Parkway south of Jasper.\"The falls are easy to access, which accounts for its suffocating crowds. I guess I would rather hike to a less crowded waterfall. Otherwise, it is one amazing, majestic sight as the river cascades lower.\"This is a must see stop. Its not a long walk at all and well worth it if it was. It shows the awesome power of God and his creation.\"Athabasca falls is certainly a MUST while visiting Jasper National Park.the main falls are close to the road, but if you wish to enjoy the full experience, take the short well-maintained trail to the bottom of the little canyon, where the falls open up into the river.The sheer power of the water thundering down the falls is very impressive.The water-carved walls in the little canyon created by the falls are beautiful to walk through.A great experience for the whole family.We loved it!! So will you!!!Don't Miss It!!\"A very short walk from the car park to a stunning set of waterfalls and a great example of the forces of nature at work as cuts through a deep canyon to the floor below\"This is probably one of the most impressive, definitely in terms of its water force. Just a short walk, and you get to look at it from different angles. You even get to feel it as it sprays over the viewers platform. Wonderful.\"\"This was a beautiful stop. Short and very easy. Handicap accessible for a good portion of it. The part that is not handicap accessible is a very easy path to hike. The falls here are lovely, great picture spot! Many visitors stop here, it can be very crowded.\"Athabasca Falls is one of the must do stops in the Jasper area. It is a nice walk with lots of water. We say so many falls in Alberta and this was one of the good ones and worth a stop.The sheer power & force of the water flowing as it wends its way down from the top of the falls is an incredible sight! The vegetation & rock wall formations that harness the sideways flow having been worn away by the water have a strength of their own ! A must see when in the area.\"What a great walk to see what water can etch into a landscape. The path is easy and safe, the photo ops are brilliant. Well worth a peek.\"Amazing falls but I guess it has to be enjoyed by all. And I mean all! If you are lucky enough to visit between tour busses! The best time is probably early evening and when the weather is a little cool. Yes a must to see in Jasper!\"This is some kind of a fall, big, noisy and showing itself from all sides, with even a sport to refresh yourselve in the spray. Very interesting also because you can walk an old arm where the water left and see what it did to the rock. It ends down where the falls end up in the river, quite a nice spot.\"COOL AND REFRESHING with the spray in your face and so beautiful for photography. My fave place in Jasper definitely\"Enjoyed thoroughly the sound of the fall, cool air and majestic falling for water. Makes me wonder why man thinks they can be God? The fall was so magnificent.\"We stopped off when driving down the Icefields parkway. It was a good stop with some great views and with not much walking involved a good way to break up the journyThe falls are quite lovely and interesting. Be sure to walk around so you can view the falls and associated canyon from different directions. Excellent photo opportunities. Not a place to scramble around but very much worth seeing. Look for cross bedding in the sandstone all around and amongst the falls.\"We took the 1st road to the falls which is actually the longest road to the falls, but the scenery is worth it and there is virtually no other cars!! We were able to stop and get lots of pictures without worrying about who was behind us. Lots of elk grazing by the road. The falls are absolutely beautiful.....do not miss them!!\"\"Lots of good views of Athabasca Falls, but stay on marked trails. It is dangerous to leave them. Many different angles to view these beautiful waterfalls.\"Never expected this sight and the power of river water sediment carving bowls and canyons thru solid rock.Absolutley breathtaking beauty!! The Falls were magnificent and powerful. I loved my time there and would advice anyone going to Jasper to take the short trip to the Athabasca Falls.The falls were frozen when we visited them. The lake was free from ice. It was very beautiful. You should see this at least two times. Frozen and when the water crushes down. You have a lot of platforms around the falls for the best view.Nature is amazing! A short easy walk which is well worth it. Note the beautiful rock formations as well as the falls.\"Worth a visit, wear suitable shoes and go hiking around the park. Falls are great and rush through the blow hole. Plwnty of great shots for photos.\"\"Maximum view with very little hiking effort! We took many great photos, which didn't even begin to capture how spectacular it was.\"\"Athabasca Falls is not the most stunning sight, you will experience along the Parkway, but it is certainly worth the easy in and out visit. A very powerful falls, there is a series of walkways and bridges that allow you great vantage to see the falls, the pools and the power of mother nature. You can ease right off the road, there is ample parking to a short walk. Do it!\"\"Really impressive falls,quite mesmerising to watch! Plenty of information to read and lots of different view points.\"Very popular and thus relatively crowded. Easy walk from parking lot. Allow 30 mins to take in the views. Nice and cool on a warm day due to breezes from cold water. Plan clothing accordingly - particularly if it is chilly out.\"Very powerful falls, and well worth a stop if you're travelling along the Icefield Parkway. Good interpretation along the route.\"Another great stop on the icefields parkway. Easy to get to with paved walking trails to all the good viewing spots. Amazing views of the impressive falls from all around. Take some insect repellant though!\"Awesome falls, small walk and a nice stop point along the way. Kids loved the spray coming off and it is quite amazing to see. worth stopping\"Family of 4 and our dog visited late July. It was busy but no problems getting a parking spot. Beautiful falls. Great paths to walk and lots to see. There is more than just the falls. Be sure to go down to the river and sit for a while. My boys loved building Inukshuks down by the river.Our kids loved this stop along the Ice Fields parkway. The falls are pretty spectacular and there are many nice walking paths around the area to view the falls from different locations.Go early or late in the day to avoid the crowds else you won't really get to appreciate the natural beauty of the placeThis is an essential stop. A marvel of nature and easy to access. We were impressed by the interpretive panels that educate the visitor about the river and the falls.We have been visiting Athabasca Falls for the last 35 years whenever we come to Jasper National Park and it never fails to impress. The way the walkways and lookouts are positioned around the falls give great views of the sides and front of the falls. There are also many informational posts regarding the natural history of the falls and area.The Athabasca Falls are easy to access from either the Icefields Parkway or Hwy 93A. There is lots of parking available within easy walking distance of the falls and there are bathrooms at the site.\"We were here in the peak of summer and this was one of the most impressive feats of nature I have seen! There was a gorgeous double rainbow when viewing the falls from the far side - there were also fewer people there. We got there early, but 6 buses pulled up about 10 minutes later. One of my favourite stops on our entire road trip!\"A great place to have a leisurely walk and see nature at its most powerful. Rushing falls and potholes were a feast for our eyes. We stopped here on our drive on the Icefields Parkway.\"A very unique falls, so much power pushed through such a small area is rather impressive. Very close to the carpark so not a long walk at all.\"This is an excellent stop for anyone in the Jasper area. Gorgeous waterfall which can be seen from many angles.Quick accessible stop just short of Jasper if you are on the Icefields Parkway. We were happy to stretch our legs and were thrilled with the huge volume of water that passes through the Athabasca Falls every day. It is an easy path most of the way but be prepared to encounter lots of tourists.One of the most beautiful waterfalls in the world. A must see and very accessible. The rock formations and how they built the walking areas and stairs into the natural formations is amazing.\"We've visited many waterfalls, from Niagra to Multnoma. These were absolutely beautiful! Well worth the time! Be sure to view them from above and below.\"This is a one of the must-see falls. It was crowded when we were there during last week in Jul 2014 but the stopover was well worth it. Plan to spend about an hour or two. Apply Sun block and then spray mosquito repellent before heading into the falls area.\"it's easy to get beauty overload on the icefields parkway, there are so many things to see, one nicer than the next. we ended up seeing this on our way back from jasper to lake louise and are happy we stopped. just a very powerful and pretty waterfall that's an easy walk from the parking lot.\"We visited the fall on the way to Jasper. It is a easy well maintained trail and view is interestingBeautiful but busy in summer. Just like anywhere in Banff or Jasper so if you're going during the on season expect lots of people. Regardless it's worth seeing and snapping a picture of. Athabasca falls is gorgeous and is worth the stop.\"Beautiful falls with sunlit moss on the rocks, just an easy pull off from the parkway. Viewing platforms and a bridge make it a lovely photo opportunity and meditation.\"A torrent of water. Be sure to walk further down from the falls to see the water rushing through the rocks.\"Not too far from Jasper. Awesome waterfall and canyon, very informative panels as you walk around, beautiful as you would expect. Plenty of parking\"The path is well maintained and the views are terrific. There are informative signs throughout the hike.Fantastic scenery on the way Jasper. Ample parking and no entry fee. The falls may be small compared to other examples in Canada but the views are spectacular. Well worth a visit and you can be relatively quick if pressed for time or do some longer walks. Definitely stop and see.we went here to fill in some time before going on the float boats . it was a realy lovely place to visit and we all enjoyed the vews and watching the powerfull waterfall the force of the water falling into the gorge. easy to find only 30 kilometres south of Jasper and well worth a visit\"an easy and very worthwhile walk from the parking area, the power of the falls is palpable. as with most sites, if you get there early (before 9:30 or so), you can avoid the crowds, which greatly enhances the experience.\"We did the afternoon 3 hour guided walk on the glacier and I can highly recommend it. Our guide was knowledgeable and gave us plenty of insight into the formation and history of the glacier. It was a great experience\"An easy drive and so close to parking, a great easy walk with lots of interesting angles of the falls. Loved it.\"\"Do not be tempted to drive by this attraction! It is well worth parking up, despite the busy car park, and walking through the various pathways to see (and hear) the falls and consequent gorges.\"Definite stop! Nice walking trails to different viewing areas. I was on a bus tour so it was crowded but worth it.Took many photos here but hard to capture the power of the water. Again many tourists in July. But would not have missed this sight!\"Visited the falls twice, first time on our way back to Jasper from the Icefields. We thought it was going to be busy (mid afternoon) and we were not mistaken! Nevertheless, with a bit of waiting around we took the photos we wanted but gave up on some aspects as we planned to visit again en route to Lake Louise. As per usual, our second visit at 9:00 was just ideal, few people and a glorious sunny day so a permanent rainbow in the mist from the main falls - a real postcard moment and worth the early start.\"Fantastic scenery within a short drive of Jasper. Ample parking and no entry fees. The falls may be small compared to other examples in Canada but the views are spectacular. Well worth a visit.Wow what an amazing falls and the walk ways around the falls allow you to view from so many angles. we were there as the sun came over the mountains and a lovely way to start the morning.\"Breathtaking, fabulous falls we travelled in July and the amount of water going over was just breathtaking, make sure you go.\"Crowded but with patience you can get your shots. Don't forget to look around for mountain goats! Sun position not critical.Stopped briefly at the falls on a coach trip from Banff to Jasper. They are stunning! I wish we had had more time there.Visited the falls as part of our Brewsters Icefields Parkway trip from Banff to Jasper and they are quite a sight. The amazing river suddenly descends down the gorges cut out by the water over thousands of years revealing splendid rock formations and different colours.Well worth the stop to visit.\"These falls were our first stop as we drove south from Jasper. We found plenty of parking and it was an easy walk to the falls. There are many viewpoints for the falls, getting a different view from each one. There are a couple of viewpoints where you feel the mist. From one of the viewpoints we even saw a rainbow coming off the falls. Be sure you bring your camera!!! A must see attraction!!!!\"\"We were on a coach trip for three days, and one of the trips was to the falls and they were lovely. All my family enjoyed the visit to the falls.\"\"Stopped on the way home from jasper, plenty of parking there and it really only takes like a hour there if you want. There is a path that takes you over by the first falls and you can get soaked from the mist, also there are plenty of great vantage points for pictures of the falls from one of the many bridges! Do not miss out if in the area!\"\"The falls are quite amazing in the middle of summer when the water flow is at a peak. There are trails from the top of the falls, a bridge across the falls and then trails down to the river below. I soent a good 30 minutes walking around, you could easily stay longer\"All the waterfalls in this area are great and this is no exception. Go and visit as its great. Sometimes you get to see a rainbow over the water. Take your cameraDefinitely stop here. A very short walk and a very impressive view of the falls. A bit of a romantic areaA must stop outside of Jasper. You can get very very close to the falls and it is a great photographing opportunity.We were here on an cloudy/rainy morning after a major storm the night before. The mountains were still hidden behind a low cloud cover. The water flowing through the falls was white and heavy. Easy walk from the bus. I recommend staying on the established trails as some of the area is fairly steep. Lots of photo ops!We stopped on to way to Banff. It was really worth the stop. The car park is big enough and there are washrooms. It was very impressive. We really enjoyed the view. It was a rainy day so the flow was even more impressive. It is pretty noisy and you might get a little bit wet. It is only a 5 min walk from the car park to the falls. You can take a longer walk if you wish and see the falls from both sides.\"Excellent powerful falls easily accessible for all, including buggy's and wheelchairs. Thunderous sound of the falls and spray. Good parking within 100 metres more like 50 actually and so much better than Sunwapta. If you only do one set of falls in Jasper National park do these!\"The falls are impressive and worth the stop. Much more accessible than some of the other falls I've visited.\"Definitely a place to see. Short trails from parking lot w/ beautiful view on falls. OK, it's not Niagara, but very impressive too. We enjoyed this very much.\"\"This falls is right off the Icefields Parkway and is absolutely breathtaking. There are pathways that allow you to meander along its route a bit and see the falls from various angles. At one point you can stop and feel the mist from the falls. This was our second trip here, and it was as exciting as the first. This time we brought my brother and his wife along and they were as impressed as we were. As my sister-in-law said...\"\"I could just stay here all day and be happy\"\".\"\"Nice quick stop to get up close with a powerful waterfall and view the sheer force of nature in all its glory. Very easy access, even for those with limited mobility.\"\"Especially is you are not a hiker and do not get to see falls like this often. Super easy access, magnificent falls. It is busy though, try to go early to avoid the crowd ....\"\"We have been here several times, love the falls and the view! Well worth the drive! Walking on the paths is flat unless you take the path to the lake.\"The falls were beautiful. Very short hike from the parking area which makes for easy access. No charge. Many photo ops. Do no miss these falls if driving highway 93 between Banff and Jasper.\"First time visit and we were dazzled by the beauty of the falls and enjoyed watching some rafters head down the lake. Our youngest is three, so we had to by extra mindful of him, but the walk was great and the scenery incredible. We'll most definitely return!\"This has got to be on your list if you are 'doing the Rockies'. Make sure you walk to the end to see the second part of the falls.\"Very nice scenic location and short walk in that our elderly companions had no trouble with! I do prefer Maligne Canyon myself, if I only had time to stop in one place, Maligne is too difficult for seniors to walk as steep going on the way back up. So this is a nice alternative.\"Breathtaking. Be sure to take your camera with you and go right to the bottom to get the full experience.\"Quite nice, as always it is walking to the falls themselves that adds to the overall experience.Also by going to these areas it gives you the chance of seeing animals. We saw 3 deer.\"\"Beautiful Falls. Easy to walk on paved path for teens to seniors in our group. Reminded me on a smaller scale here to Tremmelbach falls in Switzerland, except these are free. Our entire group enjoyed this stop. Falls are short walk from parking lot.\"The falls themselves are spectacular but we also love to hike down to the bottom and take in the beauty of the lake!\"Fantastic experience, the falls were roaring again, every time we have visited we've been lucky enough to see a spectacular display at the falls\"Good stop off whilst driving along Icefields Parkway. Small falls with walk ways and viewing platforms. It took us about 45 minutes to do the whole falls. If you are making a special trip to view some falls I recommend Maligne falls which are stunning.\"Superb waterfalls with many viewing points. Worth stopping to visit, quite a lot of parking. Washrooms are interesting\"\"What with these falls and Maligne Canyon in the same area it seems you are spoilt for spectacular waterfalls and canyons. Nothing more to add-we too saw these falls as part of a Brewster ice field parkway tour to Jasper. Well worth a stop, although they can be viewed in 10-15 minutes.\"\"It was a bit of a hike for us +50's, stairs and such so it was great exercise, our little dog enjoyed seeing the falls lol. It was an amazing site to see!\"We weren't overly impressed to be honest. the falls are mighty and the setting is nice but still failed to hit the spot.To stand so close to this powerful waterfall gives you a true sense of the energy that powers through the gouge and valley. It makes it easy to see how the rocks have been shaped over the years.\"A must stop! Definitely go down all the way, so you can see what the water has done to the rock. Great pics when the weather is right!\"This was part of a Brewster tour along the Icefields parkway. Excellent photo opportunities and informative commentary. Information boards at site useful. Stunning falls!We loved the falls and took lots of photos. Saw this as part of a tour group. It is a must see.Was very voluminous with water from the snow melt.\"amazing view what natures provides all of us. well worth the drive amazing wonders of the world easy to get to, free to access,\"An amazing falls. You can see a rainbow almost anytime. There are many great views of the falls and a few short hikes nearby.Viewing these falls is awesome. Lots of great view points. Lots of room to manoeuvre around the crowds. Good parking. A great way to spend a few hours.Every stop is picture postcard around this area & the Athabasca Falls are no exception - breathtakingly beautiful !these falls are amazing so much water coming through such a small space. lots of opportunities to view the falls close up\"We had looked at the Bow River Falls in Banff proper and while they're famous for their appearence in the 1953 Marilyn Monroe film River of No Return, they're not exactly spectacular. I almost didn't care if we skipped these... wow, would that have been a mistake. The falls themselves start off with a steep plunge into a set of pools, so the sound of crashing water is impressive. There is a path around the falls and it is well worth it to walk to the other side as on sunny days there are beautiful rainbows (I'll post a picture of them) to view. They have moved the fences very close to the falls so you get very good views of the falls. The water swirls at the bottom so there are these cool circular pools carved into the rock. There are also several paths that lead down closer to the lower parts of the falls and bridges that allow for great photos. VERY impressive stop. One note.... numerous people were seen climbing the fences to get pictures closer to the edge of the falls and this behavior scared the pants off many. I was told several people a year go over the edge. I believe this is because the signs are only in English and French, and believe new signs should be placed in Japanese and Chinese warning to to scale the fence. You don't need these at ever site but this site has the potential for great danger. Just a thought.\"\"We stopped on our way back to Jasper from Maligne Lake. It was gorgeous! It's always nice to be able to cool off during the day when it gets hot and this is an excellent spot to do it! There is a trail you can take to the bottom of the falls and dip your feet on the water. There's also a spot you can stand and enjoy the mist :)Tips:- comfortable shoes! - take your camera and water- give your self an hour, at least. - please don't litter and stick to the trails.\"\"Not far off the Icefields Parkway, more touristy but worth seeing. The hiking areas were mostly wooden walkways, easy walking.\"The falls in the Canadian Rockies are known less for their size and drop as for the sheer power of the water rushing through narrow parts of the rivers. Athabasca is one of the best and just outside Jasper.We visited in early July when the falls were full and the water was rushing over the rocks. What a magnificent place! I could have stayed for hours!An easy drive and lots of wildlife in the area. The falls themselves are amazing and the river itself is beautiful. The trail is very easy and has some incredible viewpoints. You can even feel the spray from the falls.You must stop and see these falls. Unbelievable how fast the water is gushing through these very narrow and deep gorges. There is a walking track around the falls so you get a good view from different angles. It is just off the Icelands parkway.\"After the Athabaskan Glacier and The Skywalk, this was breathtaking as well. What a beautiful fall. Worthwhile to visit.\"Right off the Icefields Parkway and definitely worth the stop. The river drops through a short but deep gorge; paths and stairs let you see the whole thing from various vantage points. Enjoy the spray on a hot day!We could hear the roar of the water as we opened the car door. The paths to the falls are very well done. The falls are stunning. Make sure you have your camera. Would recommend.This is a must see if driving the Icefields Parkway. The falls are only a short stroll from the parking area and the trails offer great vantage points.\"It's a little bit outside Jasper, so it's easy to miss it, but it's worth the stop :it's quite close to the road, so very accessible !The power of those Falls is quite impressive...It might be a little bit in the shadows early in the morning so not so easy to take good pictures,I think around noun the sunlight might be better...\"I could't find the beauty of the famous Athabasca falls.. maybe wasn't a good day to visit it... but the water was extremely brown\"You can hear the roar of these falls from far away; once you're near, you'll be impressed by the sheer volume of water. Spend some time wandering and taking pictures\"Bring your camera. You'll want to take plenty of nature photographs here. I myself took 488 shots. It was glorious.Huge falls that you can easily spend hours enjoying and photographing. Make sure you go down to the abandon part of the falls.\"Great place to go , kids loved it especially where you could get sprayed with water!!Easily accessibleToilets were very smelly would not recommend to use them\"Great attraction near the Icefield parkway lends itself to lots of tourists so it can get a bit crowded. I suspect anyone nearby stops with good reason. One of the many must see places in the Canadian Rockies.Departing Jasper you will see Athabasca Falls on the way back down towards Banff. I did notice a bridge and a lot of mist while heading north but did not stop. On the way back down South I pulled off the freeway and it is a very short drive to the parking lot and an even shorter walk to view the falls. Definitely worth the stop to check out the falls. Beautiful (is there any waterfall that isn't??). One of the must see if you are visiting Banff and Jasper National Parks.\"We stopped here on the way from Banff to Jasper, this is one of the myst see locations near Jasper. Easily accessible from the car park so its a great location for families to visit. A short easy walk brings you straight to the falls. We walked across the bridge and had a different view of the falls. The spray and mist was quite something, almost like having a spray shower which the kids loved! Another short walk downstream brings you to the canyon view. The walk is interesting as it brings you down a flight of stairs that seemed to be carved out of huge rocks!\"\"Fantastic views, all around. Millions of years powerful currents carving stunning sculptures.If you are a smoker or enjoy littering, please have some respect for the nature & drive right past this spot.\"Awesome -amongst most spectacular natural phenomenon I have ever seen. Access and presentation excellent.\"A must see when visiting Jasper, great views of the falls from many different angles and vatage points\"Good car parking. If you can walk 200 yds and do 56 well maintained 30 degree steps down then up again then you can see the lot from all angles. Still worth seeing even without doing the steps.We did this as the first of a three stop day out of Jasper. Next was Sunaptra Falls then a trip down to 'glacier central'. On our trip we saw black bears (with cubs) at the roadside and mountain goats and of course amazing scenery.A good stop but perhaps a bit of a geography field trip stop rather than a 'wow' so don't base your whole day on it.\"We were told to see Athabasca Falls as a preference to Sunwapta Falls if time was limited. We did Sunwapta on the way to Jasper then Athabasca on the way back to Lake Louise. Athabasca Falls is very impressive and is very close to the highway, much more impressive than Sunwapta.\"Well worth the turn off the highway. Amount of water and the noise is amazing. Short walk from car park so no problem seeing this great sight.It is a very impressive area and not far off the highway so be sure to take the time to visit. How did the fish get above those falls???The sheer power and volume of these falls is not to be missed. A good location to see a beautiful without the long walks required of other locations in this area.\"What surprised me was that the water was very brown. The walking path was nice enough, but I didn't find it too exciting.\"\"They may not match up to Niagra, but the Athabasca Falls certainly show just what water can do! These thunderings falls are carving a real chasm through the rocks and although they are not going to occupy you for hours it is a great free show with interesting information scattered around the many viewing areas. Definitely worth a visit if you are in jasper and especially if, like it was when we were there, the weather wasn't good enough to be heading up the mountains!\"If you don't like waterfalls than it probably is not for you but the walk is what I would class as an easy hike take a camera and a bottle of water and your set a great free attraction to do\"A must see for anyone visiting the Jasper area of the Rockies. The falls are magnificent, especially with the mountains in the background and there are several very good viewing areas from which to take photos.When we were returning to our coach, we spotted a black bear grazing in the wooded area adjacent to one of the pathways. It was calmly minding its own business so we did the same but got back to the coach faster than I think we would have done if we hadn't noticed the bear.\"\"Athabasca Falls enjoys a super tourist friendly approach (i.e. fast and paved) just off of the Icefields Parkway. Its a worthwhile stop, but expect loads of tourists and noise. The falls themselves are nice, although nothing too amazing if you've seen waterfalls and river canyons before.\"\"Athabasca Falls is a waterfall in Jasper National Park, situated next to the road. It is not known for its height, but for its force due to the large quantity of water falling into the gorge. It can be safely viewed and photographed from various viewing platforms and walking trails around the falls. I managed to capture the brillance of rainbow hued sprays at one part of the falls. From the start of the Upper Athabasca river, the water is calm. At the start of the falls, is also calm. Then the water gains momentum, and one can see the sheer force of the waters, rushing vigorously , powerfully down into the gorge. Then after the great fall, one sees calmness again\"\"Plenty of good viewing places and relevant information boards. Visiting in May we got to see ice and a good flow of water. The pathways are pretty good, watch your footing where tree roots have caused them to become uneven.\"\"these falls are right by the road, so anyone passing by has no excuse for not stopping. Really good views of the falls from many viewing areas, and plenty of great photo opportunities.I've knocked a star off because the toilets were absolutely disgusting. The smell almost made me sick.All in all, a must-see waterfall but avoid the conveniences.\"\"Visited this area in April. The waterfall and ice formations were beautiful and fascinating. It wasn't completely frozen, so some water was flowing down the waterfall. Beautiful views of the blue-green water on the other side of a bridge.\"Beautiful waterfall with good access longer walks possible easy to find with good parking great place to view wildlife.Lovely waterfall on the glacial river. Liked the Good info as you walked down to it. Nothing to dislike\"I was blown away by the Partnachklamm near Garnisch, The Athabasca Gorge is the nearest thing on this continent to reflect the shear power of water.\"\"While we were in Jasper we did a drive out to the falls. They are just a short walk from the parking lot and certainly worth seeing. You can hear the power of the water as you get closer. There are lots of information boards around and whilst at the main falls there are a few different viewing areas so make your way around. There is another trail which heads down the canyon for more views. I was reluctant to try it as there were warning signs about the number of steps involved on the return trip.Ended up doing it. Going down was fine and there were a LOT of steps but the lower canyon was also a great spot and the climb back, whilst tiring was manageable. You can take your time and have a rest along the way if need be.\"\"Good parking facilities and a very easy and nice walk to a majestic view. Walk around as much as you feel like and spend as much time as you can afford. We stop by each time we drive to Jasper and are equally impressed each time, as the falls and the surrounding area are in continuous change.\"\"The Falls are very easily accessible from the parking lot. They are well worth the short walk. Just over the top beautiful and amazing. Exceptional photos opportunities. Canada is packed full of majesty and beauty, Athabasca Falls is among the many fantastic sites to see. If you have mobility problems, do not skip this place very easy to maneuver.\"We took the shorter walk around the falls but it is beautiful and worth it. With time the longer walk would be nice too.\"The water has eroded the softer layers of rock here leaving harder layers behind, eventually cutting right down, making a narrow cut through which the water thunders down. The footpaths offer superb view-points from which to admire, photograph or simply stand and enjoy the wonder of this place. There are, like most attractions in Canada, comprehensive informative information boards to educate visitors.Do locate and visit the falls known as Natural Bridge in Yoho National Park. It is very different, stunning, not suitable for disabled or the faint hearted, if you have a little courage you can hop, skip and jump across this natural phenomena and take some brilliant photos or even videos. It will not disappoint those who love nature.\"\"The Falls are just a short walk from the parking lot. Another trail heads down the canyon for more views, but warns the visitor that there are a lot of stairs one will need to walk up on the return. But, the hike down the Lower Canyon is not necessary to enjoy the power and magnificence of these Falls. The main Falls are an easy hike and appear handicap accessible. A definite stop/hike to make.\"\"You start at the top of this extremely powerful and breathtaking waterfall and venture your way down to where the waterfall calmly streams into a wide river surrounded by mountains. You'll get some beautiful pictures, just don't drop your phone.\"An easy five-minute walk from the parking lot and you're there. Very impressive falls with lots of information on the boards about how the falls were formed. Not to be missed.\"A short pleasant walk from the car park to see these falls.Not high but a river squeezed into a canyon, the access is good but hang on to your kids!The power of the water going through the rocks is awesome!\"Easy access from the parking area. Very little walking required. Lots of viewing areas and photo ops. Definitely worth the stop.\"There is waterfall, and river to admire. The Park rangers also showed off a bear hides. Not much facilities though.\"This is quite close to the road and very much worth the stop. It's neither a long nor strenuous hike to see a lovely waterfall cutting uniquely through the rock formations.We stopped in on the way to the Icefields and are so glad we did not miss this. Great pathways. Get there early.You shouldn't go to Jasper or Lake Louise without stopping along the way to see this gorgeous waterfall and short walk to many vantage points. Very beautiful.\"Another of natures many wonders in this part of the world. I would suggest that if you're travelling to Banff, you see the falls on your way there. Only a short walk from the car park and you at the powerfull falls. There isn't a huge amount to do here, however I could stare at waterfalls all day so for me, loved it! It's also free!\"You have to be impressed with the power of water. Gallons and gallons roaring over the falls carving stone with consistent force and beauty. I have never been to Niagara Falls but I imagine that this is a slice of what it is like. We were on a tour and couldn't stay as long as we wanted. If I was fortunate enough to come back I would stay much longer and enjoy the trails and follow the roar of the water further. If you can go do so.Very good place for family outing. Fall views are well protected to have good view of the fall. Do follow the safety rules as water is fast and furious.Great scenery and water falls well worth a visit if you have time however the cafe prior to this is not worth the stop for coffee.\"Because it was snowing, this was a winter wonderland! Quite intriguing how the water rushes through. Good signage explaining what is happening!\"\"Although I was originally a little shocked that they'd compare these falls to Niagara, or even the splendor of The Great Wall of China and the Pyramids of Egypt (they actually do on the signs!), the Athabasca Falls were still a treat.Beyond the main falls, there is a number of short walks available which are also worth taking and it was disappointing (but great for us) that not many of the tourists bothered to make the detour. Situated between Jasper and the Columbian Icefields, I definitely recommend making a stop here at Athabasca Falls.\"\"We were advised by our hosts in Jasper to be sure to do this falls and they were right. Awesome falls in the spring of the year as the snow is melting. Who doesn't love a roaring falls?? Be sure to put this on your \"\"To Do\"\" list.\"\"We only were able to spend a short time at these falls which were stunning. It was not very busy so we had good views. We walked from the car park, short distance, and easy paths, but can be a bit skippy in places on the concrete. Plenty of places to take some good pictures.\"Beautiful! Took about 45 minutes to walk around the various paths. Many photo ops. Loved it! Beware: many steps.\"The walk here is another beautiful sight to see. Along the road, we saw a lot of wildlife. We only stayed a short while as the trail was quite busy.\"Fantastic what nature can do. This was a lovely day out for us. Thoroughly enjoyed the amazing falls.\"Unexpectedly beautiful. From the parking lot, my husband said 'there are no waterfalls here'...only to turn a corner and see absolute beauty!\"There is a walkway around the falls that lets you get right up close to them. We were lucky enough to be there when it wasn't busy but I can imagine that it can get quite full in season. Really impressive!\"The falls are quite stunning and the rock formations which they created over millions of years are now very accessible via an improved hiking trail and new bridges. Naturally carved \"\"stairways\"\" are a beautiful sight. There are new rest room facilities as well. You cannot get the full experience and views from the highway or your car.\"\"We were only there for a short time during a trip,but it is well worth a stop. The area is lovely and the falls are powerful and you can get some great snaps\"Nice short hike. Beautiful. We actually photographer here at night since it's a short little walk on a paved path from the parking lot.Easy to walk around. Amazing views. Its free. Easy to find. Ample parking. Worth a visit. Preferred it to Sunwapta Falls - more to see and read.The waterfalls is OK. We spent about one hour to walk around and take pictures. It is easy to access the falls.While on our Canadian Rockies tour we were taken to Athabasca Falls by our tour guide. He said there are other waterfalls in the area but this was the nicest. We were not dissapointed. The falls are a short paved walk from the parking area easily accessable to those with handicaps. And the view of the falls is well worth the short stop. There are walking trails to the side of the falls to get a different view which I would not recommend for those with handicaps. There is also a stepped walkway to the bottom of the falls. Take a few minutes and enjoy this natural beauty.\"Stopped on our way to Banff. We'll worth the time and the walk, although as short as you want. We never went the whole way as bridge 5 was closed, still early season and the bears were just starting to appear. In a way some of the features were like Maligne Canyon but very different in other ways. Another must see in Canada.\"\"Well worth a 30 minute stop on your way down the Icefields Parkway. Close to the carpark, and an impressive amount of water coming over.\"The falls were full and powerful. This is our third visit and we are still in awe of these falls.There is an interesting trail that follows one of the river used to flow and you can walk right up to the end where the river opens up.It was really good to go there in June as the melted snow makes for a very full waterfall.Easy access to a wonderful series of falls. We were there in the height of the melt water coming down from the surrounding area so not sure how impressive they would be later in the year. Maybe something to bear in mindThis is the most convenient of the canyons/falls in Jasper and Banff and it is very impressive. A very short walk (couple 100 yrds if that) and then you can go further if you want. All paved. Because of its convenience expect crowds and tour buses. Crowds aren't our thing but we're glad we stopped by for 15-20min.\"We saw woodlands orchids in bloom on the path to the falls. This is not an easy place for elders or handicapped individuals, but otherwise- just awesome. The view left little to be desired if you like waterfalls.\"Beautiful location - the mountains in the background are only beaten by the stunning falls themselves. A must see.We stopped off at the falls as we drove the Icefields Parkway and were very pleased that we did. The fals themselves were very easy to get to from the car park and were in ful flow - the sound was wonderful and the view even better.\"This is one of the more popular waterfalls along the parkway (as seen by the number of tour buses that stop here). Lots of paths make it easy to see the falls with several viewpoints, each with great views. This is probably the most impressive waterfall on the entire drive between Jasper and Banff, well worth stopping by while driving the Icefields Parkway.\"Amazing!!! Easy to access and visit on the way thought the Icefields Parkway and to walk around. Only takes a short topi me to see it all but worth the stopeasy access from car park. beautiful falls. The thaw had just started so lots of snow and lots and lots of water. Well worth a visit.There was a lot of water because the snow started melting. Impressive noise and sight on the water thats smashed down. Following the stairs you see the rockets with the different colours after ages pressure of the water.\"thundering sound of the water crashing over the rocks was great!fascinating how the water has sculpted the landscape\"This is a short easy walk near the Icefields Parkway. As you walk along the paved path you discover more and more sights of water.\"The Falls have an excellent system of walkways and vantage points to watch the water thundering through the gorge. Lots of different picture possibilities here.Also excellent parking and picnic areas nearby.There is no long hiking trail to get there (unlike many attractions in the park), so only a drive to the site and you're there.\"\"I always love going and seeing these awesome Falls! My favourite part is after you cross the bridge, turn right and you walk down stairs where the water used to run... I always find it fascinating!Almost every time we go, there is some one climbing over a fence. There are signs every where saying how slippery the rocks are. If you go visit these falls, be warned, people have died from climbing over the fences to take pictures. The Falls are beautiful and amazing even from behind the fences so please stay safe!\"\"The Falls are easy to reach. The view was breathtaking. There where 2 busloads of tourists so we waited 15 minutes till they where gone, then we had the Falls in a private session.\"\"Amazing waterfalls and canyon. Like many other popular attractions in the Canadian Rockies, this too is highly accessible from car-park with only a few minutes walking.The twist is that the water hasn't always flew in the same channel, it used to flow in another parallel channel, until the water managed to beat the rock and find an alternative, better route (the current channel). So what you can see today is both the wet canyon and the dry canyon - scar that remained from the past, when water used to flow in its previous path.\"An amazing visit with family. The view is amazing a must see. Walking is not too bad. The amount of water going through these falls is amazing.\"Stopped here driving from Lake Louise to Jasper to give the kids a break. For such a great view and scenic wonder this is very non-touristy. No gift shops, pay parking, guidebooks, etc but still a walkway with information boards and great access. The kids loved it. Down on the lake shore many visitors have stacked stones to mark their own visit. In many countries these would get knocked down and ruined but he they are left. Making a form of visitors book.\"\"Stopped off at the falls on the way to Jasper. Well worth a walk to the far side of the falls to get the best views of the falls and the gorge below.Good parking close to the falls.\"If you are in the area do not miss this it is very cool to see how the water has carved a trench through the rock over the years. Mother Nature at her finest!!Huge water fall with interesting short hike in the same area as you step through where the falls used to be. One of the better Falls in the Parks and is worth the stop.\"This waterfall was mostly frozen, when we visited it. It was still stunning to see. Unfortunately one of the walks was blocked off due to snow, however this didn't prevent seeing some great views of the falls\"\"Perfect setting for an engagement:) We drove from Ontario to British Columbia in September of 2000 and stopped at Athabasca Falls on the way. It is beautiful, plain and simple. Definitely recommend a stop here.\"A very pretty waterfall with a nice hike around it. Try to do the full circuit walk for views from different vantage points. We visited when it was raining lightly. The pathways were slippery but we had a very beautiful rainbow over it. One of the highlights of the trip.\"It is a very beautiful stop. You can see the falls easily from the parking lot. However if you're looking for a hike its a really easy, beautiful, and short hike. I'd guess less than 2-3 km total. Just make sure to stay behind the barriers. The rocks here are super slippery and dangerous if you ignore the barriers.\"\"The falls is just magnificent even if it's still frozen when we went there. You would just imagine how beautiful it could be during summer when the water is fast moving. If you plan to come during the spring, you should wear good hiking and/or winter shoes for traction as the stairs and some tracks are still icy and slippery.We'll try to come back during the summer to see the difference.\"Athabasca falls are one of the gems along the icefield parkway from Jasper to Banff. Very easy walk from the parking lot to the falls and viewpoints just on the edge of the falls. Beware of some water puddles and spraying. Our 7 years old really enjoyed and it was also an excellent photo op.\"We were here while there was still snow on the ground. While we had a decent time, and enjoyed the walk, I don't recommend going in the winter, especially if you have mobility issues, as the stairs are not cleared and are quite slippery. We ended up going down the stairs and then at the other side climbing up the hill to the road to have an easier walk back.\"\"Thunderous waterfall with easy access for the mobility challenged. Do NOT get close to the edge though! In addition to the \"\"rush\"\" from being close to this much water moving this fast, you may even see the resident black bear with cubs!\"\"Me and my two friends stopped at Athabasca Falls on our way from skiing at Marmot Basin. It was at the end of winter, so all the other attractions along the way to Lake Louis were closed. Athabasca Falls were the only accessible through the snow and it was definitely worth stopping by.They were all frozen and it was magical to see that even such a power can freeze down and make incredible sculptures. The trail around them was covered in snow and not all open, so we had to watch our step, so we didn't fall.\"\"If you travel by car from Jasper, there's an alternative and interesting drive to the main Icefields Highway - turn right about 10km south of Jasper onto route 93A and have a relaxed and interesting drive. the road ends at the Falls, where it rejoins the Icefields Highway. The falls, although not especially high, are spectacular and the National Park management have installed walkways and a bridge that allows everyone to safely get close to many facets of the cascades.\"A must see while travelling. A great excuse to stop and stretch your legs and see some pretty special falls and learn some history along the wayWe love Jasper area and make it a regular stop every year. Been coming to the falls ever since I was young. Now I bring my children. Can't wait until this yearThe trembling waters cutting through the mountain is amazing. Completely in awe at the sheer beauty!\"If you're in the Jasper area in the winter, take the short 20 minute drive (not including stopping for photos of a lot of wildlife!) to the Athabasca Falls. They truly are stunning when they're frozen.When we were there in February, the river and falls were almost completely frozen solid. There was still a bit of water running, but not much. We went in the early afternoon, around 2pm. There was still enough sun to hit the ice and make it shine.Be careful of your footing, and wear proper winter footwear. The paths are someone maintained, but they are covered in snow and some ice. Common sense and good shoes will keep you safe!\"\"I love Athabasca Falls! It doesn't matter how many times I see them, I am still awed by their sheer power and beauty. I've stopped here in winter as well and the silence and stillness of these massive falls is equally impressive in winter.\"\"Athabasca Falls is my absolute favorite place to go while in Jasper. I love nature and seeing how the land, trees, and overall landscape change over time. Athabasca Falls delivers on every level. The informative plaques describe how the falls came to be, where the water once flowed and how the course has changed, and offer information on the history. Although the summer is my favorite time to visit the roaring falls I most definitely enjoyed our recent trip to the falls. As the parking lot was not cleared we ended up parking on the side of the road and walking down. Having Athabasca Falls to ourselves without a sound around but the small hole of flowing water that broke under the frozen falls was absolutely surreal! We toured around, carefully, and took pictures of the sites without having to wait for other tourists which is uncommon. I love the falls in the summer but the winter visit did not disappoint!\"lots of areas to walk to to see the falls and the breath taking views of them roaring down was awesome!\"We were in Jasper on the weekend looking to for a hike or a walk suitable for small children. Our 4 kids are ages 5-13 and we all loved the scenic 20 minute drive out to the falls and the short, easy walk to see the frozen waterfalls. The kids played in the snow and there are outdoor toilets nearby for potty breaks! It was free fun and we loved it. Stayed about an hour out there.\"\"Right off the Ice filed Hwy heading toward Jasper, a few minutes moderate hike to the fall itself. Specular views and the sound of the water hitting of the rocks makes it that much visiting. You really get to feel the power of the water flow. Camera is a must, wonderful spots for pix. Numerous platforms to view the fall from different angles, not too busy with tourists and a must visit if travelling along the ice field parkway.\"These falls are beautiful! There are lots of pathways and stairs so some places are not very accessible if you have mobility issues. Lots of places to take pictures and different views. I enjoyed reading all the signs and we will definitely stop here again!\"I am only rating these falls as average as we only saw them from the road bridge which is a real shame (this is because we didn't want to be naughty and push our luck parking up on the road and wandering in which is what a lot of people seem to do)Even from the bridge you get a reasonable view of the falls and a really good impression of their magnificence, I have been in autumn and they were breath taking\"The sheer size of the falls and the excellent walkway with narrative boards made a very pleasant stopping place on the way to the Colombi Icefields\"These falls are pretty much right next to the Icefields Parkway. The lot where you park is a short walk to the main falls. The falls are truly spectacular (I keep using that adjective for attractions along the Parkway, and with good reason...it's true). The sound of the water cascading over the falls is very soothing, There are several areas you can walk to to view different areas of the falls, but the one you approach first is really great. Don't pass up this attraction while travelling the Icefields Parkway. It is very worthwhile and extremely accessible.\"\"It is just fabulous, incredible colours of the water, the lake, and the trail in the woods under huge rocks makes it a must stop in Jasper!\"\"Pretty short and very enjoyable hike. The falls are lovely and if it's in the summer, the water mist is very cooling and enjoyable. The trail is well shaded as well.\"\"This place is amazing in winter. The falls had frozen solid and displayed some amazing blues,greens & turquoise. The walk down to the falls was a bit dangerous and older people could easily fall. So good walking shoes are a must in the winter.\"This short hike (which took us awhile because of how many pictures we were all taking) is an awesome way to see the beautiful glacier fed Athabasca River. The rock formations around the river are unlike anywhere I had seen before. Got some awesome photos! The walk is not too strenuous and I believe the upper portion is even handicapped accessible.\"Athabasca Falls was something so beautiful, newer seen anything like this. We were there early morning, waiting for the first sunlight. No tourist rush, no screaming children... just calm and beautiful.\"A must visit for everyone. Stunning visually but the sound it makes is tremendous. A video camera is essential\"The canyon is a fascinating formation. It twists and turns, it narrows to a slot canyon than opens up into a wide waterfall. Make sure you give yourself the time to do the whole walk around the area.\"\"These are majestic falls and worth a visit off the highway.It may look serene as you anter, but take a look much further in and you will not be disappointed at all. Sadly the concrete walkways detract from the natural awe and charm evident here. However, they are there to protect you from the canyon below. Do check it out if your nearby. Worth it!!!\"\"Went with sun dog tours excellent trip ,stopped on way to Banff ,the power of water incredible plus the beautiful colours.\"We went in November & the ice added to the beauty of the falls. I would highly recommend going in late autumnThis is a must stop see just outside of the city of Jasper! It is very safe but yet you fell so close you could almost touch it!The view of the Falls is great and no one should miss it if they are in the vicinity. At the time of our visit the river was literally overflowing with ice-melted water and the view was overwhelming.\"Easy to get to, located right off of the icefields parkway. Can get crowded do to the convenient location but definitely a must see attraction in Jasper!\"\"We went to Athabasca falls on a Sunday so was more busy but was cool and sunny and spectacular. A definite place I would recommend, beautiful.\"\"If you are driving by, it is worth stopping for. But it is not special enough to drive any distance to see.\"\"Regardless of whatever time you view them throughout the year, the Athabasca Falls are guaranteed to be running solidly. Some excellent walkways and bridges have been added over the years which allow excellent viewing of the falls from most angles. Venture a bit further afield and you are able to view further down the river where the falls resume with the meandering river. Well worth the turnoff for the view\"We really enjoyed walking around here. There are a number of pathways and viewpoints allowing you to get a feel for the water and how the rocks have been reshaped.A sobering memorial explains how a young guy fell off the slippery (having climbed over the guard rail!) and that a couple of people die each year! Stay behind the rails...This is well worth the visit to see how the water has cut it's way through the rocks. Not very high (like Helmcken falls) but the shapes that have been carved out are amazing. You are able to walk through an area where the water used to flow but no longer does and the shapes are great to see. Good toilet facilities on site (the usual pit in the ground) and well worth a visit.You need stamina to make the trek all around the falls. There is so he areas where a wheelchair can access the falls but really you need good legs to climb stairs and rpt filed trails.We came to see the natural beauty of Canada and weren't disappointed. If your going to Banff then drop past on your way there.We had considered skipping this stop but are very glad that we didn't! the falls are spectacular and are another must see in Jasper National Park.\"Considering it is right on the side of the road, you should definitely stop by and have a look at this. It's a lovely waterfall, with a nice river, all of it a lovely azure. It was very easy walk, and very close to the Jasper town.\"\"This is worth stopping for. Opportunity to take some beautiful photos of the falls with the mountain in background. Easy walk suitable for all. Usual restroom facilities, plenty of parking.\"not the highest falls in Jasper but definitely one of the most beautiful... Why? Because you see the battle between water & rock. Different paths are formed & you see what what water can do with rocks. Also the trail tells you how this happens. the Trail is max 45 min and is worth every minute of your time. Easy accessibleBring your camera. What an interesting geological site. The walk to the falls was easy and there were interpretive signs along the way.Must do stop....it is stunning. Take hike over to lake it is lovely as well. There are quite a few different things to see there.give yourself lots of time.\"These easily accessible falls are worth the Icefield parkway stop. The colors are amazing, as well as the cliffside \"\"gardens\"\". The falls start is turbulent which you can follow as they cascade into a aquamarine pool which will take the waters to the Arctic waters.\"\"What's interesting about the rockies is that there are so many little detours you can take to see something beautiful and this is one of the ones we came across on a spontaneous road trip. The falls are gorgeous, and there's a pretty well constructed path for you to follow to experience it. Besides the $20 fee to enter Jasper National Park there's no cost to visit the individual sights in the area. This waterfall is gorgeous. though quite busy in the summer.\"When I got there I was a little dissapointed. Thought the attraction was just a few small falls we see right when we get there. But there is so much more. The water's color is unreal and all the rocky mountains around it make it a beautiful picture. The power of nature is stunning. Good place to stop and watch and think.These falls can be looked at from different angles. Each viewpoint opens a new vista to the onlooker. The walk in is a gentle walk. Enjoy\"Truly spectacular falls - the day we were there was freezing cold but well worth the trip.The cuts taken out of the rocks below the falls are also spectacular\"\"Was there twice this year. Once in July, where the falls wer in full force, and once in October 2013, where they were much more passive. Always a great sight to go see. One warning though, stay behind the fence. There is always someone climbing over the fence for a better picture and there has been deaths due to this. Please respect the falls.\"\"This is a great place to stop and enjoy the power of nature first hand. Only steps from the highway, Athabaska Falls will let you see why and how water can carve channels in the rock. Take the short hike to the area below the falls and you'll be amazed how fast the raging torrents turn into a peaceful little bay.\"This is a lovely place to visit..very pretty..but there is only so long you can ooh and aah for !!! Have seen other falls as well\"The Athabasca Falls is a must see if you are in Jasper! It is really only accessible to see in the late spring, summer and early fall months of the year. It is closed in the winter for your safety as the road offers poor driving conditions in the winter months. This is wonderful spot for photographers - with the majestic mountain background, the flowing Athabasca River that leads to the falls, the sweeping deep canyons formed over the years and the hard rushing falling water makes your images ones you will treasure forever. You can drive here yourself or you can take a bus tour to get here. It is better if you can drive yourself as then you can take your time at the falls. Also, driving on your own you can then drive to the nearby \"\"Meeting Of The Waters\"\" which is where the Whirlpool River meets the Athabasca River. As the waters meet rushing side by side - one side is crystal clear and clean while the other side is muddy. There are many little places to stop and see along the way if you drive on your own to the Athabasca Falls - and if you have the time and continue along highway 93 or even highway 93A you can visit Lake Louise for the day. So much beauty to take in to the Athabasca Falls and from the Athabasca Falls. Enjoy!\"This is well worthwhile. The scenery and the roar of the falls one of Jasper parks nice (and noisy) attractions.\"This is another example of nature creating an exceptional and transforming way for water to travel. The formations and crevices, magnified by the unusual color of the water, create magnificent art to enjoy right by the parking lot. Take time to enjoy and walk down by the canyon as well.\"Driving from Jasper to Banff this was one of our first stops and defiantly one of the high lights! With many viewing points the waterfall drops away violently into the canyon and exits a calm pale stream. Truly breath taking.\"We visited these falls trowards the end of a cold, snowy day and this added to the drama. That said, the water colour was a stunning sapphire blue. The Falls are easily accessible from the car park which is itself, just off of the Icefields Parkway. I wish I could remember the name of the mountain on the opposite side of the Parkway but the imposing presence of this added to the atmosphere.\"Beautiful falls right off the Iceburg Parkway and easy to walk to. Worth stopping to see and enjoy the sights!!Must be able to manage a few steps. Salutary lesson about previous casualties at the falls. Liked the peace and quiet of the lower canyonThe falls are fearsome and demonstrate the power of nature. Be sure to walk down the trail of the old path of the falls to see how the water originally flowed and look back up across to the bridge to see how high up you are from the falls.There is quite the view of this waterfall. Amazing how much water can shape the land and rocks around it. Take a walk down the path to see all the sites\"I loved the sound it made, in early summer it must be absolutely deafening. There were also lots of squirrels around\"\"This is easily accessible and has several bridges that allow different vantages of the falls. It has ample parking and can be busy when tour buses pull into the parking lot. There are several view points along the route, though, and some great photo ops.\"\"Lots of people know about this place, just off the Hwy, lots of parking available, a smaller falls but lots of power and great trails to see it all. Take pictures!\"\"This one gorgeous falls. It was in the Fall when I arrived, I would love to see it in the Spring when runoff occurs.\"\"Got beautiful photos here, even with the mountains hidden in clouds, the falls are still pretty. Somewhat crowded with buses and large tour groups though.\"Take tour time when visiting Athabasca Falls. There are so many nooks and diversions with numerous viewpoints that it is hard not to miss at least some of them. The falls are gorgeous (excuse the pun)! We started off in cloudy weather and had to redo all the photography stuff when eventually the sun broke through.\"stunning beauty all around!! right off the parkway. great views of the river and mountains.part of the trail from the parking lot to the falls is paved.\"This was just part of a spectacular day travelling between banff and Jasper. We'll worth seeing and a memory which will live with me forever\"During our trip thru the mountains, we stopped to visit the Athabasca Falls. We are certainly glad we did. It was fall and the air was crisp and smelled amazing. Loved the hike to get to see the falls and could have stayed and gazed at them for hours. It was great being there off season as there were not hordes of people to contend with. Tons of great photo opportunities!! I encourage anyone travelling in the area to stop at the Athabasca Falls. Loved it!!!\"\"A two hour visit, with the river forcing itself through a devils cauldron and carving a canyon through to the other side. Well laid out for tourists to visit all aspects.\"\"Water floe is don this year, End of Sept. Have stopped there several time, good stop. The falls are always interesting, even with lower water flow.\"\"We spent almost an hour here walking around, taking pictures, and looking at all the beauty of the fall. Definitely worth the stop. No strenuous hiking required.\"\"We took the trail along the canyon. At the bridge, it was hard to see the water because the canyon is so narrow, and the river is a long way down. The falls are beautiful, and well worth the short hike.\"was on the list and could see this was rated on TA. It was on the way from/to Jasper but we made the trip on the way from jasper to calgary. This place is easy to locate and just 200 meters from the highway and the falls is just right next to the parking lot. came here and was amazed - took the usual photos and off on our way along the IP. we probably took 30 mins max staying at this place (sadly during our week it was getting chilly [end of sept] so you just want to take photos and get out of there lol so I would say during summer time would be nice to hang around and have lunch here or a snack)Athabasca Falls is located in the Jasper National Park. The falls were formed by the water over many thousands of years. The trail along the river is well worth the visit. One portion of the trail goes through a slot that was abandoned by the water many years ago. The rock formations along the wall are very interesting. The trail is not suited for strollers or wheelchairs. Also water your young children as the water is running fast and one of the benches along the trail is dedicated to a young man that slipped and fell into the water. The tour buses stop here so go early to avoid the crowds.This is an easy walk to view the falls and they are worth the walk. You can actually climb down the trail through parts of the canyon to the river and perhaps get lucky and see white water rafters. This canyon engages you to imagine the water rushing through here thousands of years ago and it shows what strength water has. Don't be afraid to get wet at the actual falls as water sprays high into the air. A must see on the Jasper Parkway.\"Check it out! Even my 2 year old thought that the falls were fantastic!! You really do not have to walk too far, to be able to see the falls!\"The falls were quite fierce...we took this on put way from Lake Louise to Jasper.... kids were quite excited.Lots of good view points to see different angles of the falls. Well worth exploring them all. This is not far from jasper.These falls were one of the highlights of our trip to Canada. They are beautiful to behold and there are lots of information plaques to read about how they were formed. The water is so blue.Beautiful and great for photos. Short walk around worth the great views. You can even build your own inukshuk down at the lower lake. Stunning and a sight you won't forget\"Loud in places, bit of a spray. Nice views. plenty of visitors.Plenty of viewing platforms all around.\"\"If you haven't seen Athabasca falls you're missing out on a great attraction. I've seen them about 5 times in my life, the first time when I was a child of 7yrs old. It's a must see,you'll enjoy it.\"\"If you are travelling along the Icefield Parkway, it is worth taking a short stop en route to visit the Athabasca Falls, which in late September are not too busy.\"\"Worth a look although it is busy, lots of tourists, coaches etc. we did the walk around and down the the lower falls as it is good to stretch your legs.\"\"It's worth the hike to see the falls. There are many beauty spots in The Rockies, but this is one of those that's worth a detour!\"The falls have carved out a very interesting route though the rocks. We found them full and rushing. The drop off toward the river was narrow and steep. It's amazing what water over time can create. Worth a stop.\"A neat stop, well suited to tourists and geologists alike. Lots of designated viewing areas, well thought out.\"\"This one has to be seen. Cascading massive falls coming from the Athabasca Glacier. A walkway around makes viewing safe for all, although it can be crowded at busy times.\"\"Amazing falls / canyon - a must see if passing through this area.Parking is close to the falls so not a long walk - there are also pathways all around the area so it's easy to walk round and take in the spectacular views.\"\"One of the falls on Ice Parkway. Nice roaring water fall in summer.Should visit if you are on Ice parkway.\"\"Wonderful sight and must be done as part of any visit to Western Canada.Highly recommended.We were very impressed at the natural washrooms in every sightseeing spot in the National Parks.\"The Athabasca Falls are magnificent and one of the many spots we always take our Alberta visitors to. For the most part the walking is easy but there is a lower view which can be challenging to anyone not steady on their feet.If you are visiting Jasper don't miss this wonder of nature.How can water falling give you such a good feeling? This is a stunning area near Jasper. Wonderful place.\"If we were to advise someone going to Jasper for the first time, we'd tell you not to miss this. It's close to the freeway, doesn't require any hiking to see it, and it is absolutely spectacular.\"one of the many stops you can take while driving along the icefield parkway. a nice trail leads to the fallls. the falls is great for photographs.\"It is not signed very well from the parking lot, but follow the sound of the water. You view the falls from a number of angles. The paths are paved and the walk is not too strenuous, even the walk back up. You can follow the canyon down to a beach area where people have built several inikshuks.\"This place is a must when in the area. Lots of viewing areas. Beautiful area to walk around. I have never seen anything so amazing. Not to be missed.Absolutely worth viewing. It would have stood out more as an amazing sight if we had not have tried to cram so much into one day of taking in such incredible geological wonders. Wish we had more time to spread it out. Try to do so.\"These are beautiful falls. Just off the road and crowded, but well worth a stop. There are many places around the falls to get many varied views.\"A must visit just to see the power of the water. Lovely on a hot day with the must spraying on your face. A nice walk to the bottom to the 'pebble beach' where you can build your own Inuksuk!\"Not well signed off the Parkway, so keep a lookout. We nearly missed it and we were keeping an eye out for the turnoff when driving southbound.It's approximately 35 km south of Jasper. Lots of parking. Superb views of the falls and river from the walkways. We got there about 09.30 and the car park was empty. We had the place to ourselves. Great views of the Athabasca river. The water over the first set of falls was in full flow and we could hear the roar from the car park. The river has cut lots of interesting shapes into the rock, some of which it has now abandoned and which you can walk through. Fabulous - and free..\"\"Be sure to visit here, the hike to the Glaciers (two) is moderate, maybe a little steep, but I am 78 and made it so you can. It is worthwhile\"Good attraction but long walk if you are not a bus or invalid. Walk if steep and hard for the unfit so if you are aged or unfit go up to the next car park and the walk from here is just a short walk.A must-see stop along the Icefields Parkway. The wide river funnels into a very narrow rock canyon that has some unusual forms and shapes. Good walk-ways and overlooks are provided.The loud roar and clouds of mist coming from the falls emphasizes how much power is being corralled by the rocks around these falls. Don't miss this attraction.\"This waterfall is one of the best places for a close up of falls. With the Rocky Mountains topping it, the scene is one of a kind. Between the trees the mountains and the falls appear as if they are a natural camera view. This is the second time for me to see it and never stopped being impressed.\"\"Athabasca Falls gives more bank for the buck than most other waterfall sites. It is easily accessible from the well-maintained parking lot. It is best viewed in the Fall, when there are far fewer tourists. Even so, the path is well marked with interpretive signs and the falls are amazing as they plunge over rocks and course through a steep canyon.\"\"Brilliant, best waterfall between Jasper and Banff, definitely worth a stop whilst on the Icefields parkway\"\"Beautiful, powerful - lots of energy!! We were very close to the falls - closer than you can get at Niagara. You really get the sense of the power because of the closeness. Worth seeing!!!\"Typical Canadian scenery well organised and well worth the visit. Its not Niagara but still an amazing sight.These falls were running very fast when we visited and the flow was impressive. The track was well maintained and lookouts situated in some good places. Truly another marvel of Mother Nature.\"Have stopped here over 100 times, and never get tired of it. Looks amazing in every weather, any season. Make sure to follow the path down to the river! (turn right after you crossed the bridge)\"First week of September still great flow of water. Can't imagine how it must look in spring and early summer! Pathways and overlooks well maintained.\"its not as big as niagra falls (not even close), but you do get to see the falls up close without having to get on a boat and sail towards it. its is a convenient accessible site.\"\"Me and my fiance stopped by, as we were staying at Whistler's campground in Jasper. Its about a 30 minute scenic drive from their. She thought that the falls were a little boring but I thought they were beautiful. We only spent five-ten minutes at the falls and were able to see from all the vantage points. Make sure you were an extra layer if you want to stay for a while because it cools down around the falls.\"Definitely worth the stop and the very short walk to the view. It is very popular so you don't feel like you're off the beaten track but you should not miss is.cool mountain water rushing over rocks and cliffs....thrilling! careful that you wear good shoes as it can get slippery with the spray of water. there is hand rails so you can get great photos!\"Okay place to see some fall, but not something I would put at the top of our list. Better to hike somewhere and see some of the remote falls\"\"One of the most beautiful falls I have ever seen. Easy access to the site off of the main highway into Jasper. Don't miss this if you are in the area. Parts of the area are handicapped accessible, but most are not. Plan on spending at least 30 minutes here as some of the most spectacular sites are when you cross over the bridge to the other side of the falls. The fast flow of water is amazing.\"\"look at the rock formation and the canyon, to see the force of nature and power of water. This is easily accessible, large body of water fall, good paths to walk along, and even somewhat hidden picnic tables just upstream that we totally missed and settled for the picnic area next to parking lot.Next time, I'll walk 100 ft upstream and spend an hour eating my sandwich lunch box there.Certainly not Niagara, but this is the best one in Banff-Jasper corridor.\"The Athabasca Falls were beautiful. We spent some time hiking and then just sitting and enjoying the sound of the rushing water. We took some great pictures. There were alot of people but the sound of the water keeps the area quiet and you really don't hear people talking.\"Very scenic and a camera is a must, however, there are chipmunks that throw pine cones at you (seriously) :-)\"\"Well worth a visit. The falls are very deceptive initially but up close are quite spectacular. The cost is .... well free! Go early and there are very few people but the sun is shining into your lens. Later in the day may be better for photos. Either way, they are well worth a visit.\"\"Not quite Niagara, but these are impressive falls nonetheless, and they provide some excellent photo opportunities.\"\"You really see the power of water here. The falls drops to a gorge and swirls around in a dance of beauty. Once again it,s great to see that Alberta is not greedy and the charge is $0.00. The surounding mountains make this a perfect spot to see the power of God,s creation\"Worth getting up early so you can get there before the crowds. Take a little time to go to all the viewpoints and then walk down to the bottom. The walk down is stairs cut into the old path of the falls so pretty cool to see up close the channels cut.\"If you're on the Icefields Parkway, you'd be foolish to skip this. Falls are beautiful; accessible. Rainbow when the sun is shining through the mist. The walk down to the bottom is easy and it's fun to walk through the \"\"old\"\" canyon.\"\"Maybe we are spoiled having seen Niagara, or some of the fantastic falls in Iceland such as Gullfoss but we were all complete underwhelmed by these falls. Are they nice ? Yes. Does the whirlpool current at the base create interesting circular erosion patterns ? yes. Does all the walk ways stink of stale urine ? yes, which is disgusting as Jasper National Park is full of bathrooms. Anyway, if you are driving by these falls why wouldn't you go look at them. But in our humble opinion, and we maybe have been spoiled by other falls in the world, these falls are small and Jasper has much more to offer.\"\"This is a powerful waterfall, not like most of what you see coming down the high mountains. You see it as it drops over a huge gorge it has created. & is really unusual. You have to walk a little but it was worth it.\"Not everyone who visits the Rockies is a considerate traveller. The ease of getting to Athabasca Falls is offset by the shear number of tourists which can make the experience less enjoyable. Try not to visit on a long weekend or get there before 10 am. Be sure to cross the pedestrian bridge as views from the far side are compelling. Thankfully there are picnic tables in the parking lot (though not many of them) so it's a nice place to stop for lunch.\"Nice walking trails to view the falls from many vantage points. A nice, quick and easy stop to incorporate in your day.\"\"I loved it and this was about my 3rd visit there. Great location for people with mobility issues, the paths are all paved but there are some stairs if you want to go further on the path.\"\"Although it is not a very high waterfall, its force is amazing. The walk is easy, even for small children, and very scenic.\"\"Don't miss out on seeing this attraction. Truly beautiful. It can get very busy here, so I'd suggest visiting the falls in the early morning.\"\"We were exhausted from hiking but were still able to walk down and see the falls. Paved walkways, close views, nice bridges, and really designed for tourists.\"\"It's only a short drive off the Icefields Parkway so why not check it out? For us it was a one-time deal. There were large, annoying crowds of people watching water tumble over some rocks into a deep channel. It was OK for a waterfall.\"Worth the 30 - 45 mins it takes to see the attraction. Stay on the pathways and you'll get some great photos.Easy to get to and very accessible to all. These are very nice falls and well presented with the layout of the paved trail. Nice although it was very busy which I suspect is usually the case.\"Go early in the morning to avoid the crush of people, but the amazing nature at her best is on display. Close by some great trails for hiking too.\"Loved this place - our first stop-off on the drive from Jasper to Banff. Not very well signposted but really worth an hour's visit to explore the wonders of these amazing waterfalls and gorge.\"These falls are striking, just off the Icefields Parkway and a stop here provides a nice break on your drive between Lake Louise and Jasper.\"These were smaller but seemed just as powerful as Niagara Falls and you get to go right up to it! Great experience. Made the entire Jasper detour from Banff worth it alone.\"We enjoyed visiting Athabasca Falls and walking the different trails. This is one place the tourist buses come so it was a bit crowded but was still worth the visit. After walking the standard route to the falls, we took the stairs through the gorge down to the river and then walked about ten minutes along the river bank. There are other trails that go along the river before the falls that we walked. The best thing to do if you have an hour or two is to get away from the main falls and take the trails to see the sights and the river.\"\"This was a great spot. The falls and the resulting canyons were very cool. Stay away from the edge, we saw a bench dedicated to a young man who lost his life falling in the falls - interesting but sad.Definitely worth a stop if your on the Icefield's highway.\"Beautiful falls with easy access for all ages. Walking a bit further than the first bridge is worth the small hike down and back.This place is a must-see if you are anywhere in the area of Jasper. It is amazing! You will not regret spending time here.I don't know how many times I am going to say this about attractions around Japer but another must see absolutely beautifulbeautiful! will take your breath away.I liked everything about this! Would definately go see this attractionagain.\"Alright... there are water falls all over, but not many like one. It seemed like just another place we ought to stop, but it was well worth an hour, The rock formations and the raging water are breath taking. This is worth a whole camera chip. It is difficult to know when to stop taking photos.\"\"The Falls are well worth the stop, seeing a wide river narrowed into a 10' wide cut in the rock. You will be able too see the falls from 3-4 different angle and they are breath taking. A path trails along the channel below the falls about a 1/4 mile to where the river widen again to continue it trip to the Arctic ocean. Don't miss the fantastic experience right off the Ice Fields Parkway.\"\"If you like waterfalls, rainbows, river and mountain scenery and interesting rocks this is the place for you.\"The power and beauty is second to none. Fabulous photo ops and well planned walking areas. You could spend hours wandering and never getting bored of the beauty around you.\"Come early in Summer and on a weekday if you can. If you leave Jasper around 9am, you will get there before any crowds and have the place almost to yourself.\"This was well served by a large car and coach park and there are viewing areas in several places around the top of the falls and as you walk down through the old channels to the river below. The power of the water and the never-ending flow are just wonderful to watch!\"Make sure you stop off to see this attraction ,a 5 minute walk from the car park and the noise and sight of rushing water through the rock canyon is spectacular, another short walk to the foot of the falls leads you to a large opening to the river with far reaching views.\"\"The falls are more complex than I expected. There were many different vantage points for viewing from different angles. A bit of exercise rewards one with even more sights, well worth it!\"Very pretty rainbow over the falls. Have seen bigger and better but this was very nice. It only took a few minutesb ut was well worth the trip.always a great stop. well worth seeing. impressive and beautiful. the falls are amazing and the walking paths and viewing platforms and veru well done.This is a great experience and an easy to get to place with superb walkways etc. The parking and 'long drop' toilets are good. Providing you stay on the walkways the whole experience is safe and gives one a memorable trip out. whilst you are in the area ride up to Mount Edith Cavell and see the beautiful Angel Glacier.\"During our stay in Jasper one of the great spots we visited was the Athabasca Falls. They are quite interesting and lovely to look at. The Athabasca River pours into a narrow canyon that it has carved out over hundreds of years and one can feel the power of the water as it gushes through. Just to the side of it there is another canyon where the river many years ago used to go through. A long time ago it must have found a weaker spot and started carving through there so now the old canyon sits dry. Makes one wonder if somewhere under that torrent of water another weaker spot in the rock is being slowly worn away to eventually form another new canyon of the future.Great falls to visit with not far to walk from the carpark. We had a picnic lunch there, beautifull spot, one to visit for sure\"This is an excellent place to take kids or your elders to see falls. The walk is a very short jaunt from the parking lot and the views are spectacular! Definitely a must see if your are in the Jasper area!\"I love waterfalls and this didn't fail to please....worth a visit. Great scenery, deep gorges and plunging water.\"\"There are a number of water falls in Jasper and Banff National Parks. However, this is one of the most breath taking. Do not miss it!\"\"Peaceful, relaxing and beautiful. We took a bunch of photos andthey turned our awesome. Would visit again.\"A very special place due to the physics with the river and the canyon it's created. Not many you can drive to in Alberta like this one.\"Well worth a stop, make sure you wander round it in all directions, the power and beauty of this is awesome\"Been here several times and always stop to take another look. The falls and surrounding area are beautiful and the way in which the water sculpts the surrounding rock is fascinating including in one area where you can walk down into a chasm that was carved by water than no longer flows through that area. There are several walkways and viewpoints that enhance the experience so well done on that front with the only negative being the same as always in the mountain parks - crowds in the summer - unavoidable and can't blame anyone - so enjoy the falls.\"The fall itself and the presentation of it, meaning the explanations and all, was really good. I would recommend all to stop by a take the easy trail to see the falls. Especially when we went, a lot of water so it made the falls a sight to see.You have got to see it!\"Such a lovely place. The river sweeps round and then tumbles down a gorge it has cut in the rock. The observation places are very good. Car parking is easy and it is close to the highway.In the vicinity of Jasper Tramway (approx. 20km away) and a such beautiful natural wonder. Perfect for all ages.To see a substantial river flow over a fall and squeeze through a narrow gorge is an awe inspiring sight. The viewing areas are safe with good sight-lines to the rapids above and the gorge below as well as the falls themselves. Although the parking lot was pretty full there is room enough for people to spread out and take time to enjoy this spectacle of nature.You need a parks pass but there is no separate fee for the falls\"The area is so well kept ... read all the signs, the history and development of the falls. Its amazing!\"Not much to say go see it! There are all kinds of beautiful in nature and this is a gem in the Jasper area.Short drive from Jasper are the incredible Athabasca falls. Awesome display of nature and the power it holds. Well worth the visit!\"We drove to Athabasca Falls one morning from Jasper via 93A. The scenery on the way is great, and the falls are impressive. It's a good idea to get there early before the crowds. There are outdoor privies in the parking lot--they don't smell great but are no worse than those at other scenic stops.\"Just the best waterfall and so easy to access from the road... Took fantastic photos and enjoyed uninterrupted views of the water pounding through the narrow rocky pass from the bridge and the easy walkway.Raw power of nature in the wild. It's incredible to think that these falls have been there for hundreds of years.Some of the most exciting things you will see in Jasper National Park are the falls carving out deep gorges. This drop in the Athabasca River is a well maintained interpretive trail with many overlooks on the river falls and into the deep gorge it carves. It is a great stop. And short hike.Worth stopping by but bathrooms smelled horribly. Bring your camera and don't be scared to go down step to lower level.\"Worth stopping to see, it is just off the highway. Great for picture taking or just to relax and watch the falls.\"The falls were quite convenient to the Icefields Parkway and we had the pleasure of seeing a small black bear browsing in the bushes along the access road. There is adequate parking and the trails are well-designed for the average photographer.Lots of people around but that doesn't stop one being able to enjoy the spectacular falls and pleasant walksWe visited the falls on a Saturday and it was busy....but the grounds are large enough to spread out the guests so it has a less crowded feel. Parks Canada has down an excellent job of constructing walkways and decks to maximize the access to and views of the falls without obstrcuting the natural apppearance of the falls. They are quite something...they remind me a little of the Rhine Falls in Schauffhausen Switzerland. I would have gone back for a second visit but time did not allow. Parking was no problem. The rainbow in the fall mist was a special treat. We got some great pics that may be enlarged and hung on walls here at home.It's a short hike on a well marked path to visit the falls - you can get very close on both sides by crossing a bridge. We were very happy that we included this on our day trip from Jasper.The power of these falls is something to behold! Some crazy people climbed over the protective railing to get a closer look - something I would not recommend! (Those who have slipped into the water have not survived!) Worth walking to the lower level to look back at the canyon created by the water.\"This one is too easy to not miss! From the road you can see the mist from the falls, but have no idea of its power until you're up close!\"Beautiful falls albeit small in comparison to Something like Niagara. Great photo opportunities and scenery is beautiful. Definitely worth visiting.When the river is high as it was when I visited the force of the water falling in such a small space is almost frightening. There is not much walking to see the attraction and it is worth a stop.Fantastic scenery and no need to hike for hours to get there. It does get crowded in the summer though;\"These are incredible waterfalls easily accessible from road that should not be missed. After long day of driving, it's great to get out and experience the beauty in person (but having bug spray helps).\"Tremendous falls well worth taking the time to see. The falls come from the Athabasca Glacier and have a lot of water going over them in the springtime. The surroundings are pretty too.Do not miss this amazing place which is easily accessible from car park. We loved seeing the power of the water.\"breath taking views and hikes down the falls.Make sure to take all routes around the falls as there are different views at each location\"\"The falls are not far from Jasper and an absolute highlight on a sunny day. Then, the water is crystal clear and with a light-blue shine, just breathtaking. There are walkways around the lower end of the falls as well to the base, offering a great many photo opportunitie.\"This was one of our favorites in Jasper National Park. The waterfall was strong and powerful and we saw a beautiful rainbow right on top of the waterfall. We also enjoyed the nice little hike. There is a lot of see here!\"We drove from Jasper to the Falls but missed it because there was no signs. They only put signs for people drove from Banff to the Falls not the other way.If you passed Mt. kerkeslin, then you passed the Falls.\"Very dramatic falls where you can see the action close up. It's a short walk from parking lot making it an easy to tour.\"The falls are very nice and many boards explain its formation but as it is accessed from the highway, pretty much everyone stops there for a while and it is very crowded.You can cross on the other side of the falls to get really close and get some refreshing spray from the falls, the kids loved getting a bit wet!\"\"A beautiful stop, right off the Ice Fields Parkway. Don't miss this and keep driving by. You could spend 5 minutes or an hour here, there were a few trails and different vantage points. The falls are magnificient.The infrastructure could maybe use a bit of upkeep, but parks infrastructure isn't a priority of our current government.Parking in the main lot was busy, but there was an upper, RV kind of lot that had lots of room if needed.\"\"Absolutely beautiful falls with water carved channels!A bit crowded at one point but the tour bus didnt stay too long.\"\"Were with a trip and this was one of the stopovers. It was amazing, we went on to the Glacier - a must if in the area.\"We stop here each time we come to Jasper regardless of the season. Always impressive. Phenomenal amount of water. Make sure to stop and check it out.I've now visited the Athabasca Falls twice. Both times the stop was well worth it. On this occasion we were also lucky enough to see a black bear. The kids enjoyed the break from driving and the walking around. Some great photos at this location and the information posted is also very good.\"This is by far the most impressive of the waterfalls in the Rockies and you can certainly see why it is the No 1 attraction. About 30 mins south of Jasper on the Icefields Parkway. The power of the water is incredible and the sink holes it has created; the rock formations are impressive. The river before them is also very pretty.Much of the area is paved and mostly accessible by wheelchair, but there is a further walk down by steps and trails. You should take a jacket as it was much cooler down there at the beginning of July.This is one you should make a point of visiting if you are on the Parkway.Hole in the ground style toilets - need baby wipes.\"\"when you are driving down the icefields parkway, this is certainly a must do stop, the waterfall is amazing and one of the biggest I've seen so far. When you are driving from jasper take 93a if you want to see some wildlife, if you're driving from lake louise take the exit to Athabasca Falls and drive the 93a to jasper if you want to see some wildlife ;)\"Wonderful attraction very close to parking. They have done an excellent job melding tourist accommodations (Pathways etc) and the beautiful rock formations and waterways of the Athabasca Falls.Recent rain made for an incredible water flow -- rainbow and all. Our photo touring group captured the area with videos and images. Worth the stop.the all around scenery was beautiful and many different areas to look at and see the view. The mist off of the falls was very refreshing and the pictures that we took were great as we saw a double rainbow from the mist and the way the sun hit it.Great Falls and walking paths. Loved it! the view is fantastic and there are lots of great photo opportunitiesWonderful falls close to Jasper and a definite stop on the Icefields Parkway. Amazing how the water has carved out the shapes in the rocks. Easy access to different viewpoints. It can be busy but you can still reach all the viewpoints.\"The falls are impressive,only short and easy stroll to get to them. Seeing the previous pathway of the water is a unique experience.\"\"When you're driving down the Icefields Parkway, make sure you do a quick stop at the Athabasca Falls. Watching the water thunder down the chasm, seeing the sprays and the rainbows...amazing!\"\"The Athabasca Falls were different from every angle, quite mysterious & very scary..difficult to get a photo that truly depicted the power of these falls.\"\"Very powerful falls, right off the main road. It's nice to walk down to the canyon and see the alternate route the river used to take. The short walk ends at a calm part of the river with a beautiful view\"The Athabasca Falls are a must see in Jasper. The pathways around the falls are well maintained and easy to walk on. We were able to see the falls from every angle. Visitors are able to get informed on the history and other interesting points by reading many large info boards along the way. We were glad we made the effort to see them.\"This is a definite must see, just seconds off the highway about 1/2 hour south of Jasper. Paved pathways and bridges allow you to see the water pounding through the narrow gorge. Especially impressive when the water is running high.\"we only had an hour and were glad we stopped here. beautiful falls - and pathway through former falls where you can see how the water carved through the rocks.\"Athabasca falls are not very high, but are very powerful. The site offers a very nice paved trail alongside and over the falls, allowing them to be seen top left and right, across, and bottom right. The trail has panels which explain the falls and the way they developed, as well as the impact on vegetation. There is even a walk down a canyon that used to be part of the falls which shows a large pothole. The water sprays in places which is refreshing on a summer day, but also makes the pathway slippery in places. Allow 45 minutes for the visit.\"These falls are spectacular. Be sure and see them for all advantages. Have been all over US and Europe and have seen many falls. These falls are only rivaled by some falls we saw in Switzerland that had 9 falls inside of a mountain!\"Amazing, wild waterfalls. You can get really close to them and they are awesome. The water was high due to the recent rains.\"This is a nice photo op but not much else since being right alongside the parkway you get scores of tour buses disgorging themselves from time-to-time which is annoying as most don't even speak English\"These are magnificent falls that can be viewed from a variety of positions. In addition, there is a trail through the trees - a good relief from the bright sunshine - but watch out for the mozzies. There are a number of points of information along the way that add interest to the walk. In places the spray from the falls reaches the paths so appropriate footwear is probably a good idea. Don't miss these falls when driving the Icefield Parkway.\"\"Only 30 minutes away from Jasper the waterfalls are quite spectacular. The power of the water is astonishing and you should definitely walk down the steps to the pot hole and the canyon. If you go to the other side of the bridge and look at the falls from the right side, there is usually a beautiful rainbow which really must be admired.\"\"Spectacular views!Easy trail from parking lot to falls. Not too busy Definitely worth the stop.Recommended for the whole family.\"There are many different levels to view the falls from and provides some great pictures. Wear appropriate shoes as most of the trails have water from the falls.Unbelievably beautiful. Words cannot describe how gorgeous this is. To be able to see a waterfall from start to finish is incredible. The information cards located along the walkways are very informative.\"There's nothing to dislike, unless you're too lazy to actually walk around and enjoy what this wonderful site has to offer.\"\"Good stop if you need to cover some distance but still want to see some things. Quick to hike into, about 10-15min. Really nice in the fall\"\"Loved the falls, they were beautiful, just wish it wasn't so chilly outside so we could enjoy them longer!\"\"If you are not blown away by the awesome spectacle and power of the Athabasca Falls, don't visit the Canadian Rockies!\"Great day trip from Jasper...we did it by Mountain Bike and truly enjoyed the scenery and the area. Saw a bear on the way... made the trip exciting.\"I'm used to paddling the top white-water rivers in the UK.This takes it to another level - not the most beautiful of falls (the review of Maligne Canyon still to come) but definitely the most impressive in terms of scale.\"\"Overall, Jasper is gorgeous. Athabasca falls are not too far from the city of Jasper, and they're easy to find. The falls themselves are not like Niagara Falls, but they are a different kind of beauty, with charm and very fitting for the mountains. Especially with the mountain backdrop ! There is a concrete path going around there so it's easy to get around. That and there are information signs telling you the history and info on the falls. You need to see the falls if you come to Jasper!\"\"Vey pretty, easy access and we saw BEARS three times between Jasper and the falls. A real highlight!\"\"These falls are great in that there are multiple ways to access them either by day hike, or by car if you aren't so inclined. Very pic worthy.\"just off the highway and mulitple viewing locations for some great falls. easy to get to and worth the short drive.\"Definitely plan a stop off here if you are driving along Hwy 93, there is lots of parking, really good access, and the falls themselves are very impressive. At the base of the falls is a large pool area with lots of boulders for kids...More\"It is well worth stopping to have a look at these falls. It is only a short walk to the first bridge and you can continue walking if you want\"I wasn't expecting to be so close to the waterfall - it was wonderful to feel the cool air movement and fine mist, caused by the immense power of the water crashing through the surrounding rocks. The information boards were fascinating and the whole area is a hikers delight. Great place to visit.I had to deduct one point, however, because the worst public toilets in Jasper National Park are on this site. All the others around the park are relatively clean, well serviced with loo paper and hand sanitizer, and they do not smell. Not so at Athabasca Falls and the smell inside the cabins was terrible. Don't be put off visiting the Falls because they are fabulous - just use the toilets en route, further down the road leading to the attraction.\"Easy to reach from the highway and accesible for all. Perfect place to take a picture while in Canada.\"can't describe the beauty of the falls , while gazing the athabasca falls with its water flowing the stairway sculptured rocks, a view of the beautiful multi- colored mountain also captured your attention.\"\"There are many viewpoints with minimal walking. We went during a period where there appeared to be a few tour buses stopped, however with a short walk we escaped the crowds and got a good view of the falls.\"\"The fall is just amazing, as good as Niagara but on a smaller scale. The walk down the canyon is worth the trip too.\"Athabasca falls is a fantastic stop on the Icefield Parkways. The water is so fast and loud and the gorge is mesmerising to look at! It's only a short walk to it from the car park which was handy. There are a good few nice little walks around too.I loved seeing Sumwapta Falls but then just a short time later we stopped at Athabasca Falls and that just topped the trip! I'd highly recommend stopping in and hiking around. There are several trails and lots of information about Athabasca Falls along the way. You really get a sense of just how powerful water is when you see the deeply gouged canyons. Definitely worth the trip!The spray from the thundering waterfalls was extremely refreshing on the day we visited. The double rainbows that could be seen in the spray were absolutely stunning. Make sure to make the stop and take in all its magnificence!This site is well worth the stop as well and make sure you take pictures as it is a falls to remember.The river was full making the falls more powerful than normal. Good to go in an evening but use mosquito repellent first!easy to get to and so beautiful ; one of the biggest falls that I have seen in a while so close up to it. you can walk in and stand on the bridge to feel the mist. you are looking over to it and down on it rather than up at it. A refreshing and free vista to put on your list when entering or leaving Jasper.Very impressive. Nice easy hike to see several different views. We didn't have a lot of time and were told this was a must see. Glad we took the time\"a nice thing to see when in the area. free access, quiet place for pique nique. paclards along the trails to explain phenomenon.\"I was biking by (from the States) and only decided to pull in to the Athabasca Falls at the last minute. Wow!\"Don't go out of your way to visit but if you are driving south of Jasper towards Banff, make this a half hour break, take your camera and go for a walk and enjoy the falls. Watch out for the busloads of Asian tourists who are swarming with their cameras, wanting their own private shots but not concerned about walking in front of your shots. Just go with it and enjoy the sights and the spray on a warm day.\"\"Well worth a visit, it makes you wonder where all the water is going, it does this every day of the year continually. A natural wonder in every way\"A must see. Impressive trail and bridges bring you close to this powerful waterfall. Amazing views. Worth the visit!!\"We stopped here for 20 minutes to stretch our legs and enjoy the fresh air. The falls are impressive and there are viewing platforms at various levels. You can see the sheer power of the water as it crashes through, and information signs tell the history of how the falls were created and ever-changing. A good discovery and one I would recommend seeing!\"Simply magnificent. Be certain to go down to the outflow where it opens out into a serene river and watch for the small animals that call this area home.\"Very impressive falls with great walking trails built around it. The falls are very close and very powerful, great way to witness the forces of nature (awe inspiring). Not the tallest falls but the volume of water and strength of the falls make up for that. Walk around the trails and you can get over to a rock beach where my kids built a little rock sculpture (others had already done some).\"A first stop of many on a day long coach journey from Jasper to Banff and only a short distance from the highway. A short easy walk brings you to the falls and there are viewing platforms at various heights to see the cascade from different angles. Well worth the stop and we could have stayed longer but the coach itinerary did not permit this unfortunately. Look out for orchids!. They are easy to miss. We found a few clumps of lovely mauve ones in full flower - it was the beginning of June.The falls are breathtaking and it definitely shows how powerful mother nature is. A definite must see when visiting Jasper.\"The falls are fantastic! I wish we could have only stayed longer! A definite MUST see!Everything you could ever imagine with such a powerful waterfall!\"\"If you are driving past, take 20 minutes out and stop off here. You will get some nice pics of these cute little waterfalls. Nothing too spectacular.\"\"We are so glad we visited these falls. Amazing, thundering massive volumes of water crashing over the waterfall and through the canyon. Spine tingling!\"\"Great experience, fantastic views plus good weather made this a great place to visit. Plenty of great photo opportunites\"There's a lot to see on the icefeilds parkway. I really recommend this stop. Its a stunning waterfall. The spray coming of it is insane.\"Amazing sights and sounds at this spectacular Falls. Wonderful photos to be takenTry and get there early before the coach parties arrive en-masse\"\"The scenery in the Rockies is spectacular overall and the Athabasca Falls, along with the many other waterfalls in the area, are no exception.\"This is an amazing place to visit. We visited Maligne Canyon the previous day so we had a good appreciation of how the canyons form etc. The track here is much shorter than Maligne Canyon and can be done in 20 minutes or so. You walk through a canyon and you can view the falls and the river from a number of viewing platforms. The falls are beautiful and the power of the water is quite spectacular. Well worth stopping for.Take the stairs down to the bottom of the falls and enjoy the rocky shoreline and whitewater rafters starting their journeyAmazing power of water!!! Easy to find with good parking. the falls were in full force in June due to melt water and the noise was thunderous.\"We were thrilled with the noise, spray, depth, force, view. Pictures do not do it justice. A must see on your trip to Jasper National Park. Wheelchair accessible. Picnic tables available. Bathroom facilities.\"\"You must visit the falls if you are in the area, they are massive with enormous volumes of water swirling down into the gorge below. There are a number of viewing platforms which give excellent views. Just astounding!\"Loved the sheer amazement of the Falls . Nature at its most powerful. The spray and roar of the water both excited and scared me! I have visions of this waterfall still in middle of night. So well worth a visit.\"Awesome falls, gorges and deep chasms. You can follow the river through a series of descents and walk a mile or so down the canyon. Each vista is different and beautiful.\"It is not a big fall but is nice Good opportunity for photo location. U can get quite close to the rapids. Liked the place in totalThe history of the falls was outstanding and the views spectacular. Don't miss this one! There are lovely walks to enjoy around the area and the weather was sunny on the day we went there so this made our photos even more fantastic.The rain made the river higher than usual so the falls were quite spectacular. Easy to walk around. Go down to the bottom to see the river bend after the falls.A must go in Jasper ! One of the easiest treks...they have stairs going down into the gorge. Brilliant views for pictures especially if you have a sunny day !easy safe walk around dramatic falls. Helpful informative signs. Definitely worth stopping to walk around and see these exciting falls.Easy access to the parking lot from the highway. Definitely set aside about 45 minutes to explore the falls from the various bridges and lookout points. The views are amazing!These falls are definitely worth a visit. The look of the falls change as you walk around. It is busy but people don't stay in one location too long so you can move in for pictures.A very pretty area with some pretty dramatic views of the canyon and falls. Its an area worth visiting if you have the chance.Fantastic spot. We visited the week of the floods in Alberta so the river was very high and powerful and a bit mucky! Definitely worth a visit. Go for a little wander around the paths.Breathtaking falls. Easy walk from the car park and well constructed viewing points. The water (Spring flooding) was amazing - well worth stopping for an hour just to take it all in.\"This was our first stop driving from Jasper to Banff. It was easy to find, well signposted and a good size carpark.We visited in August and they were flowing fast. The force produced is spectacular.There are a number of viewing platforms and trails to follow around the falls. All give you a different view and they are all amazing!!\"Always popular and excellent picture taking opportunity. I wandered up another path and saw a reminder of why people should not try to get too close to the falls -- a personal memorial. The paths were easy to navigate and walk up/dn.\"The sheer volume of water crashing to the bottom every second is simply incredible! Don't just take photos here - they may be worth a thousand words, but video clips of the action are worth millions of words!!!\"It is a must! very well organized and very close to the parking. The falls are seen from all directions - fantastic!!!!We visited while it was drizzling and the falls were really beautiful. There's a trail from the car park that goes near the falls and it's a short walk only.\"Not a massive water-fall, but very impressive! Great photos from many aspects. Very beautiful area and easy to get to. Well signed.\"Don't drive past this one. They are spectacular. You can do a short walk or a long one. Lots of photograph opportunities.Great time to go mid June when the snow and ice melt gives a torrent of water that is truely an awesome sight. Very easy to get to but pathways may be not easily managed by some. An amazing display of the beauty and force of nature and all for free.These falls need some time to walk around the pathways to truly experience their beauty. Great picture opportunities. Make an effort to stop in. You won't be disappointed.\"Worth a stop off if passing, the falls were in full flow with the meltwater and there are good viewing points. My only criticism woud be the design of the walkways which seemed o be built in concrete and seemed at odds with the natural environment, design flaw maybe?\"\"Short walk to the falls, and beautiful picture opp's. Short drive from Jasper which was convenient as well.\"\"So much to see and do,many,many photo opportunities,good paths and information stops,easy walk from car park,the colour of the water in some parts of the falls is amazing\"\"Compared to most waterfalls, this one has an extensive (but accessible) trail network that allows you to see the falls from many different angles and even allows you to cross the river to see the falls from both sides. Definitely worth a stop if you are on the Icefields Parkway.\"Certainly a must see on any trip to Jasper - I was surprised at the large crowds as we hadn't seen a lot of people until this point in our trip. The falls are spectacular and you'd be missing something wonderful if you didn't stop. Easy to do this in 30-45 minutes and take it all in - bring the camera. We were disappointed in the number of people that did not respect the signs warning them to staff off the rocks and the number of people that climbed the fence.These falls are beautiful! The force of the water is amazing and the photos looked great with the mountains in the background.There are a number of great views plus information panels. You can see how the power of the Sunwapta River has carved through the rock.\"What a fabulous place. We took heaps of photos, and the combination of mountains, falls, rivers etc made it a must go to place. Our visit was topped off with a close encounter with several deer who, while wild, are obviously used to tourists on their patch.\"\"This is a beautiful waterfall and you can walk some trails to see it from various viewpoints. Since this is a Canadian National Park, you never pay entry fees to see the sites. Certainly well worth the stop.\"\"A must see site on Highway 93 from Banff to Jasper as the falls are formed on the Athabasca River in the form of an hour glass. The wide river narrows into a canyon at the falls and the rock carvings are created by the sand and gravel rubbing at high speed with the rock face and creating a deep crevice. The downstream side of the fall is also very beautifu, A must-see.\"\"Don't miss this place. See the beautifully carved rock canyon walls. Be astounded by the ongoing battle of rushing water against hard rocks. If you are short of time, a quick visit will take about 30 to 45 minutes..\"\n"

car park to the viewing platforms at the top so this attraction is suitable for strollers and wheelchairs.It is a nice little climb down the stairs, through the gorge to the bottom for a different

rivers in this part of Canada, but this was just amazing, if not one of the best we saw.', 'This is situated at the Jasper end of the Icefield Parkway and really did set the scene for what was to

Jasper.', 'We planned make a stop here on our way from Lake Louise, but decided to delay the stop until the day we drive back to Yoho, and that was a good decision, as we would not have had enough

bottom.', '\"\"Once again, this country just keeps on giving with scenery, absolutely spectacular.', 'The Athabasca Falls were amazing, so much to see and take in, I would recommend stopping here for

easy to find, well signposted and a good size carpark.We visited in August and they were flowing fast.', 'The force produced is spectacular.There are a number of viewing platforms and trails to follow around the falls.', 'All give you a different view and they are all amazing!!', '\"Always popular and excellent picture taking opportunity.', 'I wandered up another path and saw a reminder of why people should not try to get too close to the falls -- a personal memorial.', 'The paths were easy to navigate and walk up/dn.', '\"The sheer volume of water crashing to the bottom every second is simply incredible!', \"Don't just take photos here - they may be worth a thousand words, but video clips of the action are worth millions of words!!!\", '\"It is a must!', 'very well organized and very close to the parking.', 'The falls are seen from all directions - fantastic!!!', '!We visited while it was drizzling and the falls were really beautiful.', \"There's a trail from the car park that goes near the falls and it's a short walk only.\", '\"Not a massive water-fall, but very impressive!', 'Great photos from many aspects.', 'Very beautiful area and easy to get to.', 'Well signed.', '\"Don\\'t drive past this one.', 'They are spectacular.', 'You can do a short walk or a long one.', 'Lots of photograph opportunities.Great time to go mid June when the snow and ice melt gives a torrent of water that is truely an awesome sight.', 'Very easy to get to but pathways may be not easily managed by some.', 'An amazing display of the beauty and force of nature and all for free.These falls need some time to walk around the pathways to truly experience their beauty.', 'Great picture opportunities.', 'Make an effort to stop in.', \"You won't be disappointed.\", '\"Worth a stop off if passing, the falls were in full flow with the meltwater and there are good viewing points.', 'My only criticism woud be the design of the walkways which seemed o be built in concrete and seemed at odds with the natural environment, design flaw maybe?', '\"\"Short walk to the falls, and beautiful picture opp\\'s.', 'Short drive from Jasper which was convenient as well.', '\"\"So much to see and do,many,many photo opportunities,good paths and information stops,easy walk from car park,the colour of the water in some parts of the falls is amazing\"\"Compared to most waterfalls, this one has an extensive (but accessible) trail network that allows you to see the falls from many different angles and even allows you to cross the river to see the falls from both sides.', 'Definitely worth a stop if you are on the Icefields Parkway.', '\"Certainly a must see on any trip to Jasper - I was surprised at the large crowds as we hadn\\'t seen a lot of people until this point in our trip.', \"The falls are spectacular and you'd be missing something wonderful if you didn't stop.\", 'Easy to do this in 30-45 minutes and take it all in - bring the camera.', 'We were disappointed in the number of people that did not respect the signs warning them to staff off the rocks and the number of people that climbed the fence.These falls are beautiful!', 'The force of the water is amazing and the photos looked great with the mountains in the background.There are a number of great views plus information panels.', 'You can see how the power of the Sunwapta River has carved through the rock.', '\"What a fabulous place.', 'We took heaps of photos, and the combination of mountains, falls, rivers etc made it a must go to place.', 'Our visit was topped off with a close encounter with several deer who, while wild, are obviously used to tourists on their patch.', '\"\"This is a beautiful waterfall and you can walk some trails to see it from various viewpoints.', 'Since this is a Canadian National Park, you never pay entry fees to see the sites.', 'Certainly well worth the stop.', '\"\"A must see site on Highway 93 from Banff to Jasper as the falls are formed on the Athabasca River in the form of an hour glass.', 'The wide river narrows into a canyon at the falls and the rock carvings are created by the sand and gravel rubbing at high speed with the rock face and creating a deep crevice.', 'The downstream side of the fall is also very beautifu, A must-see.', '\"\"Don\\'t miss this place.', 'See the beautifully carved rock canyon walls.', 'Be astounded by the ongoing battle of rushing water against hard rocks.', 'If you are short of time, a quick visit will take about 30 to 45 minutes..\"']\n"
