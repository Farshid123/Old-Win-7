"We woke up in our hotel and it had snowed overnight and thought it might spoil our day but on the contrary it was a great day out. On the spectacular drive up to Maligne Lake, we saw Moose, Carabou, Chipmunk, and a cheaky bird. When we got there in the snow we were surprised at the number of cars in the car park. Being dark and murky day the lake was still very photogenic and quite spectacular. Didn't go on the boat trip as it was quite cold and my wife and daughter hate cold. Decided to warm up in the café and had sandwiches and a warm coffee, All in all a great day out including the drive to the lake. Highly recommended, in all weather."
"The drive to Maligne Lake takes about 1-hr each way and offers some beautiful scenery. Take your time and stop at the road-side pull-outs for photos and to appreciate the displays. The Lake itself was absolutely stunning, the day we visited. While all of the services had already closed up for the season, we were able to walk around the shoreline and enjoy the views!"
"The beauty of this lake almost seems unreal. We were able to take a boat out to Spirit Island, and the ride was so fun. The boat captain and the guide were very friendly. The stay near Spirit Island was a little short, but it was a memorable experience."
"A nice drive to Maligne Lake. The boat tour seems to be the main thing to do here, and we did not book the tour in advance. Unfortunately we didn't make it back another day, so I can't comment, other than we would have like to have gone. Instead we walked along the shore and visited the gift shop. Lots of lunch options here. Make sure you look for any of the Parks Canada people around the lake - they are very educational - we learned so much and the kids were able to ask all kinds of questions."
If you visit Jasper then you will more than likely be visiting Maligne Lake Make sure you do the boat trip to Spirit Island while you are there. It's a beautiful drive and you can see some lovely scenery and also the devistation from bush fires in the area.
This is one of the most beautiful places I have ever been. Francois and Morgan were both wonderful tour guides
"This is a beautiful lake with some great walking trails. This is our second time there, and this time, we saw nine moose all together! Here is a current photo as of October 21st."
Maligne lake has an amazing view. A must stop for everyone visiting Japer. The blue colour of the lake is breathtaking.
"Drove down to Maligne Lake whilst staying in Jasper. Boat trip to Spirit Island is expensive, but do not miss it. This is quite simply possibly the most naturally beautiful place I have ever visited. Awesome. There are a number of well marked walks - we walked to Lake Mona & back. The gift shop & cafe are fine but the whole place is simply stunning & time should be spent simply taking in the scenery."
"Beautiful landscape. I had no idea that anything could be this pretty! Spectacular place. Canadians have a wonderful, special place. Thank you for letting us share this special landscape."
"I visited maligne lake late September and it was absolutely beautiful. We did the Mary Schaffer loop and were lucky enough to come across a male moose along the way. There were several other hiking trails leading off from the main area and also frequent cruises on the lake up to spirit island. The spirit island cruise was beautiful and takes you to an area of the lake, surrounded by glaciers, where you can view spirit island. The tour not only provided beautiful views but also the tour guides were very knowledgable and keen to answer any questions you may have."
"My husband and I visited Maligne Lake just after they had some snow. Hiking around the lake was very difficult and most of the trails were closed. We went on the cruise and were not really sure what to expect. What a surprise to experience such great scenery and views of Spirit Island. From memory the price was a little on the expensive side, however the experience of seeing this little island was worth the cost."
"Nice beautiful lake and starting point to take cruises to the Spirit Island. Would need to arrive here sooner if interested in going to Spirit Island via cruises or kayaking. We did the Moose Lake loop which takes about an hour and it took us to the secluded Moose Lake (take bug spray), a nice small lake."
"A bit shocked at the price, as the lake, on a dull day, didn't initially look anything special, but as we got towards the glacier, the water changed colour and once on Spirit Island you just couldn't stop taking picture after picture. Excellent scenery, and informative and friendly guide on the boat"
"Another lake set in pine forests?....yes. Beautiful?......yes. Mountain back drop?......yes. Anything special?....yes.Touring around the Rockies there are plenty of lakes to see. We came to this one travelling down Maligne Lake Road where there is an abundance of wildlife to be seen just on the roadside (allegedly, because we didn't see any very disappointingly) after approximately 45mins. It is a large lake which you can, unfortunately, not walk around. There were boat trips but these were expensive and I'm not sure they would be worth it. You basically chugged up and down the Lake so a great relax (if the weather was right) but if you are able save some money and do one of the trails of various difficulty. Some have better paths than others make sure you pick ones that suit your clothing/footwear. Some are more casual type strolls others require effort. We started with the Mary Schaffer loop which skirts the edge of the lake and then goes up into the woods. The trail signage goes missing in the woods and we met another couple who had turned back as they were unsure whether they had missed a turn. Persevering we continued and found we had hit it right luckily. It took approx 1.5hrs gentle stroll (a few steeper bits and probably not suitable for a pram) but young children would manage. A quick bite to eat in the reasonably priced cafe/gift shop and then we did the Skyline trail which was a bit steeper and longer and away from Maligne Lake. It takes you to 2 other lakes secreted in the forest- Mona Lake (bigger and more interesting) and Lorraine Lake. This was a very peaceful trail when we were there. Very little noise, very few people and very peaceful."
"Jasper national park offers 3 ingredients: ice peaks, woods and lakes. Maligne is just another lake in the same setting as all the others. They offer a boat tour on the lake for 72 canadian dollar per person. This is not worth your money."
"The lake sure is nice. But its nothing compared to the hike you can take up the bald hill. If you have the time, about 4-5 hours, you need to hike up there"
"Malinge lake is nice, and there is an easy trail along the shore (unfortunately not around the whole lake) that allows many picture opportunities.One of our highlights was a short 1km trail called The Moose Lake Trail.An easy walk of around 30 mins return (same way) from the lake into the woods.It ends up at a little lake with mooses that stare at you and... keep on nibbling whatever they find in the water.CHARMING"
Worth seeing and the drive up there is enjoyable with plenty of photo opportunities. Its about a 30 mile drive so we just had time to see it as our schedule was tight. Pleased we did it as the lake is beautiful . We saw a moose in the lake so that caused excitement from a few people. The highlight is the boat trip. There's a very nice café and gift shop rest rooms etc. Could imagine the car park gets quite full in summer as we had to use the overflow. We had a little walk round the lake but it was very busy. Well worth seeing.
"Fun trip out to spirit island with Kai and Alexis as our guides. Informative guides!
The scenery cannot be beat."
"Where can you see and smell the outdoors at its best . Pristine wilderness untouched . Clean air and you can actually be in nature surrounded with its beauty. Wildlife from bears to wolves even elk and Moose. You can take a boat cruise to the famous spirit island or hike lots of trails . Swim or canoe tonplaces designated to camp at. Also p,acevto have a great picnic lunch atbtoo bring your own irveat there. There is a gift shop for your little souvenirs etc . Staff are helpful and friendly . Great place"
The long drive to the lake is quite stunning - we were lucky as the road had just opened after 18 ins of snowfall quite exceptional in the middle of September. Lots of stops on the way to photograph the medicine lake and some moose. The lake cruise was pricey but well worth it - getting a window seat enabled photos to be taken from the open window. The commentary during the cruise was informative but also chatty.
"This is a bit of a drive from Jasper along a very interesting mountain road. We went in the afternoon and saw lots of wildlife (moose, elk, white-tailed and mule deer). A variety of trails around the area, with lots of different views of the surrounding mountains. Didn't feel the need to do the cruise, although we have been told it is lovely. Plenty of parking, restaurant, gift shop and washrooms on site."
Wonderful boat trip out on the lake and get out at Spirit island. Stunning views..gorgeous clear water.Lively commentary from the two girls on our boat.Try and get a window seat and open window for best photos.Toilet at Spirit island was most expensive to install in whole of Canada.Trip takes 90 minutes.
The lake was huge. We took a 2-hour premium boat tour and were able to see the peaks around in the deep valley of the lake around the famous Spirit Island (the island was not really as pretty as is hyped).
"The guide says everyone seems to want to go in the morning, but the light is better in the afternoon for pictures, and I'd have to agree. Get your tickets in advance as every cruise sells out in the the high season. We made a full day of Maligne Canyon road ---we did the canyon, enjoyed several stops like Medicine Lake, and made it all the way to the end of the road for our lake cruise in the afternoon. We did the extra-something tour that let us stop for a bit at Spirit Island. On the way out we really enjoyed the guide's talk and the mountains flanking the lake. But, the best views really are at the Spirit Island end of the lake --- just terrific. A couple of people actually took a quick dip in the lake, but darn it was too cold for me!"
"The receptionist in the Swanridge Hotel persuaded us that this was the best thing to do in and around Jasper, especially as we were there on the wrong day to take the steel rails.He arranged the booking for a ""reasonable"" time in the morning and insisted we watch out for the nesting bald eagles on the way. We saw them! Or at least one of them.We arrived at Maligne Lake well in time for our departure. Unfortunately the view was obscured by the incoming smoke haze from British Columbia. Not to matter as we were well distracted by our guide and pilot. Full of knowledge and good fun. We thoroughly enjoyed the island visit. Did not see a bear but watched a Beka making its nest for the winter.The boat trip was a great recommendation."
"We arrived early for a 10am boat to Spirit island. The trip was delayed by a fog halfway up the lake but we weren't delayed long and were kept updated throughout the wait. When we got going it was more than worth it. We would like to personally thank our guide Luis and ""Captain"" Alexis who were very friendly and informative. We had a remarkable and very special trip that we will never forget."
"We arrived in glorious sunshine following a day of heavy snow so it was really picturesque. The snow did mean that some of the paths were very slippy but we made it round to the viewpoint which was worth it. If you can do a cruise, go for it. They'd sold out by the time we got there so book online if you can."
"If you came to see just the lake, there is very little to actually see. We took the boat ride and tour. The boat tour is around 1 1/2 hours long. We spent around 30 minutes visiting Spirit Island, which is one of the most beautiful spots I have ever visited. Our tour guide on the boat was not very good. She was very had to hear and understand and was not very interesting. You see several glaciers from the boat."
"Amazing and a MUST to visit the lake and take the cruise to spirit island. you cannot be in Jasper and not visiting this lake and the spirit island, something will be missing.there are few hike that you can take here, some are easy and others more difficult. you can ask at the gift shop/ ticket office about the trails and a map.the trails are not accessible by a stroller.and you can rent canoes and there is a restaurant here"
"This is a beautiful, quiet lake that was enjoyable to do a hike along. It is crowded in near but the parking lot, boat rental shop and area, but is different as you hike away from the crowds. Many scenic spots and views. Boat prices were seemed too high to us to bother renting one. Spend the time hiking.."
"Once we found a place to park, the walk to the lake was short and offered scenic views. We checked out the boat prices which seemed rather high, so decided against boating. So we just sat down and enjoyed the view, which was peaceful."
Probably you here about this if you are searching for information about what things to do... but!! I strongly recommend you to spent a time of your visit on sailing this lake... either yourself or doing an excursion in ships...
"Well worth the trip down the valley to see the lake, take in some coffee and a bite and drink in the stunning views."
"The scenery around Maligne Lake was fantastic and arguably the most beautiful of our entire holiday in the Rockies. We started off by taking the short 15 min walk along the shore to the Mary Schaffer viewpoint via the historic (1926) boathouse. We eventually decided to take the boat trip. This was quite expensive but well worth the money as the exquisite views are at the end of the lake and only otherwise accessible by a long hike. I would suggest that you take the premium cruise as this one gives you more opportunity for photography and time on the shore near Spirit Lake, which is apparently one of the most photographed spots in the Rockies. The staff on the boat trip made us welcome and were very knowledgeable about the area including its history and its links to the First Nation peoples. I would particularly like to mention Amber, Francois and Michelle who were great. Lake Maligne is the longest natural one in the Canadian Rockies and almost 100 metres deep in places. This is definitely a not-to-be missed 5 plus star attraction.If you can book the boat trip in advance to avoid having to wait a few hours in the peak season."
"We came here as part of a tour group - some of whom went on the lake cruise (but that's for them to review).There is easy parking and a short walk brings you to the edge of the lake - the view was wonderful with the clouds hanging over the surrounding mountains. There were plenty of trails to walk around or near the lake but time prevented us exploring to far. There was a place to higher boats/canoes/etc and the lake cruise was bookable on site. (Note: most trips were fully booked when we arrived so if this is what you want to do prebook it).There were information boards giving interesting information about people and places.The facilities were good - food, toilets, info and shops.But above all the beauty of the place makes it a worthwhile trip."
"We took the boat cruise, guided by Cam and Luis. It was great! The guys were full of information about the area and it was absolutely breath taking views."
A MUST see....take the walk around the lake or rent a canoe....water is turquoise and the mountains are snow-capped and beautiful
"The trip to the lake is marvellous. We saw plenty wild life, however not one caribou. At the lake we strolled the Mary Shaffer loop, had our picknick, exchanged our pre-booked tickets and boarded the tourboat. The fast boat takes you to Spirit Island and Back. The tour guide gave plenty of clear information during the trip. On our way back to Jasper we encountered some more wildlife. All in all a very good way to spend the day"
"Stunning surroundings but Maligne lake didnt do anything special for me, having been on minnewanka, Louise and emerald i didnt get any urges to kayak it."
"The two best drives from Jasper:1) Maligne Canyon 2) Route 16 towards HintonThe beauty of the Lake Maligne drive, and the Lake itself are astounding.At Maligne Lake, take the Moose Lake Trail. It's easy and you may actually see a moose!There was one just before we arrived at the Lake (sadly, we missed it, but they love the water vegetation at this small lake)."
"My wife and I spent the day at Maligne Lake. We decided to go Kayaking.....10 mins in, my wife capsized her kayak, falling into the ice cold water. I managed to get her to the shore. The staff were immediately there to help, they rushed her inside, wrapped her up in blankets and took her somewhere to tumble dry her clothes.Michelle was an absolute star, checking she was okay, drying her clothes and giving her a hot drink to warm her up. Thank you so much for the excellent care you showed my wife, with the water that cold it could have been dangerous for her to stay in wet clothes all day, especially with the shock as well.Despite this hiccup, with Michelle's help, we were able to enjoy our premium lake cruise which was jaw droppingly beautiful. Again with very friendly and informative staff, Francois and Amber were excellent tour guides."
"I wish we could have stayed longer here. Our limited time allowed us to do the Mary Schaffer Trail, a quick picnic lunch and then we boarded the cruise to Spirit Island. There are multiple trails here and, judging by the Mary Schaffer, I'm guessing all beautiful. Take a day and picnic lunch and spend some time here - the views are gorgeous. Lots of parking, too --"
"Boat tour is definitely worth it but on site restaurant and gift shop was overpriced, extremely crowded and generally unclean and in serious need of renovation."
nice lake that offers canoing and a nice restaurant and gift shop but the mountains were covered in smoke so hard to enjoy .. there is a nice walk back to the highway on the bridge we had lunch on the nice deck ...worth seeing
This lake is absolutely stunning. The mountains in the background with the boat house in the front is amazing! We would've liked a boat tour but didn't have the time. The lakes colour is unfortunately only as intense in the sun (which we unfortunately didn't have). But the walkways near and around the lake are gorgeous no matter the weather!
"A beautiful morning drive to the Canyon and lake.At 2 to 4 degrees Celsius it was crisp, with a little sleet/snow. The canyon walk from bridge to bridge was quite nice but the lake was amazing. So glad we had the opportunity to see it.Recommend travellers head there first thing in the morning- beat the buses. Nothing worse than other people in your scenic photos."
"We had a great boat trip to Spirit Island with Sauannah and Amber, it was so romantic a young couple got engaged!"
"This is a really beautiful spot, so much quieter than L Louise, and worth the drive to it. Had excellent guides/boat crew Sarah and Kai. Full of information and stories!
Go early. Good loos in the shop/cafe."
"Excellent trip down to Spirit Island with amazing views, with Scott and Josh driving us and keeping us informed. Quite a high price, but the whole experience very well organized."
"A beautiful area, with some good hikes. The landscape is best appreciated from the middle of the lake."
"Definitely worth travelling up to Maligne Lake. The scenery is fantastic and the colour of the emerald waters changes in different light.
The boat trip to the island is worth doing as you get better views of the mountain ranges and the glaciers."
This is a pretty lake with some easy walking trails right by the lake. Despite the number of people visiting the Lake it was very quiet on the trails. There are commercial boat cruises to Spirit Island. We visited on a very smoky day ( smoke from extensive western wild fires can cover the sky and sun) so we were not able to see the lake in all its glory.
"Was a lovely boat ride with guide Scott, who gave a comprehensive description about its history. It took 30 minutes to arrive at the island where you can take photos. The boat has seating inside the cabin and standing outside. I highly recommend it."
"Maligne Lake was pretty beautiful. This was one of the first destinations that required some advanced booking / planning. We took the boat cruise, because that's the only way to get to Spirit Island. Apparently call it an island, but it's a bit of a misnomer, because for most of the year, it's more of an isthmus, as you can see in the photo above. Having that walk around Spirit Island was really great. Beautiful photo opportunities.Spirit Island has a storied history and significance, especially to the indigenous people who used to live in this area. They believe they can communicate with their Gods and ancestors from that plot of land. The tour guide said that when these indigenous were pushed out of the Maligne area, back in the day, they believed that the Gods were upset about them abandoning the area. Soon after they left, there was a major forest fire that destroyed huge segments of the park. To appease the Gods, the people made a journey back to Spirit Island for some prayers and peace."
"We took the Spirit Island boat trip and it was with every penny! Our guide, Amber, really made the trip memorable. Her insight into the history of the area and the vibe she brought the whole expedition was infectious and gave a sense of collectivity to our group. She even encouraged me to jump in the water which, in hindsight, I would have regretted not doing immensely. Spirit Island is rich with history and the area around it has a sense of grandeur. Do it if you are in the area!"
"Absolutely loved this place, it was gorgeous, very quiet and serene. We were one of the first buses to arrive, so we were very fortunate - pretty much had the place to ourselves. I could have spent the entire day taking photos, it seemed as every turn offered another fabulous shot. Very nice stop on our tour of the Canadian Rockies, nice snack set out by our bus driver."
"Go in the afternoon when all the other tourists are gone! Then you unfortunately cannot take a boattour, but you can enjoy the breathtaking views."
"We booked as part of a package, so wasn't too bad value.
Stunning scenery and some great background info from the guide. I have to admit I was a bit underwhelmed by Spirit Island though."
Horrible service. Apparently there was fog earlier in the morning and we got bumped off our premium tour and had to wait for next regular seat.7 tix*$25 price difference =$175 loss.Front girl had no idea how to manage offset schedule and was just acting frustrated and ignorant.Boat staff excellent.Manager decent for tough day.No solutions though
"We went here for a picnic. There is many picnic tables here so we didn't have a problem getting to relax and have a nice lunch. The lake is very picturesque and has a nice trail to walk around. If you want to take the Maligne Lake boat tour, I would suggest booking in advance as it was all booked up when we tried to take a tour.Drive into the lake is very pretty passing areas such as Medicine Lake which was a nice stop as well.Maligne Lake also has a restaurant and gift shop for those who like to indulge in these activities.There was washroom facilities set up in the parking area and at the restaurant.Parking is free, but limited when it is busy but there was a overflow area when we were there."
"Maligne lake is a great place to visit but if you want to really take a full 'experience' don't miss the boat trip. we took the 1,5 hours trip and was great."
"We saw a mule deer and a black bear when driving on the road to the lake. We passed by the entrance for Maligne Canyon and Medicine Lake to see the big lake first and stopped at those other places on our way back out. There are many trails to choose from at the lake, but we picked the easy Mary Schaeffer trail which passed next the shore line for a while before heading inland and uphill. The trail was dotted with several interesting informational plaques. Once the trail headed away from the lake, we decided to turn around and head back the way we came. There's a nice visitors' center at one end of the lake with a good selection of sandwiches, pastries, etc. and a great view, if you decide to eat there.We didn't take the boat tour. Canoe rentals are also available."
We visited on a Sundog tour which included Maligne canyon & Medicine Lake. We went on the lake to Spirit Island. I'll try to put separate review but it was excellent. Wonderful young guide. Unfortunately the mountains were obscured by smoke haze from forest fires in BC but it was nonetheless magical. You mustn't miss this spot especially if you can't get to Lake Louise.
"A huge picturesque turquoise lake. We loved the boat cruise to the famous Spirit Island. It is so magnificently beautiful! There is a Premium Cruise where you disembark to the island, HOWEVER you're not permitted to walk on Spirit Island. In 3 minutes, 6 people tromped on the island. There really should have been someone advising this is detrimental. It should be mentioned during ticket sale, on the boat, and with signage on the boat, and the dock, and on path to the island. Guide was yelling at him to little avail. Cruise Guide Savannah and Captain Maria were amazing!"
"This felt like a really long drive and I almost wanted to turn around. Lake is beautiful. There was an outhouse in the parking lot so i used it. Such a mess I was disappointed for visitors. BUT, there are flush toilets in the coffee shop building. The prices were ridiculously high- $4 for a supermarket donut so I would suggest bringing a lunch or snacks with you. Boat tours are $65 a person but there are deals if you book in advance."
"This was so pretty, could spend all day taking photos. Very nice stop on our tour of the Canadian Rockies."
A wonderful drive up to the lake. Spend some time to find out about the history of the lake and how it was discovered. Won't say more - have the fun of discovering for yourself!Walk around and lake and into the woods. Find the wildlife along the way.
"This lake is a must. one of the most beautieful lakes we saw during our trip. the trip on the lake by boat is a ""must"" although very expensive (75CAD pP) but is really worth it. the scenery is incredible. it takes approx 90 minutes. the stop of 10-15 mins at the Spirit Island is too short and could be longer. we took the first boat at 0900am in the morning so everything was calm."
"I'm only giving this lake two stars as record-setting wildfires in British Columbia flew into this area and obscured all the mountain views. Because the smoke was so bad, we didn't even attempt the boat trip. The Mary Schaffer Loop was the lakefront trail to hike."
Very pleasant place to stroll around the lake ... it can get crowded with the demand of the boat tours and the canoe boats ... timing is everything with early morning or later in the day being best for lighting and crowds .. see photos
"one of the highlights of jasper is the view from there. you can comfortably sit and watch people paddling canoes, partake in hikes or just absorb"
"Get there in the morning before the crowds to get a car park space and to enjoy the location in peace. Head to walks along the lake, Moose lake is peaceful as you leave the crowds behind."
"We discovered Maligne Lake at the end of our last holidays in Jasper. At our return this year, we immediately returned to this beautiful place. It takes you about an hour to drive down the Maligne Lake Road from Jasper. Take your time and check for wildlife along the way - we have seen elk, deer and bear plus lots of little things like squirrel, ground squirrel and chipmunks. At the lake you will be met with business and crowds of people. If you prefer to enjoy the lake and the quietness, take the trail that leads along the shoreline into the forest. For most of the time it is fairly easy to walk and gives you beautiful perspectives on the mountains and the lake. Loons and Red-necked Grebes are common on the lake, keep your eyes open for them. The lake is especially beautiful in the evening hours (after 5:30) when the crowds retreat and it is getting more quiet around the lake. The evening sun will let the mountains glow and add to the serenity of the place. The restaurant at the lake is pretty overpriced and if you are smart, you bring yourself a snack."
"This is a massive lake, and if you're not a serious paddler (you wouldn't get far by hiring a canoe from the boat house for one hour) the best way to see it is through the motorised boat tours. We left it a little late booking, the day before, so could only get 8 of us on the first 8.45am boat, but this turned out to be a result as we were the first on Spirit Island and docked to find a deer and its fawn by the jetty. The lake is beautiful, Spirit Island is also a very special place, and all in all the boat trip was well worth doing. Facilities on shore - cafe, car parks etc - were good compared to other lakes, and not overrun as we found elsewhere. We also did a couple of short walks around the lake - the Mousse Lake trail and the Mary Schaffer loop. The Mousse Lake trail is more uneven and goes away from the lake itself, but we saw an elk and baby and I think the chances of seeing wildlife are higher on this one. Mary Schaffer loop follows the lake around before looping back - also a nice walk."
"We opted to not take the boat cruise, and still, we enjoyed our hike around the shoreline of this beautiful lake. If you want to see Spirit Island, one of the most photographed areas in the world, you'll have to purchase the boat ride! We enjoyed a nice lunch in the cafeteria before heading away. Go early before all the busses arrive!"
"From the majestic peaks to the glacier/blue hue of the water, it was the MOST incredible paddle. I already had a canoe, but you can rent kayaks or canoes at the little lodge. Spirit Island is far, but worth an entire day experience. If you don't have that much oomph, just go to the mouth of the Maligne river. Tiny beaches and all sorts of areas to stop and rest. One of the most beautiful trips EVER"
"From Jasper, the 27 miles (44 kilometers) drive is a paved road through a forest. There are multiple opportunities to see ""critters"" although the dudes in a massive hurry, ignoring the speed limit, apparently think their schedule is more important than the lives of wildlife. A cruise on Maligne Lake(14 miles long, 334 feet deep and famous for the green and blue colours of its waters), taking approx. 2 hours. The boat stops at Spirit Island, letting people off to walk around the island foreshore. Take your bug spray. The crew explain the geology and interesting facts about the lake. Back at the dock there is a terrific Cafe with meals/snacks/hot drinks. Restrooms are inside. The ticket office doubles as a Gift Shop. Parking is free. A great day out."
"Visited here today, so picturesque and peaceful. Easy to reach from Jasper, saw some Caribou on the side of the road on the way."
"Maligne Lake holds some of the best views in The Canadian Rockies. The Canadian Rockies aren't really a secret. You've most definitely heard of this lake, the hype is definitely real. As you arrive at Maligne, the blue will absolutely blow you away. We quickly boarded our boat with excitement, and were greeted by the largest most kind smile from our guide Amber. Her energy created the most wonderful atmosphere. Throughout our tour, she spoke in a manner so that all ages could understand and still be intrigued. Her knowledge of the formation of the Rockies, significant explorers, lakes, animals, and ecosystem is outstanding. You can hear her passion and love for this magical place when she speaks. As we arrived at Spirit Island, everyone went to take pictures and explore. Amber took time to point out specific plants native to the area. The most beautiful views I have ever seen. You also spot over 3 glaciers on this trip, a jewel in the Rockies. On the way back any questions were answered perfectly. Amber took the time to walk around and speak with every person on the boat. She made the entire tour, truly capturing the unique beauty of this gemThank you Amber!"
"The cruise to Spirit Island was informative and so peaceful. Amber was the captain and Lauren was the guide. Both were excellent! There was a narrated motor boat ride there, then some time to walk around to take photos. What extraordinary sights of so many mountains, in the same mountain range, surrounding us in this box canyon!"
"Located 50 kms from the town of Jasper the drive to Maligne Lake is just part of the beauty you experience by going there. Stop at Medicine Lake to stretch your legs and enjoy the magnificent view - maybe you'll get lucky and see some animals! i've seen eagles ... sheep.... bears and moose at one time or another along this road. Once you get to the lake you can go for a hike.... have a picnic at one of many picnic tables close to the lake... go on the boat tour or enjoy the gift shop and cafe. I like to picnic here and enjoy watching the tour boats, canoes and kayaks go by. It's one of my favourite places to go in the park although the best time to go is usually evenings as there are far less people there once the tours are done for the day"
The views are stunning if you go on a nice and clear day. When we went there was lot of haze due to the fire in BC. But nonetheless we had a great time on the boat tour. We took the premium tour which includes guided walk on the spirit island and that was a nice touch as you get to know the history behind the spirit island and get some time to spend on the island as well.
Maligne Lake was an afternoon after thought but well worth the visit with a simple but beautiful drive from Jasper. Nice hike around the lake with cafe giftshop etc. Lake cruises are available. Smoky from wild fires on our visit but certainly not like that normally.
"Though you may take a brief visit to this lake, still you will be attracted to her natural beauty. On a clear and windless day, the reflection of the snowy mountain in the water is really charming."
"A small piece of paradise on earth. It is quant destination, and oh so picturesque. The boat cruise is amazing; the guides are well informed and will answer all of your questions without hesitation."
So beautiful and the girls who drove the boat and guided us were very knowledgeable and friendly. We went to Spirit Island from where you can get some very good pictures. The waters were calm and beautiful and we had a meal in the restuarant beside it afterwards which was very good. Just be careful of the midges if you walk round!
We arrived early to go on the 9am Spirit Island boat cruise. I wasn't sure what to expect but all I can say is Wow!! Amazing!! I would suggest arriving early as this is another place that gets extremely busy. There is lots of parking but it will get crowded. Well worth the visit!!
Nice size lake but it was not our favorite. Looks just like any other lake. Several better ones to visit. Make it a quick stop but don't linger.
"we took a 2 hour walk around the lake and found ourselves walking into the woods and then into the noise of a bear, there are park attendents around the lake and an amazing bakery / coffee shop there"
The snow capped mountains make a spectacular back drop to the lovely Lake Maligne. We went on a boat tour on the lake with Luis and Josh. It was great to have facts and figures and learn heaps about the lake and the area. We stopped at a little island for photos and views. Very scenic.
"We rented canoes for 3 hours, paddled way down the lake, pulled over and ate a lunch on a pebble beach. We read books in the shade. We waded in the cold water. After returning our canoes we took the boat tour to Spirit Island. It was a very expensive day. ;-) All that said it was also one of the most relaxing days of our 2 week vacation to BC/AB. I would go back here again in a heartbeat."
"We stayed in Jasper and went on a day tour to Lake Maligne and Maligne Canyon, The scenery is beyond description. We went on a boat trip to Spirit Island. If you are within 50 (no, 100) miles of this attraction it is simply not to be missed"
The lake is beautiful and we drive along it -- but the view when you first come around the corner is magnificent. The parking lot is small and the flood of tourists endless but we still had a wonderful picnic there.
"Had a fantastic experience at Maligne Lake. The boat cruise was great, Kat and Andie were very professional and knowledgable. I would definitley go again!"
"This lake is very beautiful! It seems wild and uncontaminated. We start from here an hike to the not far away Moose lake where, as for the name, we saw a fantastic moose inside the lake. Unforgettable!"
"Had read a lot about this place before embarking on my Canada trip, it lived up to my expectations - scenery was just over the top. Love the mountains - we don't have such in Australia, ours are more like hills.Unfortunately the weather wasn't the best on the day of our visit but it didn't stop us from enjoying the attractions on offer - the cruise to Spirit Island, two walks and the cafeteria for a warm drink.On checking my photos on my return home I realized even more how beautiful this place was."
they have kayak/canoe rentals and dont let you bring your own. Probably due to the invasive mussel issue. There was a fire in the area so the sky was smokey and the lake took on the color so it wasnt as awesome looking as it probably actually is. Very crowded but everyone was having a good time. The park service had set up some easy ups with some educational items and some t shirts etc for sale. Nice.
On this day we were lucky to have a clear blue sky and sunny day.The lake was absolutely beautiful and serene. We decided to hire a row boat the price was a bit steep at approx $100 as they charge per person it was my husband and I.But it was well worth it the water was so blue the hour long ride was just enough for us. You had to wear life jackets and they gave us some safety instructions and helped us into and out of the boat.
We have a house right beside Lake Taupo in New Zealand and thought that seeing another lake after seeing so many on the Icefields Parkway that there would be no point in seeing yet another lakeWe were wrongAbsolutely wrongThis is a long narrow lake surrounded by high mountain peaks that is like nothing we had ever seen beforeWe were very sad that we could only stay a short time and will come back next year to take the boat ride to the end of the lake and explore the little island thereSpectacularAwesomeNot to be missed
We arrived excited as we'd just seen a black bear on the way up to the lack. We'd seen a number of spectacular lakes so were getting used to the wow factor. However Maligne lake was utterly breathtaking. We did a walk to Moose lake first which was lovely then took the cruise out to Spirit island. BOOK before you go!! The cruise was wonderful and the views out of this world. Go.
"This lake is simply beautiful. There is a decent restaurant and terrace for refreshments, but the real attraction is the shoreline. You can take your own canoes, fish, walk or just sit and enjoy to peace and beautiful surroundings. Sadly, many tour buses seem to disgorge visitors directly onto boat trips on the lake but you really don't need to take a boat trip to get the most out of this area. Just walk along the shoreline and you'll return feeling blessed."
"We parked near the restrooms and carried our kayaks down a little path to the beach / dock area. We put in around 9am and paddled for four hours. The water was so clear and blue that it was fun to look down to the bottom. The scenery was amazing and we wish we could have paddled farther! About noon the wind picked up and we had a good headwind getting back to the dock, so we were glad we hadn't gone too much farther."
We were lucky enough to have Maria and Malita as our crew. They were knowledgeand their personalities made the time fun. They had good knowledge of the lake and the area. Don't forget to ask them to tell you the story about the time they almost had to shut down.
"The Maligne Lake cruise is excellent! There are several cruise options - classic, premium, or photography. While I've been on the classic cruise several times, I just recently did the premium cruise. It's a slightly longer cruise with more time at Spirit Island. Also, my favourite part is the extra time in the bay near Spirit Island where you're surrounded by mountains. Sarah was our captain and Francoise was our guide on this trip. They were both great."
"We were kind of disappointed about lake Louise. Plus smoky sky caused by wide fire . But this place is crown jewel. Stockpile is fun, blue lake, glacier and forest far away, created a perfect photo opportunity.We went there before 8:30am, parking lot was full. You have to drive around or Ind a place that's on the side of road. If you don't want this, come after 2pm, wait for 5 minutes, you should be able to find one."
"Maligne Lake is certainly a place to visit. What a beautiful and calming scene! As with other lakes in the area, a jaw dropping view! Take the cruise boat!"
"The boat ride on Maligne Lake was OTT.
It is glacier formed with water from snow melt and glacier run off.
Blue green water surrounded be the Rocky Mountains.
The tree covered mountains with snow tops just rise out of the water."
At approx $90.00 for a motor coach and boat tour combined. Lasting approx five hours this is a but overpriced. Specifically because the views offered by the boat tour portion can pretty much be duplicated on the road for a large percentage if the tour. Price range of between 35/55.00 would be more in line because of this
"This lake is beautiful. Boat tours must be booked well in advance, not the day of when arriving. Hiking trails around the lake are a must. lots of wildlife."
Maligne lake is just another jewel of Jasper National park. So peaceful and just a grest place to visit
"This is just a stunning slice of heaven. We were gifted with a clear and crisp morning. The visibility was awesome. We were able to view the surrounding glaciers and take in the spectacular vistas. I would highly recommend you take the drive out here from Jasper. It takes just over an hour to drive here. Give yourself plenty of time to take in the equally stunning views of the drive. Parking is well signposted as you approach the lake. And there are a number of stunning walks, cruises, kayak and row boat activities on offer."
"Great for a walk along the shore, picnic, photography or just sitting back and enjoying the view. Thete is a cafevwith views backnoverbthe lake. There is also a ferry cruise which seems to be very popular."
"This is a picturesque lake that is worth the one hour drive from Jasper even if you don't take the cruise. There is a nice restaurant on site and you can take a nice stroll around and absorb the views. The area does get busier, so please plan accordingly!That said, the highlight of the lake is the wonderful boat cruise that you can take through Brewster. I reviewed that separately in a review specific to the tour operator. You may want to consider taking the cruise if you've already come this far. The basic stops at Spirit Lake about 10 minutes, the premium for half an hour (recommended) and the photo tour for much longer. It may be a bit pricey, but especially during a nice day you can see the beauty and marvel that is Spirit Lake (only accessible by the tour).Please kindly indicate if you found this review to be helpful as it will allow me to better focus my future efforts! Much appreciated - hope you have a great time and safe travels!"
"Thoroughly enjoyed the 90 minute round trip boat tour to Spirit Island. The boats are a good size for a small group and they keep the crowds to a minimum to be able to really enjoy the time walking around at Spirit Island. A nice, relaxing tour. Our tour guides Laura & Michelle did a great job. Nice to place spend a day in Jasper which is much less crowded than Banff."
"We were very pleased to experience Maligne Lake albeit it was getting cloudy and rained a bit. We took a good hike along the lakeshore and missed seeing a moose by five minutes! We even stopped by the boathouse to see the old canoes there. The scenery is amazing and I am sure during a blue sky day, a most magnificent view."
"Visited here with friends whilst holidaying in Canada from Australia. It was stunning. The ferry ride was brilliant to spirit island. The views are awesome. Our trip here was memorable
Will never forget this wonderful experience. Would go again in a heart beat."
"This lake is well worth a visit and we were told if you travel there early in the morning or at dusk you would see a bear, unfortunately we did not but the boat cruise guide said she sees one nearly every day. Make sure you book the boat cruise a week ahead, it gets very booked up and is limited."
"Beautiful lake that is best visited during summer months, as it totally freezes over during winter. Take the offered boat cruise, but check in advance because some days are sold out. When the cruise stops near Spirit Lake there are public restrooms."
"this was one of those places I could have just stayed at, the beauty of the surroundings combined with the peace it gave you were breathtaking. any one who has a chance to go , I say unequivocally GO."
"It's a little busy but there is lot's to see and do at Maligne Lake. Lot's of spots to picnic, lot's of hikes, a boat tour (a tad pricey though), gift shop or just sit by the shore. Worth the drive out!"
We visited maligne lake on our overnight stay in jasper while doing a road trip across Alberta and BC. Absolutely breathtaking scenery and you are sure to spot some wildlife on the road out to the lake (we saw 3 bears and some deer).We did not have tons of time so decided to do the boat tour so that we could go out to spirit island which is truly a highlight. The boat ride was nice and we learned lots about the area from the guide.If you have time (and the energy!) to kayak out then I think it would be worthwhile to better appreciate the scenery along the way. Best to plan for a whole day there if possible - you could kayak the lake or hike over to moose lake and there are various picnic areas to byo lunch.
Ample parking at the sight. We took a cruise of one and a half hours on the lake with explanations by a very nice young man. The organization was excellent.
Our captains were Maria and Savannah. They took us on what's called a premium tour. It was not much mor expensive than the regular tour. This tour was 2 hours instead of 1.5 hours. We got to spend some extra time at Spirit Island where Vicki did a wonderful job of giving us a comprehensive history of the Spirit Island. The scenery as well was awesome throughout the trip. If you are in Jasper don't miss this tour. You will not be sorry.
"Although you will visit here for the Lake there are lots of other things to do as well, boats & walking (main things in the parks). We didn't take a boat trip but walked part of the way around one of the many paths next to the lake, if you just want a short walk or a 10 klm hike there are lots of options.Outside of the restaurant (hot no air conditioning & expensive) there are lots of seats, we quite enjoyed sitting watching people out in the canoes rented from the lakeside"
"Absolutely beautiful. We took an upgraded boat tour to Spirit Island and it was magnificent. Actually, it was the best part of visiting the lake. If you don't take a tour you will miss the best scenery the area has to offer. On a side note, if you rent a canoe, please stay close to shore. My husband had to help rescue a couple from the frigid water when their canoe started taking on water from winds."
"we walked the Moose Lake Loop, which seemed far from any lakes, and the path was riddled with roots, so you could hardly take your eyes off the path to look around. it was a LOONG drive from Jasper for a mediocre walk. Medicine Lake was interesting to stop at on the way."
This was a nice surprise for its beauty and special environment created by the lake and the shore line walk. There is also a very rustic lodge there that is a great place for breakfast. There is nothing like the lodge in this area. It is not a special trip if you plan it into your days plan for the area.
"The drive to Maligne lake from Jasper is lovely. We saw a bear, caribou and mountain goats. We drove there at 10 am. I am glad we did as it was relatively quiet but on our way back there were so many cars and people headed our way. Go early if you go. The lake is beautiful. We tried a few days in advance to get tickets to see Spirit Island and they were sold out. We went to the ticket counter and we would have had to wait 3 hours for a tour that lasted 2 1/2 hours. We were so disappointed. Unless we were willing to go separately which we weren't. We were so disappointed. Instead we did a 3.2 km hike. It was called Mary Schaffer hike. It's an easy hike that is a loop and part of it runs along the lake. I recommend the hike. Bring your bug spray as you will be in the woods. Lovely area. Nice views. And there is a visitor center with food service and souvenir shop."
I visited maligne lake boat house a few days ago and rented a kayak. Having only been on the kayak for a few minutes my GoPro unfortunately slipped into the water and when I leaned over to grab it the kayak capsized and I ended up in the water. The staff were straight out to help me get back to shore and when they heard I had lost my GoPro they went out themselves to look for it. They took time out of their jobs to help me look for my GoPro. After a few hours I was sitting down by the lake when I saw them going out again and one of the girls got into the lake and managed to find my camera. She and the others were so kind and I could not recommend the boathouse anymore. It made my trip to Canada extra special.
"So we went a few weeks too early, unfortunately the majority of the Lake was still heavily frozen over. But! We saw 3 bears on the drive to Maligne Lake on the side of the road as well as heaps of other wildlife (go earlier in the morning if you want a higher chance of seeing wildlife) We got out and started walking around on the frozen lake, we noticed lots of bear prints in the snow as well as black fur, so that was really exciting as you could imagine, but also a little scary lol. It started to snow too and it truly was very very beautiful! Highly recommend checking it out or at least doing the hour long drive to :)"
Beautiful Lake with Greenish-Blue water! Lake cruise is available for either classic 1.5 hours or premium 2 hours. If you are interested in photos go for premium as the cruise boat stops 2-3 times in the middle of the lake for 360 degree viewing and also stops extra 30+ minutes at Spirit Island for photo opportunity. Our captain Andy and guide Melissa and Tim at Spirit Island were very knowledgeable and helpful. Melissa informed us about the history/ information of the lake and mountains for the whole ride ! Go for online booking as you will get discount and if available as a package with other attractions go for it!
Took a tour with Sundogs. Well worth it. Jason was a great guide with lots of info on the area and stories. Take the boat to Spirit Island. Went to Malign Canyon as well.
"Today we took our kayaks and set off to explore Maligne Lake in Jasper National Park. The lake is roughly 45 kilometers from the town of Jasper and is 22 kms long. We launched our kayaks at the public boat launch and headed off down the lake. We were warned that the wind would be at our back heading down the lake and then in our face heading back. However, mountain weather is very unpredictable so we were lucky to have the wind at our back on the way down and back. The scenery on the lake was spectacular. The fishing was also good. My husband caught a 1.5-2lb rainbow trout (you get a fishing license at the Tourist Info Centre for $10/day or $35 for a year). There are lots of things to see on the lake and there are many places to land your kayak if you want to have a picnic lunch. There are also places to camp on the lake but you have to make reservations in advance. All in all it was a great day and I would highly recommend this activity."
When we arrived it was cloudy. The lack of sun significantly impacted color of the lake. Many picnic tables along the lake making scenic lunch spot. The rentals were busy and first come first serve. You will need to sit tight and wait for a boat so have a plan B if you cannot wait. Look for the bald eagle nests along Medicine Lake on your way.
"All the lakes in the area are beautiful. Maligne was one of my favorites. The water is the most clear, unusual shade of turquoise I've ever seen. Took great photos. There are good hikes of varied distances and a great lunch picnic spot. Also, canoe rentals."
"Maligne Lake doesn't have the absolute best views. The drive there offers stunning sightseeing and wildlife-viewing opportunities. We were there in June of 2017. Boat rental there was $50 an hour for a 4-person rowboat, which was MUCH cheaper than boat rentals in some other famous alpine lakes in the Canadian Rockies (Lake Moraine, Lake Louise, and Emerald Lake in Yoho etc). And they didn't charge extra if you returned the boat a bit late."
"It takes about an hour to drive to Maligne Lake from Jasper but we saw sheep and other wildlife on the way. You drive by Medicine Lake on the way (interesting in that there is an underground drain to the lake) with pretty photo ops. Maligne Lake is pretty and if you have time, take the boat trip out to Spirit Island. Pretty views at sunset."
This is incredibly pretty. It's not even related to maligne which means evil. We're lucky to start our trip from maligne lake and Jasper which are not so crowded compared to Banff and Lake Louise.
"If you are going this area, this spot is a must see.
The boat ride is over priced in my opinion, but there are few different hiking courses and the lake is breathtaking."
Six of us took the cruise on Maligne Lake and really enjoyed it. The scenery is breathtaking. It is nice to walk around the island that they take you too. We booked it as a package with the Columbia Glacier walk and Banff Gondola and it was well worth it.
On the drive to the lake we spotted a bear strolling along the side of the road. This was followed by a 90 minute cruise to Spirit Island. Captain Kate and Laura were excellent. Highly recommended.
"This visit was part of a Brewster tour. We added the boat trip out to Spirit Island and were glad we did it. The day we were there, it was very cold and raining so we did not explore the area around the restaurant as much as we might have in better weather. The boat was enclosed so that was OK despite the weather. We walked around the island and did not get too wet. The lake is lovely and you can see the effect of the glacier melting in the variations of the water color."
"On the way drive there, we saw black bear. And we saw deer at lake. The lake is big and a lot people hiking, boating... It is so nice there."
"What a great place. You can do great hikes and a 90 min boat cruise is available too. I strongly recommend to prebook this, as it is very busy"
Maligne lake and in particular Medicine lake are wonderful wildlife areas. We had a fantastic meeting with a black bear at Medicine lake rest area! I ate breakfast when the bear arrive at the rest area (he might smelled my breakfast?) maybe he wanted breakfast as well? A woman shouted go into the cars there is a bear around the corner! I did go into the car but every one else went for their mobile phones and surf-plates and walked away from their cars. I fought maybe the bear are about 100 meter away? I took my camera and attached a 300 mm lens! I left the car and found the bear around the corner about 30 meters away. Many people there as close as ten meters but the bear was complete calm eating green grass. After awhile the bear moved down to the lake beach for some water and a swim!At the lake a person had his camera on a tripod planning a picture of the lake. He was completly unaware about the approaching bear. Some one shouted you have a bear behind your back! The bear was less than ten meters from the man! The man was scared but reacted very calmly in a most dangerous situation. The bear was very close and the man was alone. The man took his camera and tripod and walked slowly in the opposite direction of the bear! The bear continued to the water for a swim and to drink some water! After awhile the bear went up to a rock and dug up a kill probably a mountain sheep! He started to eat the mountain sheep. It is possible for wildlife viewing even at a rest area in Jasper national park. As a group human beings are very strong when meeting a bear but if you are alone the situation can be very dangerous! It depends on you how you behave in a encounter with a bear at close range.You can meet and see animal every there in Jasper national park are you prepared to meet them even at rest areas?
This lake rivals Lake Louise in beauty with the additional plus of limited tourists as there is no major hotel nearby. Take your time and enjoy. We saw bears so be careful and sensible.
The lake is approx. 1.5 hr from Jasper town and one may be able to catch some wildlife along the drive down Malign Lake Road in the early morning or evening. We saw a black bear and a deer.The lake is really quaint and beautiful and there are short and long hiking trails around the lake too. One can also take the 1.5 hr boat cruise from here. Tickets are sold onsite.
While I don't recall the lake being one of the better ones in the alberta area it was definitely a trip well worth it. The road out to the lake we spotted the most black bears and elk we had seen the whole trip. Worth the drive!
"Stunning scenery, great to be able to get off the boat and take pictures of spirit island, Sarah and (apologies for forgetting the other young lady's name but she was from New Zealand) the other guide were extremely knowledgeable and helpfulThe colour of the water is stunning, the scenery breathtaking- the only reason I haven't given it 5 stars is that it's quite a costly boat trip, but at least it's 1.5 hour trip"
I loved Maligne lake. After seeing many beautiful lakes in the Canadian Rockies I have to say this one is the BEST ! Yes it evens beats Lake Louise .....
"This lake is close to Jasper city, the road to this lake is about 2km before the exit to Jasper (when coming from Edmonton). It's a beautiful lake, where you can rent boats and fish. There is a restaurant by the shore and a gift shop. If you pass the parking lot entrance, you can stop and see the lake from a little bridge, where you can take nice photos. It's nice to stop by Medicine Lake on the way to the lake and Maligne Canyon on the way back to Jasper. We visited in late May and there was still some ice covering the lake."
"This was one of our favorite places to visit while staying in Jasper. What a breathtakingly gorgeous setting! We took the boat (expertly piloted by Michelle and narrated by Maria) to Spirit Island. The beauty of the place is indescribable. Turquoise waters, fantastic colorful,bluffs and rock formations....just wow. Definitely worth the stop."
This is a beautiful area where you can do walks along the water's edge as well as through the forest. You can hire canoes and kayaks and I highly recommend the boat cruise that goes up to Spirit Island. Wonderful scenery and photo opportunities. I loved standing out the back but bring a jacket as it can be cold.
"It has been about 40 years since I was here, it is a beautiful spot, and the drive up from Jasper is such a pleasure.I should return and spend a couple of days camping.Stop at the tourist info area at Medicine Lake song the way, very cool."
Wel worth a trip and spend some time walking. Beautiful scenery wild flowers. I would have liked to have stayed a while longer
"Loved the drive up, so beautiful. Lots of life to see, including bears and eagles, and silly people getting far to close to the wildlife. The trail was very good, well marked. We were surprised by the lack of people on the trail, compared to how many cars were in the parking lot. Looking forward to going back."
"Visited close to end May, with a heavy snowfall the day before. There's still snow on the ground all around the area. The lake was thawing. It was really beautiful. We didn't go for the lake cruise, which we believe wasn't operating that day. We saw a bear on the road nearer to medicine lake, and the journey up here was just as scenic too. It's not too far from jasper town, so you can easily make this a half day out."
Maligne lake is huge and just gorgeous! we visited on a windy but sunny day & took boat tour (can also rent canoe/kayaks). the tour was excellent. plenty of trails around main marina as well to explore.
The lake is renown. Spirit island adorns many a calendars. I once traveled here with a Russian who just had to see it because he had seen it in photographs. The day we visited it rained and that was not an issue as there was lots of room in the visitor lodge and shops. There are lots of room in the cafeteria and the food was quite reasonable and well priced. This is a popular spot with tour buses so crowds could be an issue at time. Visitor levels were not bad the day we were there.
We drove the 45 minute drive from Jasper to Maligne Lake. So worth getting there. Saw a couple bears along the way. It was a rainy day but the boats are completely enclosed so never got wet. Our captain Luis and guide Sara were super friendly and informative. Such a beautiful lake and surrounding mountains. Highly recommend seeing the lake by boat.
"Nature at it's best. Beautiful lake, serene surroundings. Enough of car parking space. We took the boat cruise to Spirit Island which is one of the most photographed places in the world! The place is amazing.No public transportation available. We did the day tour with Brewster and enjoyed it."
This lake is absolutely exquisite. We had an amazing time in Jasper. I would highly recommend seeing this lake and the canyon
Mother nature at her best. The natural Beauty is simply breathtaking and then add to that the story of how the lake was formed - WOW. Of course there is a gift shop and rest rooms.
"We drove to Maligne Lake from Jasper, and totally loved the drive, searching for wildlife the entire way. Be sure and stop at Medicine Lake for great photo opportunities. There was lots of parking (for cars and campers) at Maligne Lake. A short walk through a path brings you to some stunning views. You can rent canoes or kayaks, and enjoy the lake. Or take the cruise, which we did, and I'll cover in another review. Or go for a walk along the shore, which many people did. We picked up lunch at the deli on-site, and enjoyed it outside on the multi level patio. There was still snow on the patio and along the paths, from some winter like conditions two days earlier. There are also two gift shops on-site. The lake and the mountains surrounding it are beautiful. It's a great way to spend some time in nature."
Great 90 minutes trip on Maligne Lake by boat. Lots of information given by friendly guide and captain. The walk of 10-15 minutes on land was great. Beautiful pictures taken. Also from the famous Spirit Island. One minor detail: price is rather high (75 Can$ per person).
So happy we chose to do the boat cruise with Lisa and Scott! Scott's commentary was very informative and the scenery spectacular.....
"My partner and I hiked a short distance to a beautiful lake called Mona where we saw migrating ducks diving in and out of the water. Definitely worth a visit, some interesting history there too"
We visited here in late May and the lake was still frozen over. It is a pleasant place and very quiet but visiting in summer would be much better.
"We weren't in much of a hiking mood when we got here. But the drive was fantastic and the walk around the lake was wonderful. We were there just as the ice was breaking, bet it is very pretty in the summer"
The drive down to the lake is really scenic. Once at the lake you'll find several trails. Nothing too strenuous. We were escorted on a trail by 3 Gray Jays. There are also a Moose couple near the main lodge - they are really really tame.
The lake is still mostly frozen over. Drive over the bridge and you can see a lot of fish under the bridge. An enjoyable drive in nature. We didn't see any animals.
The drive up to the lake is ALMOST as beautiful as the lake itself. We saw 6-7 bears which made the whole trip! I am looking forward to returning when the lake is thawed!
"Well worth the drive up. With a colder, snowy start to the spring the lake was still mostly frozen and snow covered. If you're prepared you can still tour and hike around. Can't wait to go back in the summer to see the water and do a boat tour."
"We went to the lake and it was totally frozen and snowed on- it still looked beautiful and was well worth the drive! Pretty sure I saw a moose in the woods but equally it could have been a giant mossy rock with ill placed branches on either side...in my mind I saw the wildlife! The drive could maybe have a halfway sign, we were worried we got lost at one point but don't five up! It is practically impossible to get lost on one long road and the lake is well worth it."
"The lake is famous for taking photos of deep blue hues of the lake, the surrounding peaks, and the three glaciers visible from the shoreline and Spirt Island"
"Lost our car keys in snow, but staff there were amazing helping us to try find keys. Total gentlemen"
The scenery was so majestic. We took the boat cruise to Spirit Island which was fabulous. The girl guide who happened to be from Ontario where we're from was very informative. The only thing was lack of Sun shine that day.
"Most beautiful view from the boathouse, the cruise to Spirit Island itself is an unique experience and the view from there is just breathtaking.The drive between the lake and the town of Jasper is fun with lots of bear sightings. Stay safe and indoors! Bears are pretty but can be dangerous."
"Not to be missed. The largest glacier fed lake in the Canadian Rockies, turquoise blue and surrounded by dramatic mountain peaks. Breathtaking views. The lake is home to tiny Spirit Island, one of the most photographed natural features in Canada. An unexpected bonus is the serenity of the spectacular setting, with so few other boats, kayaks, canoes...and other people.Boat cruises are available from the Maligne Lake Day Lodge, which also has a restaurant and gift shop. We highly recommend the lake cruise. The location is an easy drive from the town of Jasper. See Maligne Canyon on the way."
Allow enough time to take the boat trip on this beautiful lake over to Spirit Island. The guides are very informative and it is a lovely way to get in touch with nature and the majesty of the mountains.Thank heavens these parks are still only lightly touched by the hands of man.
"There is a boat that you can book to go on, which takes about 45 minutes to get to where the boat stops to let you out for about 10 minutes. There is plenty of photo opportunities with the mountains in the background and of Maligne Lake itself. Its a great place to visit after the lake has thawed out at the end of Spring."
"The drive is a bit long, allow for extra time to drive up as you may want to stop for wildlife viewing along the way (bears). Well worth the drive, nice scenery. We took the boat cruise down the lake, to Spirit Island. The views are fantastic, beautiful lake nestled in the mountains. The cruise is a bit expensive but interesting; we got to see the whole lake and we got lots of explanations and comments from the guide. The boat stopped for a bit, and we walked along the trails next to Spirit Island. Beautiful place in the Rockies!"
"I went during the winter. The view was not that good since I went during a blizzard. But while you walk, you can choose from different routes going all around the lake! Very good place to enjoy the day or maybe half a day of exercise."
"The drive from Jasper was a bit long, but this was another beautiful spot in Canada. The lake itself is gorgeous, and there is some wildlife like geese, ducks, chipmunks, and certain birds that makes it even more interesting. I recommend taking the short hike off of this lake to the Moose Lake (I think that's the name). Totally different landscape on this lake vs. Malign, but beyond amazing. Reminded me of a Monet painting. This is a very popular and busy lake, but it's worth the trip to walk to the other side (from the gift shop) as the crowd thins out quickly. We didn't take the boat tour, so I can't comment on that."
"Maligne Lake is accessed by a relatively scenic road but it is an ""in and out"" drive. It is worth it. Allow time to walk along the shore."
"Its a Superb place to visit..
The Cruise is Great, driven usually by Lady.
Great...
I would love to visit again."
"Don't miss a visit to the Maligne Lake.The drive is worth every second. You are going to stop a few times on your way to the lake to take some photos.When you arrive, you will not believe your eyes, so beautiful mountains and forest surround the lake. The water is cold, but my 20 something son and son-in-law went for a swim in it. Oh, and the dog loved it.On our way back to the car there was a double rainbow, what a great place for good shots.We would like to go back again an other time, and I usually don't go back twice to the same place."
"We drove to this place by ourselves, ride the boat to spirit island. Very beautiful lake. Nice restaurant, a lot of choices for the food, but a bit pricy. Easy access for all ages.A must stop in Jasper National Park. I used 12 mm lens for most my photos."
"Great place to go with family or friends. You can have a picnic on the lake - there is an area with picnic tables. Great view of the lake and the mountains. There is shop, place to eat and attractions in the area. You can spend a day having fun."
"It is an hours drive and about 30 miles from Jasper to the lodge, restaurant (great coffee!), gift shop and boat docks at Maligne Lake (pronounced Maleen). The deep blue, 14 mile long lake surrounded by picturesque snow capped mountains is the largest in Jasper National Park. Canoe rentals and a 90 minute boat cruise to famous Spirit Island (recommended, advance reservations required) are available. There are several hikes starting at the lake. The easiest is the 1.6 mile Moose Lake Loop starting at the lot at the end of the road. The Mary Schafer Loop, 2 miles, starts at the first parking on the right. There is a more moderate 3.1 mile circuit hike to Lorraine and Mona Lakes. More difficult are the 4.9 mile Opal Hills and 6.2 mile Bald Hills circuit hikes.There are good views of Medicine Lake and the mountains along the drive. Driving back we got some good photos of a female moose walking along side of the road. Did this review earn a helpful vote?"
"The view of the lake itself from the shore is beautiful, but if this is all that you see of the lake, then it's probably worth 3.5 stars in comparison with other beautiful lakes in the Rockies.You get a more candid view of the lake and its surrounding glaciers by taking a boat cruise to see the spiritual island. It is somewhat pricey for the 15 minutes that you're allowed on-land where the ""creme de la creme"" of the view is, but the view of the spiritual island at the landed spot was truly out of this world! (5 star)However, I really wish we could spend 30 minutes there, so a star was taken off for that.We saw a swimming black bear on the return trip of the cruise. (how many stars should I give???)"
Maligne lake was one of my favourite places I visited on my trip. We were lucky we had such a beautiful day to enjoy the incredible scenery. We were not going to take the boat trip but decided last minute we would. My boyfriend and I don't really like going on tourist trips although this boat trip was pretty good. The boat took us to spirit lake past beautiful mountains taking its time so we could take in the scenery.
"great hikes, boat tours and remote beauty is what you get at Maligne Lake. There is a little harbor from where the boat trips go, but other than that it's very quiet. Only boats with an electric motor are allowed on the lake. There are long (several days) and shore (1 hour round trip) hikes, and they are beautiful. The surrounding mountains are ofthe snow capped, to add to the spectacular scenery."
It's quite a long drive down to the lake but the road is excellent and there's plenty to see on the way. Main attraction (apart from the sight of the lake itself) is to take a cruise on the lake and that's well worth the time and the money
Another vast lake with views and wildlife to see. Plenty of walks and the opportunity fo a lake boat cruise available
We took the cruise to Spirit Island. This is the most beautiful place I have ever visited. Well worth the time to visit this lake. The boat trip was well worth the price with an exceptional crew. Terrific spot for all ages.
Worth a trip for sure. Lovely location and nice to visit at any time of years. I would highly recommend a visit.
"Try also to walk near Moose Lake, that's nearby and many opportunities to see the moose. This area is very nice to make walks arounds the lakes."
"Coming from Jasper we passed Medicine Lake, first impression whahaaaaw but after that we ended in Maligne. Stunning views quite and peacefull, wonderfull views. Even if it takes some money, you should definitely go for that boat trip. Students guide you through the landscape with nice and funny stories."
"This lake was the main destination of our coach tour from Jasper. It covers a very large area and is surrounded by mountains providing excellent scenic views. There are boat trips on the lake, which we also took. This emphasised the size of the lake. Other water borne activities are kayaking. There is a good parking area, a cafe/ restaurant and washrooms. A short walk from the restaurant is a display showing the first visitors to the area, who were responsible for early tourist developments. These have now progressed to the current facilities that thankfully do not detract from the beauty of the area. Another lake and area worth including in your itinerary.."
We arrived in the lake mid morning and spotted a couple of moose grazing by the boat shed. The lake is in a spectacular setting with snow capped mountains in the background There are a number of easy trails you can do around and by the lake. Make sure you walk to the viewpoint girl a great photo if the lake and mountains This is the Jasper highlight
"Just spending some time at this beautiful lake, ringed by glacial mountains, is a relaxing thing to do. We took our time wandering around the shoreline, taking photographs. There is a nice gift shop and cafe with good coffee (free refills) and baked goods, if you're looking for a snack. The Mary Schaeffer Loop is pleasant, if you have the time. From the boathouse at Maligne Lake, this easy trail along the lake loops back to the parking lot. We only went to the lookout, which basically offers the same view as the cruise (if you've taken the Maligne Lake Cruise). We were not sure how far it was from the lookout to the parking lot, so instead we turned around and re-traced our steps. This trail offers a pleasant, easy walk along the lake. I would probably recommend it if you do not pay the price for the cruise; however, if you've done the cruise and you are tired or if you are short on time, it is definitely skippable."
Enchanting lake in the Canadian Rockies. The tranquility of this lake is mesmerizing as is the colour of its waters.
It was a nice drive to see the area on the way to the lake. the walk around the area was ok. would I go back - perhaps not
"How beautiful was this lake! It was a great outing, even if you are not a great hiker, which I'm not. but so worth it."
"While we were staying at the Miette Hot Springs Bungalows we decided to take a drive to Maligne lake and wow! What a stunning drive!!There is some cool history here with trails everywhere and a gift shop (which was closed for the season, Oct 3rd)There are bus tours and boat tours which would be delightful.This lake is so crystal clear you can see all that exists on the floor."
"The drive from Jasper to the lake is really beautiful and takes 45 mins to an hour. We thought the boat trip was a bit pricey but it was worth it! Stunning views out to Spirit Island and our compare on the boat was friendly and informative. You have plenty time to get out at Spirit Island and walk to the lookout point. We decided to go to the lake again very early the next day in the hope we would see some wildlife on the road. We didn't but when we got to the lake car park we saw mule deer and ...... Wait for it ..... A bull moose calf and his mother!!!! They swam across the lake to the far side. It was exceptional and one of the highlights of our 3 week trip. Then, on the way back, we saw another two moose! This is very, very unusual apparently but we had photographic evidence to prove it."
"We were fortunate to have a sunny day which brought out the lovely colour of the water. Our boat was manned by two women, one the pilot and the other a guide. The guide gave us an excellent and informative (and humorous) commentary despite her young years. The scenery was good on the way to spirit island (a headland), but on arrival the view became stunning. The composition of the mountains, water, trees were simply wonderful and competes with the best in The Rockies. No wildlife seen. A must for photographs. Had a lovely picnic by waterside. There is a restaurant here."
Take the maligne lake cruise to get to one of the best views and try canoeing or kayaking if you are interested.
It's well worth the trip out to Maligne Lake. The colour of the water is stunning and the mountains surrounding it only add to the beauty.
"If you know enough about it to be looking up the reviews, you'll have realised this is one you shouldn't miss. You can do it as a Box Tick, in 15 mins if you want, but you will miss the real beauty and majesty of the lake/mountains. Unless you've seen enough mountains on the way up? The mini-cruise is worth doing, but do it as part of the Brewster Travel mega package including Icefields Parkway and Banff Gondola, otherwise it's a little pricey. Worth choosing over the other cruise on the options packages. Allocate at least 2-3 hours in your itinerary and enjoy it at leisure from the open back of a boat.The cafe serves the usual stuff, I do wish they wouldn't pre-sugar their hot chocolate!!Comment in the review about no tickets is just for the lake. You need tickets for the cruise."
It's got beautiful mountains all around it.....the lake is a glacier melt and the scenes are awesome all the way up and down the trip...it is a must see for people who are already in the Jasper park area...Moraine lake is closer to Jasper township...and this lake in particular has some amazing views...chances of catching a few elk or Cariboo makes this trip to the lake all the more worthwhile...it's a place we usually visit whenever we are in the area...
"Its a long drive to this lake, 58km, from Jasper and you have to return by the same route, but the journey is well worthwhile. This lake is incredibly beautiful, possibly because it is larger than many of the other lakes and therefore you can fully appreciate the whole panorama of the surrounding mountains. If you do visit the lake then take the boat tour as well because that is a great experience."
We went to Lake Minnewanka in Banff and Maligne in Jasper. Both are very similar and also both have cruise. I only know these tow lakes have cruise service. The Maligne is less crowded then Minnewanka.
"We drove to the lake and took a trek along the lakes eastern shore. Stopped at the restaurant and souvenir shop area, picnicking at the parking area. We did not take the lake boat tour. The views along the highway from Jaspers - especially the Disappearing lake (Medicine Lake) were amazing."
This exceeded all expectations of a lake tour. Spirit Island was beautiful! Gregg and Kelsey brought the lake and it's history to life. Could not have enjoyed it more!
Took the road from jasper to maligne lake as we'd read this was the place to spot bears and we weren't disappointed. We saw a brown bear then shortly afterwards saw a mummy bear with her cubs and they climbed a tree. All we needed was goldilocks! Lake was ok but paled compared to seeing the bears.
"The road into Maligne was an enjoyable drive, but we were a bit disappointed after everything we had heard about Maligne. It's got some great views, but it is not nearly as spectacular as other lakes we visited in Banff NP. It's also crowded, very crowded. It's still worth the ride in, so do take the time to visit. Would recommend going early in the day or late."
"Nice drive, always see assorted wildlife. The aspen are magnificnet currently. Snow on the mountians. Lovely boat ride to Spirit Lake....bring your jackets"
"We visited Maligne Lake in the last day of a 10 day trip to Banff and Jasper. We were all pretty tired, so almost skipped Maligne Lake. I am so glad that we went, because it was absolutely beautiful! There were snow covered mountains in the background which reflected on a crystal clear lake. Boating and kayaking was available, but we just walked around in awe of the scenery. Maligne Lake turned out to be the cherry on a fabulous cake of a trip."
"We hiked the Mary Schaffer loop which goes along part of the lake shore. The views were okay, but there are better lakes to see. This is good for a quick stop-off."
"I really enjoyed this. The drive up to the lake is very pretty, stopping at Maligne Canyon for a walk and Medicine Lake for a quick photo along the way. Once at the lake there are lots of activities and attractions that one can see and do (cruise, canoe hire etc). We just took a stroll along the flat lake shore whilst admiring the views. We also ran into a moose on the path, which was lovely to see. Highly recommended to all."
"Spirit Island would be the first catch when you searched Maligne Lake. Unfortunately, it only can be reached if you take the cruise which was quite expensive. $65 / adult and $33 / children. There are several hiking trails around. The lake itself is absolutely beautiful. A moderate driving time from Jasper, approx 1 hour one way, but it was worth it."
"Had a great cruise with 2 great ladies one the captain the other on commentary they made the cruise fun but also informative, being very knowledgeable about the area. They made a great teamWe got off at Spirit Island for a quick walk round before the ride back. Got some great pics from the back deck as the boat sped along. Great day"
"We went on the cruise to Spirit Island, a really beautiful ride there & return. We were lucky enough to see a deer swimming across the lake."
"We stopped in to see Maligne Falls, and the sheer beauty of it was amazing.We opted not to pay the $60 per person fee for the boat trip, but I do think it would be worth it as the Lake continues right into the heart of the Mountains.A great spot for everyone"
"We had an amazing boat ride and great crew members that informed us of all we needed to know and the color od the glacier lake is out of this world cold but fantastic to just look at .
Its a must see :)"
We drove ourselves to the Lake from Jasper took 40 mins. Went very early arriving about 8am and the journey was very quiet. Spotted an Elk. Very few people there and it was great to walk the gentle Mary Scaffer loop of about 3.5km. We seemed to be alone on the trail as most people seem to stay at the expensive restaurant or take the boat trip. We opted out of the boat trip this time so can't comment on that. Scenery spectacular though.
The drive to the lake is absolutely fantastic with many stops for photos it took us 1.5 hours to drive to the lake. Plenty of walks for the more athletic and the lake is stunning when you get to it. Wish we had more time to spend in this location
"We got there at 8.30a.m. Staff were scraping the ice off the boats! There was an interesting shop to look round, and a place to get a drink. We boarded the boat, and were given lots of information by the guide. The island was beautiful, and not to be missed. The guide spoke to us all on the way back, which was nice. A place that you must visit."
"We were picked up from our hotel in Jasper by Sean, a very enthusiastic and knowledgeable young man. He drove us from Jasper to Maligne Canyon then Medicine Lake and on to Maligne Lake providing us with a wealth of information along the way.The scenery at the Lake is truly wonderful and the cruise worth taking. Again, a knowledgeable guide. Sean made the trip back to Jasper another educational and entertaining trip."
"Maligne Lake is absolutely beautiful!!! The surrounding mountains were snow capped and the lake water was crystal clear, which made for an amazing setting. Unfortunately, we didn't have a lot of time to spend at the Lake (didn't get to take the cruise to Spirit island), but we were able to drive around to the different parking areas and walk along the shorts paths by the lakeside. There were lots of people at the lake, even though it was a Wednesday, but not enough people to distract from the Lake. There are lots of spots for great photo opportunities. The drive to the lake was long (about 40-45 km) so make sure you allot plenty of time for the journey and some of the sections of road were very mountainous with lots of switchbacks and no shoulder, so be prepared for slower driving. Wonderful stop on our Jasper trip. Would have loved to spend more time at the Lake... maybe next time!!"
"Beautiful lake for a canoe trip! Normal rental price for a canoe, 40 CAD/hour (lake louise 85 CAD!! and moraine lake 50 CAD!) and they didn't charge us for an extra half an our. Safe for young kids. Excellent service!"
"The view from the boat going down Maligne Lake was great, those mountains and the colors of the lake.But once at the viewpoint near Spirit Island, it turned almost magic, the color of the water, the reflections and the surrounding mountains. As usual the camera could not catch this, mostly because the sun was on the mountains tops but not fully on the island, but this only added to the drama, with the shining white glaciers."
"First things first...we saw a moose here!! We drove from pyramid lake to maligne lake and the drive itself is stunning and would highly recommend! Get the maligne lake early and it is quiet and tranquil! There are multiple hikes of differing difficulty here, we did an easy 3 mile forest walk and then the 6 mile bald hills hike, this was stunning and the views immense- the latter part of the hike is very uphill so be prepared! This lake is a must and hopefully you will see a moose too...hooves crossed!"
"If you are in Jasper, don't miss a trip to Maligne Lake.The views are superb, and the lake offers the possibilities if hiking, canoeing and boat cruises.We were not savvy enough to have booked a cruise in advance, so we missed that. Advice: book at least a week ahead!The walking was good, and we got some great photos. We were also lucky with some wildlife sittings. Were they Deer or Caribou? We are not experts..."
"On the road out to the lake we spotted around 8 bears, moose elk, and a few other critters. That alone was worth the drive out to the lake. The restaurant and facilities at the lake are great. Yes there will be great big buses there but there space for everyone. There is a good walk around the edge of lake. The cruise to the other end is also good. You could make this either a half day or a full day trip out from Jasper."
"This lake is absolutely beautiful. We rented a canoe and booked 'Hidden Cove' campsite for one night. (I would suggest renting from University of Calgary as it is cheaper to rent there for a week vs. a day at Maligne lake). It took one hour to reach the campsite and the views are incredible. Surrounded by mountains and clear blue lake. The lake reflects the clouds and the pictures and views you can get are unreal. We set up our hammock and watched as others canoed and the tour boat go by. The lake is calm, just stay away from the tour boats, and its an easy paddle."
"This lake is nothing short of amazing. The beauty of it surrounded by the mountains it literally something of out a magazine. The lake also has a bunch of trails to other, smaller lakes and areas around it. You can also take a cruise to spirit island (didn't do it because of the wait), but I've heard that is incredible. You can easily spend an entire day here hiking around and seeing the lake from different views. You must stop here if you are anywhere close."
We enjoyed walking the trail along the lake. This was beautiful but then after visiting Lake Louise you can't help but compare. We did not do the boat ride but loved spending the time in the area.
"Not as spectacular as Morraine or Lake Louise, Maligne Lake is very pretty, more affordable canoe rentals ($40/hour) and feels less crowded. It's a lovely side trip and the cafeteria has a decent variety and large outdoor patio facing the lake. It looked like more than half of the people took the boat ride. I highly recommend. With an early start, you could got to Malign Lake, canoe and have lunch and then hike beautiful Maligne Canyon on your way pack to Jasper."
Maligne Lake is one of many nice lakes in the Jasper area but it is a bit out of the way. You pass by Medicine Lake too on the way there. Spirit Island was a bit overrated and you can't visit it. It's a nice scenic drive to the lake but otherwise a bit of a long drive there.
"The lake was incredible! Pack a lunch and eat out by the picnic tables surrounding the lake. Don't eat at the actual restaurant unless you want to experience bad, over priced food!"
"This lake is stunningly beautiful and nearly beyond description, particularly at the Spirit Island lookout where the boat tour goes. It's an iconic view that is among the most photographed in Canada. I would compare it to Moraine Lake in terms of its sublime beauty. Maligne Lake is more remote but worth the effort to get there. The story of how it was discovered and protected by Mary Schaffer and the Park system is inspiring."
"Beautiful,scenic area. Maligne Lake is so picturesque with these mountains as a backdrop. Stunning scenery."
"I have visited mountain scenery all over Europe and the US over the years, and I can honestly say I have never seen a more beautiful sight than Maligne Lake. On our visit to Jasper national park last week, this was always no. 1 on our must-do list, and it certainly did not disappoint !We parked up in the large parking lot, and walked around to the lake shore. The view that greets you just takes your breath away. The view from the boat launches straight down Maligne Lake to the range of snow covered mountains at the back is simply stunning. No photos can do this view justice. We were lucky to be there on a perfect sunny day with blue skies.We walked the Mary Shaeffer loop on our trip, which is well worth doing. It starts along the lake shore and exits at a spectacular view down the lake, where there are also some good information boards.A stunningly beautiful place to visit, and easily the best attraction in the amazing Jasper national park. It is much easier to park at than Lake Louise, is far more beautiful, and has about 100 times fewer visitors. Can't say more than that !!!"
Exceptionally beautiful scenery. Not to be missed in the Rockies. Much less busy then Lake Louise and more genuine. Take a tour on kayaks or canoes while you're there. There is a nice cabin restaurant too.
"While I realise that most people who visit Maligne Lake go as far as Spirit Island on the tour boats, there is another option that is not as expensive as using the canoes/kayaks available at the Maligne Boat House. Rent your canoe/kayak in Jasper and have a full day on the lake. Note - you need some experience in a canoe/kayak to do this. Wind,rain,sleet,snow all can come quickly over the mountains and will make your paddle challenging. A simple Google search of ""Jasper canoe rentals"" will give you options that are cheaper than renting at Maligne.It is 14km from the boat launch to Spirit Island then a further 8km to the south end at Coronet Creek. Plan on being on the water early (by 8am) and give yourself a minimum 3 hours to get to Spirit Island. If you are fortunate you will be able to have the viewpoint overlooking Spirit Island (and the washroom) to yourself (between tour boats) before you head further south down the lake leaving the tour boats behind. A 4 hour loop exploring the south end of the lake will get you back to Spirit Island and your 3ish hour paddle home.Parks Canada has a map that is useful for planning your day out. I've included it in the photos.A very brief hike to Teardrop Falls is a nice excuse to stretch your legs, and taking a break at Spindly Creek (picnic table and outhouse) will set you up for the trip back. The watchwords for the south end of the lake are solitude and breathtaking mountain vistas. You are literally paddling ""in the mountains"". Multi day trips are also possible using the campgrounds at Fisherman's Bay and Coronet Creek. Only 8 tent pads per site so book early through Parks Canada. Don't just turn up and hope to stay - Park Rangers patrol the lake and campsites. This trip is a FULL DAY OUT and has the potential to be physically demanding depending on the weather and headwinds. You need to pack accordingly and be prepared to get off the lake if required until weather conditions improve. 3 hours to Spirit Island, 4 hours on the south end of the lake and 3 hours from Spirit Island home make for a 10 hour day - add 2 more hours for the unexpected - that's a very long day out. Worth every blister on your hands and callous on your bum though!"
Wife wanted to see Maligne again so we took the drive. Stopped to read at several sights. At the lake interacted with the staff and lots of tourists. Had the three ferrets with us so everyone had questions. Made for a fantastic afternoon.
"This was the most beautiful lake I have ever seen (and I've seen a few) in a wonderful setting. The colours of the water are amazing - greens and blues - backed by the mountains. The trip to Spirit Island was magical and the captain of the boat (Laura) and her narrator (Luis from Venzuela) were in fact together as a couple and kept us entertained on the ride. They made a great team and really added to the trip. They were both so enthusiastic and considering they probably did this trip several times a day, it was a credit to both of them. Highly recommended."
We took the tour of Maligne Lake. This was our second visit and we really enjoyed the boat trip out to Spirit Island. Gorgeous views along the way of glaciers and wildlife. We enjoyed visiting with people from all over the world. The boats are comfortable and the guides were very personable. The scenery was simply breathtaking. Tickets can be purchased in Jasper or online. The staff at the Jasper office was very friendly.
"Magnificent lake. Worth a visit. We decided not to do a lake cruise, due to time restraints. Easy drive from Jasper"
"The drive from Jasper to Maligne Lake is amazing - yes it's scenic and the lake is beautiful, but it's the wildlife that's truly outstanding. We saw bears just a couple of miles in to the drive on the way there and on the way back. Definitely a memorable drive!"
You can swim in Lake Maligne and it is a very pleasant place to have a walk. We did not take the boat tour nor rented a boat that was pretty expensive but the walk on the left bank from the parking is very nice. Excellent landscapes
We rented a canoe and paddled the lake for two hours. We felt it was pretty costly but it was great to be on the water and the views were super. Make sure you leave more time for the return paddle as you will be tired. Especially if the wind is blowing in the direction that is away from the boathouse.
"A couple of years ago my husband and I took the boat to Spirit Island which was very scenic. The boat tour only allowed about 7-10 minutes at Spirit Island so we felt rushed to get the photos we wanted, but over all the tour was pleasant, enjoyable. This year we opted to do the Opal Hills hike which I highly recommend. Except for one other couple we had the trail to ourselves, then we met a couple of bull moose just off the trail. We kept our distance as they were sparring for territory. We had to bushwhack way off the trail to get around them and even then they watched us closely. The trail gives some great views way above the lake and goes above tree line at its highest point for a beautiful panorama of the mountains. There are no opals in the Opal Hills, the name comes from the many colored hillsides.The only negative I would give for the Maligne Lake area is for the cafeteria. Our sandwiches were stale and old, large parts of the lettuce were brown. I mentioned the sorry state of the sandwiches to the manager and he walked away making no comment."
It is about a 45km / 28mi drive to Maligne Lake with not much to see along the way. The lake itself is also not that spectular. You can make a pricey boat trip with a zillion other tourists. I would not recommend this but rather visit Patricia & Pyramid Lakes.
Brewster tours are once again very good at this tour. The staff were very knowledgeable and funny and kept us entertained the whole time.
Spent the morning on the lake cruising around. Great spot perfect views and plenty of wildlife with moose grazing in the shallows. Just a perfect place to visit.
"So the lake was fun and the views were nice. It was cloud we we went, so the views weren't the best. But the real reason for the low rating is the way Brewster does reservations. We bought the $150 combo pass. Since we started in Banff, we bought it there. We were able to book the Maligne Lake cruise until we arrived in Jasper. And assured it would not be a problem. It was. We arrived in Jasper on a Tuesday and the first open boat was on Friday. That's a problem if you are only staying 2 days. Luckily we shifted some things around and got to go. There is no reason you shouldn't be able to book a time from Banff."
"It is a beautiful drive from Jasper to Maligne Lake. One can see the mountains, forests, some animals, charred trees from the fire of last summer, Medicine Lake, and beautiful scenery. It is a very relaxing area to visit. One can rent boats to explore the lake as well as a boat cruise to Spirit Island and back."
"Managed to get tickets last minute and so did the cruise. Staff great and informative but I think once you haVe seen some of the other sights along the Rockies is is not as stunning, but we did it and ticked the box.The best part of the trip was seeing a black bear on route and it walked in front of our vehicle about 5 ft in front, so glad that we were heading for the cruise trip."
"After hiking the easy Moose Lake trail, we put our inflatable kayak into the water and spent a most enjoyable four hours kayaking around the lake. Boat rentals are available near the main lodge. The only downside to this lake are the noisy tour boats that speed along the lake creating large wakes and making it difficult for canoeists and kayakers."
I visited here for the day. We had a picnic breakfast overlooking the lake and then went on a 3km walk around some of the lake as well as seeing the amazing vegetation. Amazing views. Cruises are available as well as hiring canoes.
"This lake was the last lake during our week long trip. We prefer Moraine Lake and Bow lake. Maligne Lake is about 1 hour drive from Jasper. It was a little bit disappointing as there were lots of sight seeing boats on the lake, which affected the natural beauty."
"The road from Maligne Canyon to Maligne Lake (pronounced Muh-leen) is jaw-dropping! Worth every single solitary minute. We couldn't help but stop at so many spots and saw a black bear too! Once you get to the lake, it's just lovely. We didn't go to Spirit Island, but we hiked the Moose Lake Loop. Unfortunately, my elusive moose stayed hidden. But there was a guy out there working for CBC doing a documentary with quite the equipment setup and with more patience than our family of 4. It was an easy hike and worth doing. You could also hike the Mary Schiffer loop which goes a fair way along Maligne Lake, but we opted for Moose Lake. There were two park rangers on the path carrying moose antlers and a ram's horn showing kids their size and weight.There appears to be lots to do at Maligne Lake - bathroom facilities, boat rentals, etc... But honestly, the highlight, in addition, to the lake itself, is the drive. One of my favorites ever. And that's saying a lot since it's in the same category with the Icefields Parkway and the Going to the Sun Road."
"Our guide, Cam, and skipper, Scott were very pleasant and knowledgeable. Beautiful lake and scenery. Highly recommend taking this excursion."
The lake is glacier fed and a beautiful turquoise. Great hiking in the area and canoe rentals available. A beautiful location and a great place to spend a nice day hiking and enjoying nature. Wear good shoes and bring water. There is a nice cafeteria at the lake
My husband and I recently enjoyed a one-hour hike along Maligne Lake. It was an easy walk and extremely scenic!
"Absolute natural beauty all around Maligne lake, so picturesque. With a huge car park that caters for heaps of visitors. The lake offers boat tours of this beautiful lake and its surrounds.We walked on a excellent path along the lake edge and it goes on and on. There are other trails that go into the woods. We did a bit of both and had a wonderful scenic experience.The lake has large grassed areas along its banks which many people relaxed and enjoyed picnics and the outdoors.This scenic drive from Jasper to Maligne lake will give excellent scenery and memories. A must visit, allow a whole day as there is a lot to do and experience."
"Definitely worth a 1 Hour drive down the road to see this lake. Once here, make sure to take the boat ride to spirit island. The views are incredible. There are many hikes in the area to take advantage of also."
"We rented a canoe for the day at the Maligne Lake boat house ($120) and spent a glorious day on the water. If you can manage the many many hours of paddling, this is a far more fulfilling experience than any tour boat excursion. The serenity and beauty of having this gorgeous lake all to yourself is absolutely a once in a lifetime experience. The tour boats pass by once every 30 mins or so until about 6:00 pm but in between those interruptions you feel so tiny amidst the huge mountains and the seemingly endless expanse of turquoise water. There's just the sound of the water, the birds and your paddles hitting the water. We were told that as long as the canoe was back before 8:30 the next morning, all was well with our 'full day' rental so we were out from about noon to about 9:00 pm and left the boat at the boathouse upon our return. You could possibly do the trip to Spirit Island and back in 6 or 7 hours if you're an experienced and strong canoer. We stopped a few times, took lots of photos and we don't canoe often so it took us closer to 9 hours. We also hung around Spirit Island for a while hoping to dock somewhere but that area unfortunately is designed for tour boats not canoes so we had to stop elsewhere for a rest stop. The round trip was just over 29 km. On the way back the weather turned a bit nasty so we had to stick to the shoreline which added time and distance. A more direct route mid-lake would be slightly faster and shorter than the route we took. It is important to be prepared for a change of weather, know how to handle waves and strong winds in a canoe and stay close to shore if the weather gets ugly. If there is lightening, you should not be on the lake. Also wear sunscreen and hats when it's sunny. You burn fast on the water. It was an awesome day I will not soon forget and a great upper body workout to balance you out after many days of hiking!"
"Make sure you allow a full afternoon, at least, for this beautiful drive and experience, there is so much to see. We did not spend time at Maligne Canyon as there were too many people. We rode our motorcycle, so glad we had that opportunity, it was wonderful ride, gorgeous scenery. The mountains are amazing. The lake was busy, many people had rented canoes/kayaks or were hiking the shorelines, but there seemed plenty of space to spread-out and enjoy. They have a nice souvenir store and cafeteria with the basics. Food was good, we ate on their deck, enjoying the incredible views. Wonderful photo opportunities. Enjoy! What a fun day-"
Took the boat ride tour on this astounding lake -- what a thrill. This is the easiest way to see great scenery. If we had more time we would have gone canoeing -- which is even better. Hard to believe much of the lake drains away by the end of summer only to be refreshed again with melting of ice and snow in spring.
"Maligne Lake is quite beautiful, but there are many other lakes such as Moraine Lake that are much more beautiful. We saw a black bear and elk on the way up and down however which was cool! There are many trails to explore the surrounding region."
"Book boat tour in advance! We tried two days in advance and could not get in. Still worth trip to lake. Walked trails, visited heritage buildings ."
"Nice cruise, but you have to reserve before you come to marina, they are very busy. Cruise is nice, crew was good, Kat and Mallory were officer,helpfull ladies, lot of informations."
It's spring when we went here and the temperature although it's goes up and down that day it was nice. There were a lot of people but not too much that we could move around the grounds and enjoy the place. The boat ride to Spirit island was nice and the staffs entertained us with wonderful stories. The island was really beautiful and you would wish you could spend more time to explore it. The drive going there is also lovely great views and if you're lucky you'll see a bear crossing. Ild say this place is a must if you're in the Rockies.
"We came to the lake right after we finished our hike at Maligne canyon. The road to the lake was spectacular! We were late for the boat tour, but we were just in time for private time on the small dock facing mountains during sunset. It was so quite, that for moment I could understand what silence really means. The sun was changing every 5 minutes leaving stunning shades from the clouds on mountains. If you need to think about something nice, and turn off your brain, recharge your body - this is place to be. Great times."
"We visited pretty much every ""must see"" lake throughout Jasper, Banff, Lake Louise and Yoho National Park and Maligne Lake was probably one of the more average lakes. At an hours drive from Jasper I probably wouldn't recommend this unless you are planning on taking the cruise (we didn't) and have time to spare. That being said the drive to the lake is absolutely stunning and may be worth it for that alone. The lake itself is pretty, but not even close to some of the other lakes we saw. It's so big it is difficult to get a good photo of it and we couldn't find any elevation to get a good shot. We actually preferred Medicine Lake, which you will pass on the way to Maligne.It's a nice place to mull around, do some short trails, have a bite to eat in the cafe or even rent a boat if you are inclined, but there are certainly better lakes to visit throughout the Rockies than Maligne, if you are short on time. If you have plenty of time in Jasper, certainly stop by here, the beautiful drive is worth it if nothing else."
"We didn't spend a lot of time at the lake, as it was raining. We had an enjoyable time, however, at the boat house standing under the protection of the eaves talking to a young man who worked there. His father had worked there before him and he was a wealth of information. It made the whole drive worthwhile."
"The lake is nice but after seeing other lakes in Banff and Jasper I think it is not the most beautiful one. Keep in mind that there is no hiking trail to reach Spirit Island so you have to take a boat cruise if you want to see it. It is a bit crowded with tourists specially because of the cruises.My recommendation is to do the hiking trail to Lorraine Lake and Mona Lake that starts from the parking lot of Maligne Lake. It is a relatively easy hiking trail (5 km) which is part of the Skyline trail. Lorraine Lake has an amazing shade of green and Mona Lake is incredible! Much more beautiful and quiet than Maligne Lake. Take a picnic with you and sit down by the shore of Mona Lake. It is not a very popular place so you can enjoy the views quietly, you won't regret it!"
"The lake is lovely - Very large and accessible. We rents a boat and had loads of fun. However, is quite busy. Happy we saw it and enjoyed the day."
"We chose Bald summit and took our time. It took us 4 1/2 hour to go and come back. There were good number of people on trail which gave me peace of mind about the chance of confronting with a bear. In summit, the lake and surrounding mountains which mostly covered by green forest are amazing."
We took the boat trip to Spirit Island and the lake was gorgeous changing colors from one end to the other. The glaciers and mountains were unbelievably beautiful. It was well worth the 50 mile drive and cost of the boat trip. High season you might want to make a reservation for the boat.
Ok so the drive is great so if that's all you get then job well done. Parking is horrible! Period. You can rent canoes and kayaks and had it not been raining we likely would have done that. As it was raining the restaurant was full and seemed like a disorganized school cafeteria than a quiet place to have a coffee. We will go back but maybe in a slower season.
"This would have been a 5/5 for me, but unfortunately, there was a group of boisterous young adult travellers who chose to smoke up in public, with couples and families around. Outside of this minor annoyance, this was another bucolic beauty to visit. Even though it was very busy, the weather kept much of the activity at bay and there were quiet pic-ready moments for a few of us with cameras and tripods; a visit, well-worth the effort."
The trip to the lake took us some time because we were driving in bad weather. Once at the lake it was hard to get a parking spot and we had lost our enthusiasm for the place. It might be worth the trip in good weather but I would not drive there again. :-)
"We did the 2:15 trip out to Spirit Island, which is the turning point (inc a restroom stop) for the cruise. The views of the mountains and glaciers were superb. There is no wild life to see on this trip, so if this is your desire stick to walking the roads as you have a better chance. The commentary was light hearted but informative. The boats are enclosed so you are protected from all weather. You can stand on the rear deck outside if you wish, once underway"
"Another beautiful place at Jasper. This is around 50 KM form the city of Jasper. Beautiful lake with a cruise (boat ride) to Spirit Lake. Carry poncho's/ rain coats and/or umbrella, you never know when its raining. Have canoe and kayaking rentals available. Short walk from the parking. The road from Jasper to this lake has wildlife sightings like bald eagle nest, black bears, sheep, deer etc. Animals are generally out during evenings. Good idea will be to drive BACK from the lake 6 pm or later. Same time the cafeteria and other things closes/ ends at the lake."
"Beautiful lake at the end of, unsrprisingly, Maligne Lake Road. Allow at least 45 mins to get to the lake and it is best to book your boat trip to Spirit Island in advance in Jasper town centre to avoid disappointment. Drive slowly up the road as you are likely to spot bears, especially in early summer. Lovely gift shop. Restaurant/cafe expensive and we had to return our sandwiches as the bread was stale."
"The drive towards te lake is beautiful, we saw a few bears. I advise to walk to the viewpoint of Mary Shaffer loop, there it is less crowded an you have a nice view of the lake."
"1st of all don't under estimate the drive time from Jasper to the lake. It took us over an hour.On arrival we had missed our pre booked time by 5 minutes. They booked us straight on to another boat. Due to the volume of people they put on another boat (10:15), the boat was only half full which was great as you could move around easily. We had 2 great tour guides who both took time to speak to us all separately. They also were willing to take pictures once we reach spirit island.The only down side was the weather it was a bit over cast to made pictures looks not dark. On return the guides told us of various walks to use around the lake and the difficulty.We took a walk to moose lake - what a beautiful tranquil place, we were treated to two moose foraging in the water. We sat for over an hour watching them wander in and out of the lake. Eventually the two were joined by a further moose. One took a swim which was amazing to watch. We only wish we had a better zoom on our camera. Unfortunately not all tourist appreciate the need to approach lakes quietly in order not to frighten wildlife.Would 100% recommend this trip.Coffee in the cafe is rubbish, toilets in main gift shop/ restaurant were in average condition. Outside seating area is currently being refurbished."
"Scott was our captain, Kate was our guide. Very courteous, kind, professional. Wonderful cruise. We usually like more adventure but this was beautiful! Well worth the price."
"Well I wouldn't go out of my way to go back. A nice area to stop, possibly better if you took the boat cruise offered"
There were very people at the lake when we were there. I wish we would have planned to spend more time to kayak or boat on this lake. It was so beautiful and peaceful. I truly believe that this is the gem of Jasper National Park!!
"This is a beautiful lake. We took the drive up here and saw a black bear cub, an eagle, and a few moose on the drive there first thing in the morning. Some of our group took the cruise to Spirit Island while the rest of us did various hikes in the area. There is a cafeteria, gift shop, and rest rooms. They recommend getting tickets online in advance but most of our group got tickets on the spot. Go early to avoid the crowds."
The lake is lovely although it does get quite busy. We got there at about 3pm and the boat tours were already booked up for the rest of the day. We were told you have to get there before 10.30am to stand a chance of getting on a boat tour.
"The drive up to Maligne Lake alone was worth the trip. The lake itself is massive and brilliant blue. The boat trip takes you out to Spirit Island, a tiny strip of land that is probably the most beautiful tourist trap I've ever visited. Although the whole Spirit Island angle is a bit hokey, the ride out and back is breathtaking. We watched bald eagles soar along, passed a few glaciers and enjoyed breathtaking views of the surrounding mountains on this beautiful lake."
"Fantastic drive from Jasper to Maligne Lake. We were lucky enough to see black bears and bald eagles on the drive. Unfortunately it was an overcast day at the lake but we still enjoyed doing one of the walks where we came across a deer on the track which was cool. Great gift shop, not just tacky souvenirs."
The lake has paths for hiking around it as well as boat yours and canoes to rent. There is also the ability to stop for a snack. The drive to the lake is quite scenic as well and we saw some mountain goats and deer along the road.
"The lake is great once you walk away from the parkinglot/giftstore/restaurant. Leave the loop trail along the lake and youll find yourself some great places and a bit of solitude if you are lucky. This is a smaller, offical trail (I asked at the park information), so this is totally okay with ""dont leave the trail"" regulations! It can be a bit muddy, but should be doable with closed shoes. The giftshop is one of the nicest ones we came across, some ""non-standard"" souvenirs that didnt seem to trashy (the pottery is pretty nice). The restaurant is very expensive, a capuccino for 5$ is way above the usual price (at other expensive places the price is close to 4$). The food also didnt look very good for the price. The road to the lake can be dangerous because a lot of people stop/get out of their cars to take picutres of animals, resulting in blocking the road in the stupiest ways possible."
The lake is very beautiful and there are lot of trails and a small beach area too. The food at the cafe was decent. But we had to wait a long time to go on the boat tour. The tour was good and Spirit Island was very beautiful but it was not worth the wait.
... Very touristy ... Drove around forever to get a parking spot. Ended up having lunch there and it was not ok. Second time there. Took friends this time - probably wouldn't go back again. So many other more beautiful lakes around. Didnt do boat ride but some said it wasn't worth the money.
This has got to be the most beautiful places on earth. We enjoyed a wonderful boat tour of this gorgeous lake. Words cannot adequately describe the beauty of the area nor the peacefulness it evokes on one. This is a must stop if you are in the area!
"We did not take the trip to Spirit Island this time. Just to sit and look at the lake and the mountains make this trip worthwhile. The lake has many moods depending on the weather and can be very atmospheric. A short walk takes you away from the crowds, so you can just enjoy the mountain scenery."
"I just travelled to Maligne Lake today. The road that you drive to get to Maligne Lake itself allows for many picture taking opportunities. You will also see evidence of a fairly recent forest fire Within the last few years.I had purchased my ticket as part of a package at the ice fields so simply had to check in at the desk for the first available spot to hop on a boat.The tour guide and pilot on our boat were Cam and Adam. Both of them young guys were friendly and knowledgable about the area. The boat ride out lets you learn about the lake and how it has been stocked with fish, when the most recent forest fire at the lake has been and what that will mean for regrowth.The boat ride last about 30 minutes on the way out. Your boat carries up to 50 people and everyone disembarks to take pictures of Spirit Island. Spirit island is in fact a very small piece of land with several trees on it not far from the shore. However, when you take the stairs/trail to the photo point, you're able to frame a lovely photo of spirit island and many mountain peaks behind it. You remain at the photo stop for 10 to 15 minutes and then return back to the dock.Is it worth it? I love to take pictures and would never turn down an opportunity that lets me see something and I would otherwise not be able to"
It is a big and beautiful lake in the Maligne valley. We can see a couple of glaciers at a distance. They have a boathouse for canoe and kayak rentals and they also offer boat rides to see the spirit island. We did the Mary Schaeffer hike along the lake and it was fabulous. We saw a caribou along the trail in close quarters. There is a lovely viewpoint about 700m into the hike. We concluded our hike in the tea house with tea and raspberry scones. Overall a lovely place - pristine and beautiful.
"Maligne Lake is the largest lake in the Canadian Rockies. There is a visitor center, dining cafeteria, and boat pier on the shore. In the early morning hours, you will probably have better chances of seeing different wildlife (e.g., elk, deer, bighorn sheep, bears, goats). Everyone wants to take photos of the little island called ""Spirit Island."" Bring your camera to take some amazing photos, including photos of ""Spirit Island."""
We didn't chose to take a boat trip as it was very expensive but there are plenty of trails to keep you occupied and an abundance of parking compared to Lake Louise. We took the Moose trail and it was beautiful but we did get bitten by something nasty. We could see what we would call midges but not quite sure what they were and afterwards they were very itchy and my husband had one on his eye that swelled up as if he had been in a fight and lost badly. We did see 2 lovely young black bears on the side of the road on our way back to Jasper. Very exciting for us Brits. They just wandered to and fro feeding for quite a while. Saw a couple of deer and a few squirrels but no moose or caribou in spite of the endless warnings. The damage to all the trees on the journey in from the Excelsior wild fire was also an education.
"It's a steep price for the boat tour, but I think that's the way to see the acclaimed Spirit Island. I also think reservations are needed to get the tour because there weren't any available at the time we were there. It wasn't hard to find parking space, unlike at Lake Louise."
"My wife and I were very excited to see this lake like we saw it on Google Image. Unfortunately we learned there that we would need to take the boat tour to see the island and have the beautiful view. It was a disappointment as the boat tour cost 65$... So we ended up not doing it. However we were able to see bears and rams between the maligne Lake and maligne Canyon, which was really cool."
We cruise with Kyle and Cam. Both made the trip very memorable. When we docked during the cruise both of them jumped into the lake for a swim. Quite an experience for all of us to watch since the water temp. was below 50 degrees.
"It's the best lake I have ever seen. It's an absolute beauty with blue and turquoise waters. The boat ride is a 35 min one way ride with a stopover at spirit island. It's a must do one!The view from the spirit island of the overhanging glaciers is spectacular. Have seen the spirit island pics many times but never realised it was at Jasper. The moose trail is an easy hike (it's a misnomer as Moose can rarely be seen). On your way to the maligne lake you would first pass the medicine lake which is another beauty. Tips: drive slowly and leave early. We saw many bears, elks, a moose and deer.If you are at Jasper this is a No miss one."
We went twice. Both times it was cloudy. I'm guessing it's beautiful when it's sunny. Hard to compete with the lakes I saw in Banff.
"Another beautiful lake in this gorgeous area, don't forget to stop at Medicine Lake too. Boat trip was very good and informative, weather could have been better. Cafe and gift shop on site along with car parking facilities. Did see wildlife - bears - on journey to and front this lake - amazing, made my holiday."
"It was a nice scenic drive to this lake and in between there are plenty of locations to stop and capture some beautiful views of mountains. On our way, we saw a grizzly bear crossing the road. It was awesome feeling. The lake itself is stunning beautiful with water being in blue color. The weather was so perfect (wasn't sunny or wasn't raining) and got few great clicks. It's really worth watching and I would visit again."
"My wife and I, as well as our girls (7 & 11) really enjoyed Maligne Lake and the boat trip out to Spirit Island. It was great to be out on the water surrounded by all of those majestic mountains. We would all recommend it."
"The drive to the lake from Jasper takes you through some amazing scenery passing Medicine Lake. The pictures that you can see on the web do not do justice to Maligne Lake. Towering mountains, turquoise water, glaciers, perfect. Helped by a cloudless blue sky, the boat ride to Spirit Island was absolutely breathtaking. The circular walks near the carpark are well worth the effort but plenty of mosquitos so make sure you take some repellent! Cafe and shop have a good range of products at reasonable prices."
"Maligned Lake (pronounced Maleen) is so beautiful there are no words to describe it fully. We took the boat over to see Spirit Island and the tour was very good and our boat captain and speaker were great! Very informative and very patient with the children who were on our boat. The colour of the water when you get to Spirit Island is amazing! Again there are no words to describe - i keep repeating myself, amazing, stunning, beautiful, incredible, spectacular!"
"This is a nice place to visit for half a day. Probably best to go early as it was getting busy by midday as we were leaving. There are a variety of trails and of course you can do a boat trip, paddle board, canoe etc.The drive from Jasper town is pretty. We saw a bear too! Make sure you stop off at the lookout en route: the view is spectacular."
"We added this on to our Icefield tour. Thought we might not make it on time for the last cruise of the day at 4 p.m. Apparently, though, they will send other boats out a little later if there are stragglers. It was overcast and drizzly but this did not hamper our enjoyment of the cruise. 35 minutes out to Spirit Island and a 10-15 minute stopover to step off the boat and tour a little. There's a bathroom there as well, the most expensive one ever built! Because no other boats were leaving we enjoyed some additional time circling to take additional pictures before heading back to the dock. It is an hour and a half cruise and a great way to tour the lake!"
"Nice lake. Can do a few hikes. About 45 minute drive from Jasper. We hiked to a hidden lake, nice hike and lake nice. Food available onsite. Can do a river cruise $65."
This was the only boat tour we took in the Rockies and I love being on the water so I'm a little biased.... but it was a relaxing and informative tour all while seeing beautiful scenery. Would do it again...
"To get the best from this visit, I advise getting up early. We left at 5am. Yes really.There is very little traffic on the roads and the wild life is out and about. We saw Black Bear, Moose, Mule Deer , Elk, Bald Eagle, all in the same morning. the bears were no more than 3m from the car and browsing on vegetation. the Eagle on the nest with 2 chicks at Medicine lake. The moose were playing or bothered by Ticks, we are not sure.In any event visit Maligne canyon on the return trip. Fantastic."
We rode down the road to the lake with stops along the way- the scenery and animals sighted along the way was wonderful.
The snow capped mountains and the blue water lake is really beautiful. You can do canoe or boat cruise. We did a hiking to moose pond not far away from maligne lake but there was nobody on the way there. Moose pond was not that interesting because the moose was not there. We only saw some ducks. Maligne lake is big and the snow covered mountain is far away.
"maligne lake is a beautiful lake.the day we went up was freezing,windy but we still went for a walk. its truly a beautiful spot. we had a rv so we made a cup of tea and sat by the lake. really magical"
"We had visited the Canyon in the morning and returns to Jasper to organise lunch and set off on the Medicine Lake and Maligne Lake. We pulled over at a lunch side parking spot and then continued on towards Medicine Lake. Stopped to see a black bear and cub and then continue past the lake on to Maligne Lake which has a length of 22km and provided boating, cruises and canoes etc. We found a small marked track to Moose Lake and decided to go along it as it is not long. We noticed some hoof marks in path and just ahead in light bushes a female Moose. A group of young women had just walked ahead of us noisily and saw nothing because they weren't looking? You need to walk steady and keep looking around to give yourself the best chance of seeing wildlife. We were about 15-20 m from her for quite a while taking some great snaps before she ambled off. Huge lovely animal who,for the most just ignored us. We didn't try to get too close just let her move slowly as she ate. A great day out."
Your drive to Maligne lake takes you along past medicine lake and on this drive your bound to see bears - on our return drive we managed to see 4 black bears at close proximity. At the lake itself it is the ideal spot for spectacular photographs but be prepared to do some of the various hikes that are round about - we did the moose llake loop which was not too bad. Good tea shop there where you can enjoy a large decking area over looking the lake
A beautiful lake. Easy access. Good trail on the periphery. Don't bother with the boat trip -- the wait is too long. just enjoy the scenery.
This lake and the view are stunning! Beautiful water and a nice background with all the mountains. On our way back to Jasper we saw a black bear and a moose. What a nice area!!
"This lake is literally at ""the end of the road"" and while the scenery is breathtaking, you could stop at Medicine Lake and be happy! The journey to the lake, however, is too good to be true. We saw a black bear ... and that's why we're in the park - to see wildlife!"
"Great natural area untouched by humansThe Milgne Lake is the largest lake in the RockiesOn the way to the visitors centre we saw an active Bald Eagles nest, a Black bear walking up away from the road and an Osspreys active nest. Superb area with interest around every twist and turn GO, you not very disappointed"
"Having been travelling around Canada for the last few days, we've seen lots of beautiful lakes, and this is another - lovely colour water, trees and mountains surrounding. Feels like we are getting blaze, but we're not. Still so impressed by landscape.It was cold (snowing) when we visited, so not conducive to strolling around or standing looking at the water, so cafe very welcome."
"This place is truly stunning. Photographs and words do not so it justice at times - I literally had my breath taken away and found my self standing on the shoreline simply staring into the distance. The drive along the 40km road to the lake is incredible enough, with the beautiful Medicvine Lake along the way, but the lake itself is definitely the best part. We luckily visited on a lovely, sunny day, but I would imagine the surroundings can be appreciated on an overcast day too (though perhaps not quite the same). We did a couple of loop walks along either side of the lake, but perhaps best not to do the loops and just walk the paths up and down the edge of the lake as this is definitely where the best views are. Look to spend several hours here and make sure you have a good camera with a lot of memory! The best place we visited on our trip through BC and Alberta."
This was a beautiful lake and the cruise was great! The extra effort to make a stop at Spirit Island sets this cruise apart from others. It gives you a chance to stretch your legs and get some pics from a different perspective. Gorgeous scenery!
"Maligne Lake is very long and narrow. It is spectacularly beautiful, rich with wildlife (moose, elk, bear, etc). The boat tour is expensive -- we didn't take it. Driving there from Jasper is bound to reveal wildlife -- each time I've been on that road I've seen black bear, also elk and moose."
"Wsnt to see bears, want to see deers and offcourse squirels. Go and visit Maligne lake. The road towards the lake gives plenty oppertunities to see bears and deers. The lake is great and the hikes are also."
"I've made the drive to Maligne Lake 4 or 5 times and have never taken the boat cruise! I hope that is not a blasphemous statement. Sure photos from the boat cruise look nice but I simply want to make the point that you can really enjoy the drive out and the vistas along the road accessible points whether you choose the boat trip or not. So don't pass up just a driving trip.On this trip we started the drive in the evening with no real agenda as the days were light to 10:30 pm or so. It was a great time of day for this drive but would never work if one was doing the boat trip as the cruises close down much earlier.For me the views along the way and at the lake are wonderful. We spent at least an hour walking up and down the top sections of Maligne Canyon and intended to only drive farther on to Medicine Lake. The stark, lengthy knife-edge ridges of the mountain ranges to the east are exceptional. I almost always have seen bald eagles around Medicine Lake on the way and did so again this trip. There were multiple bears and elk along the road and even a fox (I think) that made a mad dash across the road ahead of us. The kids were having such a good time on this drive that I offered to drive the rest of the way to Maligne Lake. We were able to do so and still return to Jasper before it was fully dark. My son more than anything enjoyed watching the really nice sized and abundant trout swimming in the water at the lake outlet that were easily seen from the bridge."
"Did the 90 minute boat tour on the lake, everything was amazing minus the overcast day...can't control the weather. Guide was friendly and answered all the tours questions. Had a nice 15 minute stop at the spirit island which gives the best views and the chance to do a short walk to get good pictures and have a bathroom break. The tours seem to go every half hour and were very busy so booking in advance may be a good idea during peak summer season."
"From the Jasper townsite the road to Maligne lake offers many attractions e.g. Maligne Canyon, Medicine Lake and hiking options. So you can take a full day in this section of the park and there is a good chance that you will see wildlife.Maligne lake is a beautiful location. There is commercial development there i.e restaurant, boat tours and boating. You can take a tour to an iconic location at Spirit Island, take a row boat onto the lake or simply walk the trails.The location is particularly beautiful about an hour before sunset."
Stunning lake with amazing scenery. Must visit. Saw animals on drive from Jasper. A momma moose and her calf came right up to feed on shoreline of Maligne Lake. (Apparently she is a regular there.) We visited Maligne Lake then drove back to do canyon hike.
"Went as a booked tour on our trip to the Rockies.The lake is approached down a road just off the highway past Jasper.We saw black bears along this road plus a bald eagle sat on its nest.At the lake there is a large car park plus ticket office, shop and restaurant. Nearby is a boat house where you can hire canoes etc to do it yourself! We were given a boat trip which left about an hour after we arrived. The boats leave from a jetty just in front of the restaurant. Boarding is interesting as there seems to be a rush to get to the front to claim the best seats. We boarded about half way down the 'queue' to find people had spread themselves down the sides so they had a window seat. I find this somewhat irritating as families did not sit together and any idea that others may want to see did not seem to enter people's consciousness. Sharing was none existent.The trip was about 30 minutes to Spirit Island where we got off, had a short walk and photo opportunity then re boarded for the return 30 minute trip.On the way out there was a commentary with information about the lake, people who discovered it, the mountains etc. The return trip was without commentary.We went on a grey day which meant any photos are not too good. On a bright sunny day the views would have been much better and photos too."
"Ok so we went to the lake the other day , it was a dreary day and we wanted to do something but not get to wet. Had heard the road there was good for wildlife spotting. Boy were we rewarded, we saw several black bears and were able to pull over for sometime (like everyone else ) and do some bear watching. Then on the way back we saw a moose, who frequent the area. So I was a happy gal.We did the boat tour really just for something to do, really I didn't find it that great, if you've been to lake Louise etc Louise is a more appealing lake, but the staff were funny and told us a lot about the area. Good rainy day activity - but if you don't go on the lake still do the drive there and get a coffee for your efforts."
"Great drive here, delicious coffee followed by a tour of the lake to spirit island . Captain Megan and mo were brilliant. Terrific views . This tour is a must for anyone in the area."
"The lake itself is worth the visit, but you really get a good experience if you're with a guide and then stop off at Maligne Falls, Medicine Lake (the disappearing lake) and maybe hike or kayak around Lake Magline. The guide can explain how the falls was created and where the lake water goes when the lake drains, etc. Plenty of wildlife in the area as well."
"What can i say, this was an absolutely stunning place, the scenery was amazing, so beautiful, relaxing and peaceful. There is a boat trip to Spirit Island which is a must, and an onsite cafe and restrooms. I can highly recomend this venue, you wont be dissapointed."
"Went there to Kayak, awesome experience, staff is nice. 1hr kayaking could be tiring if against wind. For those never been there before, highly recommended!"
"You have to travel about 50 minutes from Jasper to get here, but it is well worth it. The drive is scenic and we saw a lot of wildlife en route - black bears (yes plural), moose and deer. The views of the lake are phenomenal and they only get better. We did the boat cruise out to Spirit Island and it was essential to really seeing the full beauty of the lake. You are surrounded by mountains and glaciers, and it is beyond what a photo can capture. It was one of our highlights of the entire trip."
"My family and I loved the excursion to Spirit Island. As we got closer to Spirit Island, the colour of the lake water changed becoming more blue (something to do with ice/snow melt from surrounding mountains). We were fortunate to see Spirit Island as an actual island and not a ""peninsula"" since water level was high. The island area was very peaceful. Once we docked, the guides afforded us some time to take photos. There were some good photo opportunities - very picturesque. Unfortunately for me, I was attracting a considerable number of mosquitoes while they didn't seem to bother the other passengers. We had a very cheerful guide who gave a very informative tour of the lake. We purchased combined tickets for Maligne Lake and Jasper Skytram that provided a small discount (however, both tickets had to be used on same day). Cruise ticket price is quite high. Overall, it was a wonderful experience."
"From the day lodge boat ramps, the boat tours (providing informative commentary) travel about half way down the lake, from which impressive views exist. Boats stop for about 20 min to let travelers off the boat onto the land side of Spirit Island. It is here where perhaps the most photographed scenery in the rocky mountains exist - looking across Spirit Island in the foreground of Maligne Lake towards the imposing peaks and glaciers surrounding on all sides. You do not need to be a good photographer to take great photos when surrounded by scenery like this."
"The boat cruise had just opened for the season because of an unusually early Spring.The visitor centre had all amenities and was very nice.The boat cruise was superb. The beautiful colours of the water which changed dramatically according to the rock flour in the water were breathtaking as was the imposing backdrop of the Canadian Rockies. Despite the other 40 or so people in the boat the experience was tranquil.Our guide, Dave, was a delightful young man, polite, amusing, interesting and very lovely.Praise to our Captain, Mallory, who handled a situation requiring a second boat to meet us at Spirit Island with great calm and efficiency."
"One of the most beautiful peaceful places in banff Alberta,Canada Called Spirit Island. So so peaceful.!!! you will drop at the scenery.."
A very beautiful place to visit. Stunning scenery and the lovely old boat house. Makes it very pretty with the kayaks over the lake as well
We made the stop here after reading great reviews. Unfortunately lake was still frozen so the drive was not worth it. Will try again in the summer.
"A must visit place in Jasper and in Canada, beautiful lake nice cruise to the Spirit island, 20 min was too short, loved it all."
"Maligne Lake is a beautiful 44km drive SE of Jasper and is the largest lake in Lake Jasper National Park. The lake is approx 22km long and 97m deep. A great place for fishing, taking a walk along the many trails, hiking or cruising the lake on a canoe, row boat, kayak or do the lake cruise.There is a restaurant and accommodation there as well.Make sure you get a photo of the boat house on the lake."
"Take a walk along the lake side, paddle on the lake or just enjoy the view while sipping a cup of tea at the lake side deck. The staff of the cafe was friendly and helpful. Don't miss the boat tour of the Spirit Island."
"The scenery on the drive to Maligne Lake is spectacular, plus we saw a wolf, seven black bears, a deer, and a marmot en route! There are spots to stop along the way and enjoy the beautiful views. Maligne Lake is stunning and well worth the drive in. We were there in May and the boat rides weren't running yet; this all depends on when the ice goes off the lake."
"Our little one's first time rowing a small canoe... :) She was a bit puzzled, however enjoyed it most of the time.. The lake was serene and beautiful, although it was drizzling at the time we were on the lake, we didn't mind, really. I realized I was quite good at maneuvering, ended up with some sour muscles, but who cares? Just be noted that if you are not going there in peak season, the rental services might tend to close early, so try to check the time and don't miss it!"
"We visited the lake and it took my breath away just how beautiful it is, I could of stood there for hours just looking at it."
Awesome sights on the drive from Jasper to Maligne lake. Very beautiful. It takes about 2 hours to go there and back. You might see an elk or two - but other wildlife sightings in winter are rare.
Even on a overcast day in January the trip up the road past Maligne Canyon to the end of the road at Maligne Lake is worth it. The road has spectacular views the whole way with many spots to hop out and take some wintery photos. We didn't come prepared for winter hiking but we saw some fresh snowshoe tracks so you could plan to spend some time exploring around the lake.
"I have visited Maligne Lake twice, the first time the lake was still frozen so very disappointed but the last time it was one of the last of their season .The boat ride to Spirit Island was stunning, it was a beautiful sunny autumn day , we moored &had a great time actually filming, taking pictures of one of the most photographed place in Canada it was a wonderful place to visit, then a hooter from our boat crew told us we had to go back but it was just as good a ride back with little stories the crew told us .Dont miss the chance to see one of the wonders"
At the end of the road is Maligne Lake. A boat ride to Spirit Island is very recommended. The cruise is very informative isolating some of the points of interest along the trip. Restaurant and souvenir shops at the lake. Best to pre-book the boat ride in the peak season.
Have to take the boat cruise to see the iconic photo that is famous around the world. Need half a day
"A must see while in the Jasper area. The ride up on the motorcycle and the views at the lake were amazing. There was wildlife, rapids, beautiful lakes along the way. Maligne Lake and area was an amazing sight. Plenty to look at and do. Nice restaurant and souvenir shop as well.."
"We had read about Maligne Lake while researching for our trip. It was a rewarding stop while making our was through jasper to banff. The scenery was beautiful, and the hike was relaxing. I suggest bringing some snacks, hang out and enjoy the view!"
"The drive up is a bit long, but beautiful, and once you get there there are a lot of activities (paid and free) you can do. You can go hiking, have a picnic, take the boat to Spirit Island, rent a canoe etc."
incredible nature around the lake.Take a walking trail in the mountains it´s really amazing.Lot of wildlife
I visited twice as it was a beautiful drive. The first time I saw two black bears near the road and close to Maligne Lake Parking lot I saw two moose. The next day i went to the lake for sunrise and it was tranquil and beautiful. Highly recommended whilst you are in Jasper
"Couldn't believe these views, the water was crystal clear and the reflections of the mountains in the water was incredible. You can do some nice walks around, too. We went in October and it was very quiet; I can only imagine how busy it must get in the summer."
"We visited the lake and too a boat tour out to Spirit Island. The lake is wonderful and Spirit Island is magical. Although the boat trip is not a short one, it is well worth it. The mountains all around and the island itself all contribute to an almost spiritual experience."
"Had a great trail walk at the lake, did not see any bears there's... Wonderful mountain and lake views, will return and go on the boat ride next time. Would recommend stopping here."
A magnificent lake in a breathtaking setting. The drive in is amazing with wildlife along the way. The surrounding mountains are extremely imposing.
Many wild life seen. Just on the road to the Lake. Bears bears and bears. Once at the lake saw lots of deer. Water is calming and fantastic photo ops.
"This is another lake that shouldn't miss in Canadian Rockies. I think you can choose to ride a cruise, canoe or row boat. We chose row boat. My son loved it. It was a memorable experience!"
"This is one of the most beautiful area in Canada..
a must see when in Alberta...
The boat tour is worth every penny ,,just make sure you have your camera.."
Another beautiful stop in the Canadian Rockies. Took the tour to spirit island and saw nothing but fantastic scenery even in the overcast conditions its amazing.
"Absolutely gorgeous lake, sun was shining and the mountains were reflecting on the water. Well worth the drive from Jasper to see this stunning work of Mother Nature."
"The drive to Maligne lake was quite beautiful, we were there a fortnight after the forest fire so there was also the burnt forest remnants which was quite sad to see. We wanted to see moose but didn't find the mother with newly borns (she...More"
"We thought we would be out of luck getting to take one of Maligne Lake's boats out to Spirit Island after a huge fire that closed the only road to the lake for a couple of weeks. However, we were told and also heard on the news that it would be opening the next afternoon, and we were able to reserve a spot for the morning following. We were told that the boats went out every hour, but when we got there, we saw that they had really ramped up service because they had full boats going out every 15 minutes to get the large numbers of people taken care of who were so excited to get to do the lake ride. It was a nice ride out, very calm, and we had some time on land to view the beautiful ""Spirit Island"" with the snow capped mountains in the back ground. Glad to get to do this adventure!"
"Spectacularly situated, boat trips rather pricey. Makes a good combination with a walk in Maligne Canyon."
I personally prefer this area over the Lake Louise crowds.The non walkers in my family enjoyed the canoeing as I walked the trail to the end of the lake.Lot's to explore as in the many long hiking trails in this area.The views are breath taking.
"Reached this attraction by car after visiting the canyon (about 30 mins down the road). Whilst we were walking along the shoreline someone shouted out Moose!. There was a male moose swimming on the far side of the lake. He swam to the shore,shook himself and walked into the woodland. It made my day! Lake area was quiet at the time, it was end of season."
"We were here on a tour, but this was an Optional Excursion, which included a boat cruise to Spirit Island.This place is very beautiful and it was enjoyable.Having said that, for us personally, it isn't that much due to the fact that we had just been to Thousand Islands (NY & Canada sides) just a couple months ago, and Maligne Lake w/ Spirit Island palls in comparison - though the views from the boat cruise with the Rockies in the background were very good. However, in trying to be objective, and strictly looking at it from a perspective that we had not been to Thousand Islands, this side trip is very nice. We actually enjoyed the boat cruise, and especially the walk along the trail.FYI: Maligne is French and stands for evil. A priest, trying to convert First Nation people, had to cross a raging and unusually high river, which unfortunately washed away his supplies and pack mules, and while he probably didn't use language that we would probably have, muttered a few choice words, put a curse on the place, and called this place 'Evil'. Spirit Island is a really TINY island, but as they say 'it's not the destination, it's the journey'. This landmark is the destination of boat trips across Maligne Lake, with many views of the Canadian Rockies. It is 5,000+ feet elevation, 120' deep, and was stocked with rainbow trout and brook trout, in order to draw fisherman and tourists. Ironically enough, the introduction caused the slow disappearance of mountain goats in this area, due to eagles slowly moving into this area due to the fish population and the eagles also added goats to the menu!It was snowing lightly when we left for the cruise, though it later stopped and temperature rose drastically to a toasty 42 degrees by the time we got back. Dress in layers. Cruise lasted about 30 minutes, with the walk along the trail another 30+ minutes.At the gift shop, a quick snack of Corned Beef sandwich and split pea soup was yummy before we boarded the boat.If you have time -- visit Maligne Canyon -- probably about 30 minutes visit is enough."
"The cruise was quite enjoyable but I feel it was very expensive. $134. for 2 is quite expensive for most Canadians. It might not seem that much for the many Europeans and Americans that partake in the trip. I think there should be a special rate for families, students and seniors."
Came here for my 50th Birthday. Don't miss this. It's about an hour drive from Jasper and beautiful. Make sure you do the cruise to Spirit Island. Awesome
This lake features in much tourist literature as it sums up the stunning Rockies. We took the boat trip to Spirit Island. The further down the lake you travel the bluer it becomes from the glacial flour that is reflected. The boat trip was really good as the guide was a mine of information and pointed out a moose on the shore that we would have missed.If you see two lakes on the Parkway make Maligne one of them.
"Very beautiful view both on the bank and in the lake, did the cruise to the spirit island, but only stopped for 10min, too short, however view amazingly beautiful."
"Of all the stunning places in the Rockies this was the best for me. A super boat trip, lovely guides who were very informative and fun. Stunning scenery the whole way and the astonishingly beautiful Spirit Island. A photographers dream. An adventurers dream. And the best time is September - super fall colours, not so crowded. the best of the best. Apart from Emerald Lake which is also beautiful. Visiting lake maligne is free. The trip to spirit Island is not - but worth every penny."
"I loved this lake. The day before there was a freak snow storm on the Icecields parkway which ruined our tour from Banff to Jasper as it was a whiteout. But the next day we had a Jasper Brewster tour and saw this beautiful lake, much prettier than lake Louise IMHO. If you get to Jasper, stay an extra night and take in a tour to see the lake and waterfalls near there."
"We were fortunate to be able to access Maligne Lake on the first day that it was open to visitors after the forest fires in July. The road wasn't busy, nor were the stops at the lake. The views down Maligne Lake are breathtaking!!! If we would have known how beautiful the views are there, we would have planned on staying longer."
"Beautiful, tranquil and quiet! Its quite a long ride to get here from Jasper, but the views were beautiful, especially with the fall colors! When we arrived we got some great photos, we also saw a young moose hanging out!"
"When planning our trip to the Canadian Rockies this was a place we had firmly placed on our agenda. It certainly did not disappoint. The beautiful turquoise coloured lake set between two mountain ranges, the older Maligne range and the Queen Elizabeth range is a beautiful spot. We were lucky enough to arrive in the sunshine with fresh snow on the mountain tops around the lake. We took the boat trip up the length of the lake. A lovely trip with a good informative commentary. Well worth the trip to enjoy the views along the lake and from the other end of the lake where you disembark for a short while by Spirit Island (not actually an island)."
"We travelled here from Jasper making a few stops at picturesque locations along the way.The lake and the mountains are really beautiful however even though it was end of season the area around the cafe and boat trip centre was very busy - I hate to think what it would be like in high season.Some of our party did the 90 min boat round trip to Spirit Island, which they enjoyed greatly and were particularly happy because they saw a moose having a swim and then coming out of the water.The others did one of the trails. There are free trail maps in the boat trip centre and the staff were helpful advising us about a suitable trail which would take us about the same time as the boat trip, so we could all meet up again afterwards. As soon as we started on the trail we were away from the crowds and it was very peaceful giving the whole place a different atmosphere.We also used the cafe, which although looking like an indifferent self service cafeteria, actually had very good tasty and warming soup which we followed with cake and coffee - very yummy."
"the lake is very nice, to watch it's magnitude you need the boat tour that takes you to the spirit island (not spirit and not an island) with the most impressive views of the lake"
"A beautiful lake in any season. Lots of easy hikes around the lake, or take a boat around the lake. Cafeteria on site."
"There was a forest fire near Maligne Lake. The lake itself is very low. If you're in Jasper area, you can save the 30 min drive from town to this area."
We took the boat trip out to Spirit Island and had a lovely morning. We were right at the end of the season but still had spectacular weather and scenery.Our 2 crew members were fun and informative.
We had a picnic lunch in Maligne lake and then took a walk along the lakeshore trail. It was cloudy day so the color of the water is average. But the snow mountains were gorgeous. The lakeshore trail were surrounded by trees and other vegetations. It's very special and lovely.
It was busy in September with vehicles and motorhomes so it must be extremely busy in the summer months. We came across cars quickly parking and got out to see a male and female moose standing amongst the trees  good photos. You could spend a whole day here as lovely lakeside trails and views.
"A very touristic spot, Maligne Lake recieves the glacier water and is the second biggest of the world, 22km wide. IS a very cold spot and I havent done the boat trip."
"Enthusiastic tour guides and skipper. A very good day we had with sun and views of snow capped peaks with fall colours on the bottom. Lovely water colours. Spirit island is not really an island, and you are not allowed on the peninsula, but it did not matter at all. You do get time off the boat in the area to walk and take lots of pictures."
Amazing experience! We really loved this place. Again this is a tourist destination so we enjoyed it. Our guide was Mark from Australia and he has good knowledge of the mountains. The boat ride was 67$ per person plus tax but its definitely worth it. Pictures also came out superb!
"lovely lake well with the trip,lots of walks along the shore etc.the boat trip to see spirit island is with taking bu is a bit overpriced.but still a good place to visit"
"Nice drive from Jasper town, some 40 kms and then a boat cruise to spirit island makes it amazing. Very serene and quite location."
A bit far away from jasper town about 44km which you also have to come back.The lake is beautifull and you should take a cruise to spirit island. It is expensive though.The cruise takes about 1.5 hr go and come back.There is a restaurant next to the departure pier.There are several essy walks along the lake
"Great postcard pictures can be taken here! We took the cruise which is a bit pricey (around $140 for 2 ppl), but considering the 1 hr drive from the main highway, plus the spirit island! The lake itself is stunning when the cruise came to a stop surrounded by all the mountains. Spirit island is beautiful as well."
"It get's really busy here, due to the boat trips that leave to Spirit Island. If you'd like to avoid the tourists, go for a stroll to Moose Lake. It's about 1.5km one way through the forest. Although we didn't see any moose, we were told that they frequently hang around this area.There's a restaurant at Maligne Lake. It's outdated and food not to great, but the view on the lake is beautiful."
"My husband and I along with 51 other seniors from Tennessee were touring the Canadian Rockies. Maligne Lake was one of our stops. It was a beautiful day and we had a chance to take lots of pictures and enjoy the serenity of the lake. We took some pictures of the orange colored boat house with canoes in the foreground with the lake, trees, mountains and sky in the background. What an absolutely gorgeous site. You can rent canoes and go up to the Spirit Island which we didn't do. There just wasn't enough time to see it all. However, if you go, plan on staying and taking the boat tour. According to Trip Advisor reviewees, it is worth the trip and a must-do It is a 90 min. cruise and it departs hourly from the docks at the Maligne Lake Day Lodge. $67 for adults and $33.50 for children. June through Oct. Check the schedule for changes. There is also a 2-1/2 hr. ""Through the Lense Cruise"" where the local on board professional photographer assists you with taking home some famous shots. A wine and cheese reception is served during your return trip. The View Restaurant offers light meals, baked goods and beverages. It has a sunny southern exposure plus one of the most famous views in the Canadian Rockies. There is no charge for just stopping in to take pictures. But hopefully, if we can come back again, we will do it all!"
"We took a ""Wildlife and Lake Maligne"" combo tour from Jasper Lake Lodge. Not much wildlife which was disappointing but the boat tour of Lake to Spirit Island made it worth it. A beautiful, serene spot. The trip about 4+ hours including the scenic drive there and back. Our driver willingly dropped us off in Jasper at the end instead of at the lodge."
"This is one of the most beautiful lakes in the Canadian Rockies, and the only one where motor launches are available for sightseeing cruises. In good weather it is a remarkable 90 minute tour to Spirit Island and back. The only risk is that you will spend all your time taking pictures instead of seeing and absorbing this majestic lake and its surrounding mountains. One can also rent canoes to explore the lake independently and travel beyond Spirit Island."
Beautiful place. Must see. Do take some time to get here early and relax and enjoy the gorgeous nature.
"Lovely lake with a boat trip to Spirit Island, and with the knowledgeable, cheery Meagan to keep us informed. Very relaxing"
"I just love this lake especially for photos. The scenery, the walking trails, the deer, elk, bears you can often see just add to the beauty!"
"As we started the boat ride on the lake, we could see where a fire swept through one side of the lake several weeks ago, trapping our guide until a helicopter rescued her. We cruised down the lake, admiring the kayaks, canoes, mountains. The lake didn't appear to be very big, but it did take a while to reach our destination, Spirit Island, tucked away in a gorgeous cove. I liked it so much I even bought napkins in the gift store capturing its features. One can see the remnants of three glaciers. Don't expect a large island; that's not the point."
"I have to agree with previous reviews that this lake is not as spectacular as others in the Banff area. Very popular with tour buses so can get busy but there is a very good restaurant with an efficient self service system.When we visited it was cloudy so I suspect it would be more stunning on a sunny day. We did the Mary Shaffer loop walk which was poorly signed so that you worry you have gone the wrong way, but it was very pleasant along the lake and then through the forest to get back to the visitor centre.The drive there was very picturesque."
About 90min of beautiful scenery. our only negative comment is that you are allowed 10mins at Spirit Island which seems very short.
"Maligne Lake is a must see in Jasper. The drive to the lake is gorgeous. There are great views of mountains, rivers, and lakes, and wildlife is commonly seen (bears, elk, goats). The boat rides on the lake are very entertaining. The trip to Spirit Island takes you all the way across the lakes offering views of the mountains from a variety of perspectives."
"There is no doubt Maligne lake is beautiful. However, we spent a few days in Banff and Yoho National parks before Jasper, so I couldnt hide my disappointment when I finally got to Maligne Lake. Compared to Moraine Lake, Lake Emerald, Peyto Lake, Lake Louise, Bow Lake, and Waterfowl Lake, there is nothing special about this lake. This lake didnt even impress me as much as Lake Minnewanka in Banff. Its a good 40 minutes drive from the main road in Jasper until you finally reach Maligne Lake. The boat tour to Spirit Island is not cheap, but it is something you have to do to make the trip to Maligne Lake worth it. The scenery along the lake becomes so much more magnificent when you are closer to Spirit Island. Of course Spirit Island is just as picturesque as its described. Again, it is beautiful, just not as beautifully breath taking as the other lakes."
"We enjoyed walking around part of Maligne Lake on a beautiful, sunny afternoon. The bright blue color of the lake was perfectly set off by the surrounding snowcapped mountains. We did not take the boat ride but liked the opportunity to walk away from the busy boat dock to a more quiet area with fewer walkers. The Bald Hills and Opal Hills trails are nearby and are good options for those who are up for a more strenuous hike."
"This was the final stop on s 16 day road trip. We had a great and informative time. Our guide had three years experience and was very friendly. The lake is a wonder and anyone who doesn't love it, is just nuts. This area is among the most beautiful on earth."
"We generally shy away from tours as we feel many just aren't worth the price. For Maligne Lake we made an exception since we didn't know if we'd ever make it back to the area again. We're sure glad we did. The boat ride provided exceptional views of the lake and surrounding area. The guides were friendly and welcoming as they told us information about the lake. The highlight really are the views. You can't appreciate them unless you go further down the lake. Spirit Island was beautiful, we spent about 20 minutes there. Afterwards the Captain took the boat even further south to get even more views. All in all, this was fantastic boat tour and at $67 CAD (about $50 US at the time) it was well worth it. Comparing it to other area tours (like the Skywalk and Columbia Icefields), it was actually reasonable and worth every penny. We enjoyed it so much we told ourselves we need to find a way to make it back here."
"We were very lucky to have the weather clear up, right before our cruise to Spirit Island took off. The cruise is expensive, but I found the guide very knowledgeable and the views from the boat breathtaking. Of course the small stop to take some pictures of the mythical Spirit Island was the highlight of the trip. Such a beautiful place. We also hiked up to Moose Lake (a short and easy hike), but sadly didn't see any mooses. We did encounter lots of mosquito's though, so use insect repellent!"
"nice cruise experience
best place I know for sunset photograph in Jasper
Fishing should be fun as well"
Can only rate this as average because we stopped here right at the end of the day as it was the end of the road. Only did a short walk because time was getting on so can't really say how good anything here is - did see one of the boat trips returning.
"Spent an afternoon here as part of a tour around the Rockies. Despite it being quite hazy due to massive wildfires in Washington, this is a beautiful place to go. We went for a walk around the edge to a waterfall on the other side which was really relaxing and beautiful. Not as touristy as Lake Louise, which is not far away. A couple of our group went canoeing which looked fantastic. I would highly recommend, probably more than Lake Louise!"
Went for a 3 hour walk around the edge to find some Moose. Unfortunately we did find no Moose but the walk was beautiful. The views were great and i would highly recommend it. Also had some friends that did the boat trip instead but I think that we got more out of our walk.
"My wife and I spent two weeks in the Canadian Rockies and we spent several days in Jasper National Park. The trip to Maligne Lake was well worthwhile! We went early in the morning and the parking lot was full early on. We decided to take the boat trip, and thoroughly enjoyed it. The guide was fantastic! We learned a lot! The scenery was awsome and we thought it was one of the highlights of our trip. The food at the park was very good, especially the chili and the scones. Great bakery goods for a national park!This is a have to see part of the national park.Bruce and Janet B."
Drove up here one evening in september. Didnt see any wildlife but enjoyed a dusk walk around the beautiful lake. Some beautiful snaps taken and a lovely walk. Free car parking too.
"We are surprised that this does not get higher ratings on Tripadviser. Maybe people find the cost of the boat trip ($67 per adult) too stiff. Perhaps also the variable weather means that you can get to Spirit Island (one of the most beautiful and most photographed spots in Canada) and discover that there is no photo because of fog, rain or cloud. BUT...we thought it was worth a gamble and it paid off big time. After a very pleasant drive up, stopping at Maligne Canyon on the way, we experienced pretty gloomy weather at the ticket office. Helpful staff explained that the weather can change in minutes and that the weather at the far end of the lake may well be different. Knowing that we would probably never come here again, we went for it. This was the most beautiful place - as we reached the end of the lake, the weather cleared. One of just a few box canyons around the world, you are surrounded by mountains on three sides, with Spirit Island providing a good base for taking photos. The 90 boat tour, including a short 10-15 minute stop on Spirit Island was over quickly. A helpful guide provided information ab out the geology and history of the place during the cruise. But the enduring memory will be of that breathtaking panorama of snow capped mountains - way better than Athabasca Falls (currently rated no 1 on Trip Advisor for this area)."
"We came here in Aug 2015 and went kayaking in Maligne Lake. We did an all day rental but the weather can get pretty unpredictable. When we started it was partly cloudy but while kayaking... about 1.5 hrs in, the winds started to pick up and we were nervous it was going to start to rain. However, the scenery was fantastic and kayaking was a lot of fun!We also did Bald Hills later on the day but the weather got pretty bad when we started to get the peak. I dont recommend the hike because there isnt enough reward scenary wise for the amount of hiking needed for it. Maybe it would be better on a better weather day"
Maligne Lake and the boat trip to Spirit Island was magnificent. Surrounded by vast huge Canadian Rockies it is an unforgettable trip. Have your breakfast or lunch in the cafeteria at the Lodge. The photo looking south from the stop at Spirit Island (a small island) is one to take.
"It's a lovely lake to look at, the tour boat operators are all very friendly and even the cafeteria they have there is good. But to spend 90 minutes on a boat ride and only get 10 minutes to explore Spirit Island is just plain silly. We could have skipped this one."
The lake and the surrounding area is stunning. Great trail system near and around the lake. You can go for a short or longer hike. The lodge and restaurant are good. Plenty of picnic tables with nice views.
Awesome tourist attraction. Plenty to do and see here. The ride up the road on motorcycles is a must to do.
We went on the maligne lake cruise to spirit island. The weather was fab and the scenery was out of this world.
"I know it sounds terrible to critisise a lake in the Canadian Rockies but... you drive the round 30 km trip to see a lake with expensive boat trips @ around 65 Canadian Dollars each (£32). Once you arrive at the lake, if you do not want to go on the boat trip, you can walk around it, have a snack at the simple restaurant, pop into the gift shop or hire a kayak. Given it's at the very end of the road with no-where else to go other than return, it was not the most inspiring experience."
...but I was not willing to pay more than 50 Dollars for the boat trip. The part which you can see walking is not that spectacular. Morraine Lake is way more beautiful in my opinion.
"Maligne lake and Spirit Island are two iconic places in Jasper National Park. While it is possible to book tours right in Jasper, we drove out ourselves and boarded the boat tour right at the lake. This was our second time on the lake but the first for my sister and brother-in-law who accompanied us on this trip.We had a beautiful day with clear views, although not much wildlife. The recent 966 hectare fire (July 9/15) was a surprise and shock to us."
"We visited this lake after seeing several glacial lakes in the Lake Louise area. Perhaps it was the time of day, but it was difficult for us to see the color of the lake. We did take a boat tour out to spirit island, but we did not do any hiking. There is a nice café/restaurant that you can purchase food at as well as hot and cold drinks. The facility also includes a gift shop and nice bathrooms. There is a lovely deck which overlooks the lake with many picnic tables. It was a relaxing way to have a picnic lunch and enjoy the outdoors. The parking was adequate, although we arrived fairly early in the morning. It seems that it could get quite busy during the midday timeframe.The drive to the lake is on a good road and we were able to see bighorn sheep right on the road as we travel to and from Maligne lake."
"This place, along with the iconic Spirit Island, is a must-see when in Jasper. Unfortunately, we visited on a day when the smoke from the forest fires in Washington and Idaho had completely obliterated the views of the mountains. That was heartbreaking. However, we did see moose, elk, and deer. Also the lake tour allowed you to see enough of the outlines of the spectacular peaks surrounding the lake to tell you that it must be heartbreakingly beautiful on a clear day. I shall return!"
"Beautiful lake canoe trip, great weather and the location is second to none. Only drawback is the tour boats every 10-15 min."
"Did this as part of a tour, our guide Cat was funny and informitive. Stop at Spirit island was too short, another 5 min would have made all the difference. Really enjoyed it."
Do not miss the chance to visit this lake. The river cruise to Spirit Island is well worth it. In my view it offers the best photo op in the Rockies.
"48 km from Jasper, Maligne Lake is the biggest lake in its aera, the wide open water surrounding by five summits, you may enjoy the lake view by boat cruising or lakeside trail."
"Takes about one hour to get here from downtown Jasper. The lake is just beautiful and this 90 minute cruise is well worth your time and money.
NIce gift shop and dining facilities are available."
We took the cruise to the spirit island and it was beautiful. The tour guide was informative and interesting. Wish we had more time near the island.. The souvenir shop near the parking is pricey but has decent collection.
"My family and I went to maligne Lake with 2 canoes hoping to rent another once we got there. To rent a canoe there was 90 bucks which was a bit much so a part of our group drove to the other side of the lake and launched the canoes while the others took the shore trail and walked along the edge and we swapped off halfway through. We had a great canoe and hike, saw lots of wildlife and enjoyed the calm of the lake. If you are on the lake be careful of the cruise boats, they cause big waves for the canoes. The fire damage is also pretty interesting along the road up."
"This is the second largest glacier fed lake in the world, second only to Lake Baikal. We hiked the Mary Schaefer loop counterclockwise, starting at the visitor center and proceeding along the lakeshore, then turning off through the forest and looping back to the visitor center. The trail is easy and level, though I would advise turning back where the trail veers away from the lake, as there is not much scenery after that."
One of the best places to relax and spend few hours. Drive from Japser to Lake is very scenic. Hike around the lake is very relaxing and Breathtaking scenery.
"Nice place to visit at Jasper National park, but not as beautiful as Moraine lake at Banff National park. I found Spirit Island a bit disappointing, there is nothing really special about it"
"This is a great place to visit. The boat cruise is well done and you get to see some beautiful mountains and spirit island. The lodge is very nice, food is great, and service was great."
Breathtaking scenery. Very popular. Go early. Did short hikes around both sides of lake. Decent lunch in cafe but very crowded.
"The road to Maligne Lake from Jasper is a good occasion to see the typical Canadian Rockies wildlife. We saw black bears (eating berries just aside the road !) and elks.However, unfortunattely, a part of the forest near Medicine Lake, had been burnt 15 days before...and the landscape was apocalyptic...and the Bald Eagles had left.The Maligne Lake is impressive. Very long and not much wide.A very pleasant place to picnic, have a rest and take advantage of great sightseeing."
Wow! What a beautiful lake. Definitely take the boat tour to Spirit Island. You don't get a lot of time on Spirit Island but the view is amazing. A beautiful way to spend 90 minutes.
We got there on a cloudy day. Thankfully we arrived around 8am there and the sun was still shining with only 3-4 people there.I advise you to do the same or even earlier as the early sun gives great colors to the lake and the close mountains.We did a small hike around the lake: scenic views!
"Stopped here on our Rocky Mountains tour, and it is a very nice and scenic place. Got some great pics, lots to do if you have a day to spend here. There is a small gift shop and cafe with some good food options. You can go on a cruise on the lake and hire your own boat if you prefer. Worth visiting."
Easily as beautiful as Lake Louise! Gorgeous blue water surrounded by mountains - breathtaking! Beautiful drive from Jasper.
"One can only stand and gaze in awe at such raw and pristine beauty. This would have to be one very special place in Jasper National Park and there are many. The boat ride was spectacular, with friendly and highly informative guides, fresh mountain air, refreshing mist from the wake and so many spectacular photo opportunites... Just don't forget to breath it all in for real. A must do at least once in a lifetime. The spirit is definitely alive across this magnificent lake."
"Our day on this lake was a highlight of our week in Jasper and Banff National Parks, and of the lakes we saw offering canoe rentals, we were glad we picked this one for paddling. Like most points of interest during the peak season within the parks, this any place within 1/4 mile of the parking lot is overrun with busloads of tourists with selfie sticks looking for their next meal. The best way to leave them all behind is to get the all-day rental. We were out for about 4 hours; after the first hour we'd left all the other boats behind and saw only a couple others by the time we reached our furthest point. We brought picnic sandwiches down from Jasper and had an absolutely delightful picnic at a beautiful spot with spectacular views. Can't say enough about this experience, it was a real treat."
"The tour was beautiful. The 90 minute tour gives you lots of chances to take good pictures of the mountains, the glaciers, some wildlife and of course, Spirit Island. The facility is clean, with a restaurant, two gift stores and clean washrooms. The staff at Maligne Lake ( Nathan ) was very friendly and polite. The same thing can be said about our guide ( Greg ) . But the girl who works at the main office in Jasper ( Kirsty ) was exactly the opposite: She was unfriendly and rude, not even a single smile when we went there trying to book the tour. We were the only customers at the time ( around 7 p.m. ) but she treated us like if we were an inconvenience. I was going to book two tours for my whole family, but I finally booked just one because I did not like the way we were treated. Someone like her should not be working in the tourism field."
"The lake was simply stunning. The water, the trees, and the mountains made for a delightful picture of nature. Wildlife seemed to be in abundance too.Our group of six had reservations for ""High Tea"" and it was very nice. It was a little pricey but worth it. My husband said, ""it was a once in a life-time experience."""
"I kept thinking I'd get tired of seeing gorgeous lakes, but no, didn't happen. Maligne was beautiful. We had an easy day and did the small hikes around the lake. Gorgeous."
"No trip here is complete without taking the boat to Spirit Island - which we did. The tourguide was extrememly knowledgeable and gave us the history of the area. Not to mention the views, the ambiance and the idea of you being in such a beautiful place. When you get to the island, you feel as if you are looking at a postcard. Just beautiful!"
We spent 3 nights backcountry canoeing here in July and it was breathtaking! Fisherman's campground is prettier than coronet Creek but both are lovely and past spirit island the Lake gets even more beautiful (and windier!) Visiting spirit island after tours had started was magical... Collect driftwood on the way (not at the campsite) and bring warm clothes. The whole canoe back from coronet Creek to the boathouse took us 5.5 hours (no breaks) You must book 90 days ahead! It's worth it!
"... then you planned a poor holiday, but make it the boat cruise to Spirit Island. The views are incredible, the color of the water is amazing and the island is almost entirely unspoiled. Took off a point because if you are on the back deck on the boat ride - which you should be - you can't hear the guide, who I imagine was providing some useful context about the lake and island."
"About a hour from Jasper depending on how many stops you make (for views) before hand. Once you get to the lake, there is ample parking - the busiest section is closest to the lake, but there is more parking a bit further. Washrooms are located in each of the parking lots, and in the building with the store and cafeteria. There are some nice trails as well as canoe rentals. Views are incredible and some of the nicest you will see anywhere. Well worth the trip."
Boat tour to Spirit Island is amazing- a must see. Very informative and captures the essence of Rockies! Gift shop is most helpful and will ship goods to you- lots to choose from!
Another beautiful lake in the Canadian Rockies with very beautiful color as well as very pretty scenery all around. Nice lake to hike around and to have your lunch/picnic.
"This lake is beautiful, it's huge there's a cafe toilets lots of good walks all paved nice. The car park is free and huge. We opted for the rowing boat, is was a beautiful way to see the lake but wow it's a long way! It took us 7 hours and we didn't get to the island! we saw it was the far corner though! the mountains are amazing to look at! we saw eagles along the way in the trees which you wouldn't of spotted front the boat tour. The main issue was the staff at the rental, we had to tie our own boat up and try and get out, we told them we had tried to tie and she didn't care. There just kids so not very good."
"At the beginning we were not very fond of it (after seeing Moraine lake, Emerald lake, Medicine lake,...), but when we took the boat tour we fell in love with it. It is a huge lake and the only way (if you not have enough time to trek) to see it is doing a boat tour,.."
"A good hours drive from Jasper itself but very well worth the effort as it is so beautiful, scenic and memorable. The trails around the lake are graded and you can easily find one to suit your abilities. Unfortunately the mosquitoes got us in the forests but it did not spoil the magnificent scenery. The unfortunate downside to this fantastic place is the terribly expensive boat trip on offer at the only jetty which was $67 in July this year with no seniors discounts on offer. Not tourist friendly that ! But mosquito and expensive boat trip aside , this lake and surrounding area is very much worth a visit."
This is one if not the biggest lake in Jasper. So beautiful! The drive is very scenic and watch out for goats and sheep along the way. Many viewing platforms from every angle so take your camera.
"This is a beautiful spot with a number of hikes radating from the lake area. You can hike, fish, rent a boat, grab a quick snack, or just sit back and soak up the natural beauty. For those who know Canada's mountain parks well, it's reminiscent of Cameron Lake in Waterton Lakes National Park."
"Make no mistake, Maligne Lake is beautiful. We enjoyed the visit, and the drive to get there. However, compared to Maligne Canyon, it was a bit boring.We rented a canoe for 1 hour...good value, and a memorable experience.Stay away from overpriced restaurant... Cafeteria food at high prices. Typical tourist gouge. Instead, pack lunch and enjoy it from picnic tables or overlooking the lake."
"Beautiful clear blue water, glaciers off in the distance and lots of wild life. Take a cruise on the lake on the tour boat. See the mountains up close and maybe see some wild life along the way. They take you around the bend to an area people can get off the boat and roam around for a short time and the Spirit Island. It's a beautiful site! And make sure you check out their million dollar bathroom facilities. There is also gift shop and snack bar to check out. The drive alone to Maligne Lake is beautiful. A definite must see!"
"Maligne Lake in Jasper National Park is extremely picturesque and the blue - green waters, so soothing. We visited the lake on a clear sunny July morning and the drive through scenic countryside was pleasant. We took a boat ride to the Spirit Island. The snow capped mountains and glaciers are majestic. A couple of hours in these pristine outdoors and one returns, completely refreshed and recharged. The boat ride needs to be booked in advance, specially during peak season."
It is a long way out to Maligne Lake but it is certainly worth the drive. Not only is the countryside on the way out magnificent but you are wonderfully rewarded when you get to Maligne Lake. We went in the afternoon and went for a walk along the lake edge. It is so pretty. You can hire canoes and go for a paddle or take a scenic lake cruise on a boat out to Spirit Island. On our way back into Jasper we were rewarded with a black bear walking along side the road. So wonderful !
"We went down here on a local recommendation. Pleasant drive down, good roads, including free range goats. You need to book the ferry in advance as it gets busy
Nice afternoon out"
"The lake is pleasant and full of tourists. Trails are well marked and informative. The Canyon is much more spectacular, but that is, of course, just an opinion!"
If you're in Jasper you MUST get to Maligne Lake. There's something for everyone and the drive in and from is amazing. Especially right now you can see the burn scars from the lightening strike that caused forest fires in the maligne range two weeks ago. If you want an awesome but strenuous and steep hike then tackle Opal Hills. It takes 2-3 hrs for a strong hiker. And the views in the valley at the top are awesome. Be careful and prepared to encounter wildlife.
"We drove the Icefields Parkway and only at the entrance to Radium had we seen wildlife...2 black bears. Feeling a little bit let down by the bears, we read that this drive was well known for wildlife. It did not disappoint! Among other wildlife, we saw another 5 black bear and 2 grizzly bear. Made our Canada week long drive all the better. So happy we drove thru this area. Just beautiful!"
Road close while we go there on 19 July. There was wild fire at the forest before Maligne Lake. Call Jasper Tourist Information before you go to the lake. You will spend your time 3 hours more return (driving from Yellowhead) only to know road closed.
"Another lake in the area. Picture perfect like the many more. Boating is available on the lake. I really like the many trails , not too difficult and not too long. Also saw kids jumping off the ramps into the water and having fun and saw people lounging on the narrow strips of sandy banks on the shores of the lake. Very serene and green. You can spend half a day or more around the lake."
A beautiful lake. Take the boat trip to Spirit island to gain a true appreciation of the scenic beauty of the lake. It is definitely worth doing.
This is a scenic lake with a couple of cool hikes around it. We went to Moose Lake and saw a moose and did another short one. If we had turn I would have hired a kayak for two days and taken our tent and sleeping bags for an overnight trip to the other side of the lake.
"Take the small boat ride on this beautiful lake to Spirit Island. Amazing views, peaceful, magical nature and very friendly staff. Take a look at my blog where I write and photograph my travels www.anitaozo.com for more information."
"Take an early morning cruise to Spirit Island- were were on a 10am boat cruise and missed most of the tourists. Its freeing to be out on the boat and letting the breeze run through your hair all while learning some history of the area. 360 degree views all around you- it's so surreal. Spirit Island is OK, but the pictures of the scenery are well worth it. They serve food at the lake, great choices and outside seating. You can also enjoy many hikes around the lake and into the hills- we enjoy the Bald Hills hiking trail that gave you amazing views from up above- one of best hikes of the trip!"
Enjoyed a walk on one of the many trails around the lake. Just don't go without bug repellent. Good cup of coffee and restrooms.
Tons of tourists land up here. The lake is beautiful but nothing spectacular compared to its peers in the region. There are several trails around the lake and a paradise who want to picnic. They have boats that take you around. There is a cafe and a restaurant which serve decent food. One can easily spend 3 hours here.
"Lake Maligne is lovely, as are several other lakes in the area, each in its own way.We took the boat trip although we thought it over-charged, probably because of all the ""not-to-be-missed"" reviews and effective PR by the company running it. Apparently the company was on lake Maligne before the Jasper National Park was declared, otherwise unclear why the Parks Canada facilitates this. Although we enjoyed the trip, we felt it over-rated and that there was no justification for the seventy something C$+tax we paid for out tickets. Our recommendation is to enjoy the scenery from the trails or rent a canoe or Kayak to really appreciate the ambience."
"Lake Maligne is very pretty. If you walk the trails around the lake you see different views, some where the water is blue and others where it is a beatiful green. There is a large complexity souvenirs, and food, and good toilets."
This is one of those stops that you cannot miss if you are close to the area. A hike around has the most awesome views and it was breathtaking. The little chalet near the parking lot has a cute dining room and fireplace....all very inviting.
Drove up here from Jasper..took about an hour but was a straight road once you got onto maligne road. The scenery is just stunning. Got some food in the cafe before taking the boat cruise. Recommend booking this before just arriving as tried to book at 9 am but had to wait to the 2 pm trip. We booked in Jasper town on Patricia street. The scenery was just stunning and after the safety talk you could sit out back. 35 minutes down to an island and you got 10 minutes there where you dibble your feet in the lake and some brave soles where jumping off the jetty too. Then 35 minutes back. Would highly recommend this peaceful cruise as the scenes are brilliant. They also give you a guided talk on the boat about your surroundings but as I was outside the whole time I didn't hear much of it. Staff where brilliant both on the boat and when we booked and collected our tickets. Really good afternoon though.
"This is a big lake and the boat is a good way of seeing most of it. There are some good trails to walk, just go equipped and stay on the marked trails. Then have coffee and cake when you get back."
Loved the fact that the lake was still partially frozen and the little boat shed looked awesome for photos..
"From the town of Jasper drive on Maligne Lake road. Stop at the Maligne canyon to see how the tumultuous waters of Maligne river carved through the limestone and formed an impressive canyon. See the Medicine Lake, that disappears by September, they say. Then arrive at Maligne Lake. It is the longest lake in the Canadian Rockies (22 km). We took a 2 1/2 hour cruise on the lake. The most beautiful part of the cruise is Spirit Island and the Hall of Gods. It is really unbelievable. Such beauty, you cannot imagine exist!!! Spirit Island represents the spirit on the Canadian Rockies. And the Hall of Gods, well, the name tells everything. Breathtaking images and a must see!"
"Maligne Lake was on my itinerary for our family's 20 day Trans Canada Odyssey, from Toronto to British Columbia (Yoho National Park) and back, right from day 1. I had read raving reviews of this natural wonder close to Jasper and had seen many images of its blue waters backed by knife edged jagged mountains in the background. This HAD TO BE SEEN, I told my son and his family when we talked from my Hyderabad home with him in Toronto.So during our stay in Jasper, after visiting Patricia and Pyramid Lakes, we made a beeline for Maligne lake via Maligne Canyon and Medicine Lake en route. After we had trekked though Maligne Canyon which was a bit of a come down, we drove past Medicine Lake whic hwas anther gem, its greenish blue waters backed sharp edged mountains making a fantastic scene.After a brief stop, we moved on to Maligne Lake and our first sight made our grandchildren come out with ""wows"" and oohs and aahs. Mind boggling, said my son. It was just mesmerising!!!We drove towards the Visitors' Centre and after getting our tickets, wandered down to the lake which was absolutely stunning. We had been told about the cruise to the island in the middle of the lake which we had read was one of the most photographed pieces of real estate in the world!!! But our budget did not permit it so we enjoyed the ambience sitting on the shore and trekking its shores.The visitors' centre and cafetaria were well located and provided a grandstand view of the lake so we just sat around and watched the cruise ships come and go, disgorging passengers by the dozen!After a couple of hours of ogling and having finished our picnic lunch, we packed up and made our way back to Jasper---- but on the way had a fantastic view of the sun shimmering on Medicine Lake, making it a silvery shade of blue!!On the return we also visited Lake Edith where we got a stunning sunset view with Mt. Edith Cavell beautifully reflected in its still waters.Still further, just as we were entering Jasper, we had a chance meeting with a female moose crossing the road right in front of our car----- a wonderful end to a wonderful day!!!"
"Had a fantastic day last Friday, saw a black bear on wY up, the drive from Jasper past Medicine lake is spectacular. Hired a canoe for the day and spent 4 hours exploring the more remote areas, impressed with the cafe area and shop. Returned back in the evening along the same road for an amazing experience seeing a black bear feeding by Medicine Lake. Well worth a visit."
Maligne Lake Rd leads to the lake itself. You'll pass through Medicine Lake and end up where you need to be. If you visit the lake early in the morning then you can skip most of the crowds that eventually make their way late morning to afternoon. It's a magnificent sight!
We rented a kayak and spent whole day there. The silence there is mesmerizing! You hear only water and birds - unbelievable calmness. If you want to escape from people and enjoy nature - this is the best thing to do! And did I mention amazing mountains?! The lake and mountains is worth seeing!!!
"We were able to book one of the back country camp sites at Coronet Creek at the end of Maligne Lake and it was so worth it. Definitely one of the highlights of our trip. We were only able to get one night so it meant we paddled in one day and back the next. There is a boat launch area and the further you paddle down the lake the more beautiful the scenery. The mountains, the waterfalls, Spirit Island, you have beauty in every direction. We canoed in and it took us about 4 and a half hours thanks to a storm that came up about 1km past Spirit Island. but that it all part of the adventure. Also once past Spirit Island there are no more tour boats and it is so peaceful. Even on the lake where the tour boats are allowed they are very good about slowing down so they don't cause too many waves. The end of the lake is so beautiful. There are 8 tent pads, 4 fire pits, 4 picnic tables, and an interesting throne for your personal needs. No wood is provided so we brought some with us. This turned out to be a blessing as we and the next group to come in were all wet and chilly from the rain storm.We hope to make this trip again and next time we will hopefully get to stay longer."
get there for 9am before the bus tourists come and you have the lake to yourself. we canoed for two hours and saw common loons and it was beautiful and quiet. the hikes around the lake itself dont have much in terms of views but worth it for an hour or so. lunch at the cafe is casual and a good way to unwind post canoeing and hiking.
Beautiful lake with a blue color that is prevalent in lakes in the Canadian Rockies. Make sure to kayak or canoe the lake for the best experience.
"We skipped the boat ride at Maligne Lake although other reviews highly recommended it. Instead we rented a 2-person kayak and found ourselves in the tranquil waters surrounded by mountains. Spirit Island is a 3-4 hour paddle - one way, so the tour boat is the only way to see it, but the tranquility of being on the water was a highlight of the lake. Be sure to take an iconic photos of the boathouse with the colorful boats and surrounding mountains. There are also canoes and row boats for rent at a cost much less than the $65 boat tour."
A very long drive but well worth it! Beautiful lake! We saw two black bear right in the parking lot. Stop at Maligne Canyon on the way.
"The staff were friendly, the facilities were clean and the restaurant offered delicious treats to full meals. I enjoyed our time there recharging our phones and enjoying a scone and cuppa tea."
"This is what you come to the Canadian Rockies for and above all do not miss the boat trip. It only takes you to Spirit Island (and back) but really worth it. Another of those views - seen before on-screen or somewhere, but not the same until actually seen"
"we left early Jasper to be able to see wild life.Came to Maligne Lake and saw deer just on the street.The boat was leaving shortly,destination Spirit Island.When we left, sun was shining,Spirit Island we had little bit of rain,but beauty of Island was veryspecial on the return was sun and rain and when we got out of boat was snowing, the lake has mountains all around- that's the reason for it."
Went on a boat tour of the lake.Enjoyed it so much the commentary was interesting and the views amazing great to do also there is a restaurant near the boats that had quality food.
"Stunning location, beautiful colours and surroundings. We had perfect weather for our trip to the lake, even seeing a bear with 2 cubs near the roadside on our way up, and a black bear literally walking along the road on our way back down! Made the day even better!"
"The boat trip costs $39 or so but is worth it. The bay at the end of the lake, near Spirit Island is so surreal -- really spiritual! Try to go in the morning on a clear day."
This lake is a must stop. Check it off from you bucket list when you visit. It is considered one of the most beautiful places on earth and for sure it is. It os closed on winter time and on summer can get very busy.
"We visited the lake in May and it was frozen over , but still a very tranquil and beautilful place to visit , great photo opportunities.There is a visitors centre there that does food and sells gifts ,we just had some soup so can't comment on the food The drive there was very scenic too , with Lac du Medicin on route ,which was where we encountered a bear walking along the side of the lake ,so we got some good pics .There are several walking trails in the area of varying lenghths, but we had gone for the drive which took about an hour from Jasper and we thoroughly enjoyed it."
"The lake was picture perfect with the boat shed and surrounding snow capped mountains. We didn't take the cruise to the postcard location but were still impressed by the scenery. The local café provided a reasonable lunch option, especially the soup.As with a lot of the Rockies Area it was hard to take a bad photograph"
"I highly suggest a stop here and a walk around. We kayaked and it was AMAZING! We didn't make it all the way out to spirit island barbecue it's a pretty far kayak, but it was still breathtaking and wonderful. If you don't want to canoe/kayak, there is a boat tour that can take you, as well as several hiking trails."
"I went with my family in May. It's about 1 hour road trip from Jasper but once you're there everything is wonderful!. The view is amazing and even though the lake was frozen you can enjoy a nice walk around and take some great pictures. If you decide to go, make some stops in all the touristic points because all of them are unique and beautiful. You'll also enjoy wildlife on you way!!!!"
"There are several trails available at Maligne Lake (2.7 km Moose Lake Loop) to the Bald Hills (10.4 km with a 500 m elevation gain).
The Mary Schaffer Loop (3.2 km) is the most popular trail and it's fairly easy."
"We did the drive out to the lake on a really grey, wet day, but it was still beautiful, and am sure it would be amazing on a sunny day having seen the postcards and pictures.The drive out to the lake though from Jasper is one of the best places to see bears, and we were lucky enough to see 2"
"The best views of the mountains in Jasper. At one point of the lake cruise, you are completely surrounded by the mountains. The family pictures we took from the boardwalk on Spirit Island, with the lake and the mountains in the background are among the best we've had. The buffet dinner we had at the Maligne Lake Restaurant (arranged by Trafalgar for our Canadian Rockies tour) was plentiful and delicious."
It is definitely worth taking a trip to the lake and booking one of the 90 minute boat trips. An informative tour around the lake and the chance for fabulous photo opportunities on Spirit Island.The drive from Jasper to the Lake itself is well worth keeping your eyes pealed on!
"Great place, spectacular views and hikes!Tons of wildlife around, drive by a bear and a mountain goat on the way there, walked by 2 elk, and drove by another bear on the way back.The drive to Maligne Lake is beautiful and fun to do, the Lake area itself has canoes and a cruise, plus numerous awesome hiking trails (of various difficulties) and a cafetertia/gift shop. Lots of stuff to do for people of all types and ages.A visit to Jasper area isn't complete without visiting Maligne Lake!"
We visited this lake while staying in Jasper. On the way out we were lucky enough to see black and brown bears with cubs just on the side of the road. We also saw a bald eagle on a nest. The weather wasn't all that good on the day we went to the lake so visibility at the lake was restricted. It's a reasonable drive to get there but well worth the time. There's a great restaurant at the lake with heaps of food choices and an excellent souvenir shop.
"Maligne Lake is pretty big, in fact they do boat trips that let you see the views from a different perspective (about 35 minutes each way with 15 minute on spirit island at the far end. The boat trip is quite pricey though ($65 each) It takes about an hour to get to the lake from Jasper but you may well see bears and other wildlife en route. There is a large cafeteria with all facilities so you can make a day of it if you want although unless you do the boat trip then there's not much else once you've taken a few photos.The route to and from the lake takes you past Medicine Lake and Maligne Canyon, with worthy of a closer look."
"Anyone who have been to Banff knows the bow valley parkway is the best route for wildlife viewing. For me, the road to Maligne Lake from Maligne Canyon is even better. I have drove to Maligne Lake around 4:30pm and I spotted 8 black bears and 2 deer. The Medicine Lake is in the middle and there are often big horns hanging around the lake. Maligne Lake is beautiful by itself. You can hike around the area if you don't want to pay for the cruise."
"We decided to get up early and drive to Maligne Lake before to many people arrived. It was a good choice as on our way we were lucky to see some reindeers and also a black bear that was walking down the road (this made our day). When we arrived at the lake it was calm and the reflections of the mountains on the water were beautiful and stunning. There are boat trips to Spirit Island, canoes to hire and if you are energetic you can walk the trails. As other people have stated, it is weather dependant and if you get a nice clear day you will not be disappointed. Even so, it is well worth the drive."
We took short walk before giving in to mosquito swarms. In order to see the famous spirit island you have to pay $67 per person for a boat ride. Way too expensive for us. We only stayed a short while. Drive to the lake was scenic.
"The young woman told us that if we wanted to find a moose, try Maligne so we did. We got up early and headed out. We parked in a parking lot just past the boat house and headed along the shore. We then turned in towards another little lake called Moose Lake. It was a perfect moose habitat but sadly,it didn't have any inhabitants. The reflections of the mountains on the lake were well worth the trip. We talked with a local fisherman as we were leaving and he had just seen a moose on his way in. He told us where he saw it and lucky for us, it was still there just grazing in the meadow! After watching him for about 20 minutes, we moved on. On our way back we saw a big black bear right on the side if the road and then further up, a mother black bear and her two cubs. We also saw a pair of nesting bald eagles. There is lots to see whether you take the boat tour or not."
"Prepare to be awestruck by the beauty of this lake. We were thrilled when our stroll around the water revealed a moose and her baby; I later read that moose like to stomp people. The 90 minute boat tour passed scenic vistas to Spirit Island where you can explore and take postcard-like photographs at every turn. For a longer visit, kayaks, canoes, and food are available. Maligne Canyon down the road is lovely too. Did I mention we spied bears as we drove from Japser townsite?"
"Maligned Lake is a very pretty lake near Jasper. We primarily visited to see the view, but ended up watching people rent canoes at the boat house and watching the lake cruise boats. We also stopped at the lodge for a snack, and were pleasantly surprised to find that they provided drinking water, ice, and cups  which was definitely appreciated on this hot day!"
"what a beautiful place with tons of history, activities and wild places. the tea house/ accommodations are really nice, a bit rustic and modern at the same time. the boat ride to the most recognizable Rockies landmark ever, Spirit Island is very entertaining( our ride was at any rate). the breath taking beauty of it all is so worth while to take the time and stop, walk, ride,relax, breathe."
"We did not take the boat ride, so didn't really see Spirit Island which is the main reason many people come. We did hike to Moose Lake (separate listing) and walk mainly along a trail along the east side of the lake. It is worth the drive no matter where you are in Jasper."
"Such a beautifuly drive up the mountain, many stops to make along the way. We did the Lake tour to Spirit Island, it was very well done, with lots of information provided by the guides along the way."
Spectacular lake surrounded by mountains. If you go in late May don't expect to eat dinner at the restaurant since they closed at 4:30.
We visited here on May 20th and a good portion of the lake was still frozen so we couldn't do the boat tour but it was still one of the most beautiful places I've ever been. The sun was just right to cast a perfect reflection of the mountains on the surface of the thawed part of the lake. I can only imagine what this place is like when completely thawed. Lunch was good in the cafe and the weather was perfect!
We drove ourselves. The speed limit was only 60 km/h so it took a while. We stopped at Maligne canyon and also stopped to photograph a bear on the way as well as deer. On the way back we saw another black bear by medicine lake. The lake is beautiful but with plenty of mosquitos. We didn't do any of the hikes and the boats were finished for the day.
The drive to Maligne lake is scary for the weak at heart. There is a boat cruise that takes you to the little island called spirit island. There is a trails and picnic areas for you to enjoy and a gift shop to buy your souvenirs. Some boat rentals for canoes are there for a fee as well as food. A patio is also in place to eat. Wildlife is always here watch out for bears
"About 38 kilometres from Jasper but allow an hour as the speed limits are low and if you get behind an RV the drive will be even slower, but once you get there is is spectacular and you can just sit and soak in the view, read a book or take a trail. There is a boat trip to spirit island but we just sat and looked at the view. You can also hire canoes if you are energetic. We just lazed around."
"Ok there is the potential for fantastic photos and views. A lot depends on the weather. You need to take the tour boat out to 'spirit island' to enable you to see the whole lake. Now the boats they use are designed for bad weather and have a large enclosed cabin and small viewing platform out back. Now if your photographing the last thing you want is a boat wake in every picture, and that's what you get with the way the boat is set up. On the day we went there was late cloud which did not clear until we left spirit island. Which was a shame.Sand flys abound in spirit island so take some rid.The lake is a must do but views are very dependant on weather."
This is an absolutely beautiful place. The boat trip is informative and the scenery amazing. Spirit Island is just there to make your photos perfect. The drive out from Jasper is lovely and we were lucky enough to see a black bear by the roadside on the way out and a mother with two cubs at the edge of Medicine Lake on the way back.We were there on a tour so any costs were included. There are some steps down to the boats.
"We did an afternoon trip to Maligne Lake on our own because we took our own vehicle. It is a beautiful drive on the way out and back with places on the way to stop and look around. At the lake we just hung out on the edge of the lake for a few hours and dipped our feet in, but only for a bit because it is super cold. We walked around some of the trails around the lake which are nice and mostly shaded. Next time I would like to take a kayak out on the lake."
"If you are blessed (as we were) with a clear, sunny day, you will never forget this little piece of paradise. Great trails to get different angles for photos of lake reflections of mountain-top snow. Maligne Lake and Lake Louise were the photographic highpoints of our trip."
Visited in the end of April. It was so quiet and peaceful. The lake was still frozen and strong enough to stand on. The surroundings were beautiful to look at!
"WOW! I am not sure what was more amazing, the water or the peaks. There are many buses that come and go so if you are traveling by car just take a bit of time and you can pretty much have the area to yourself to soak in the grandeur. I highly suggest taking a side hike nearby.We did the Constellation Lake trail and it was a lot of fun. Bears roam nearby so obey the signs and hike in groups of 4 or more. The 2 of us just waited at the trail head and within 10 minutes we had a group of 6 and all left and returned together."
"This lake has incredible scenery! We drove past what looked like the main parking area, went across a bridge with a fantastic view, then pulled off and parked in a lot. There were washrooms but they were closed (April). We followed the path along the lake a little, then turned off onto Moose Loop. That was an incredible hike on a tramped down path in the snow, just us, our hiking poles, and the sunshine. The trail led to a small pond then looped back on a wide path along which someone built a huge igloo! Good times!"
"This is a good day trip from Jasper a pleasant drive up from the Jasper town site is well worth the effort with many stops to take in the views. Spirit lake is a mystery lake that can be full of water or empty, the local Indians would camp at the lake and wake the next day to a n empty lake hence they named the lake Spirit Lake. As you climb the valley to get to Maligne lake the views are spectacular and keep your eyes open for Bears Elk etc. As you approach the lake if there is any sun you will see the most beautiful colored lake in the Rockies with an Emerald green which has bewitched thousands of tourist for countless years. There is boat trip up the lake which is well worth the time and it will take you to the World famous Spirit Island, there is a great restaurant which serves a good lunch and you can spend the afternoon wandering around the lake and just enjoying the ambiance of this natural wonder."
"A great place to visit, peaceful and tranquil, you can soak these wonderful scenes standing on the shores, taking a kayak tour or join a boat cruise."
We drove the 40 km from the Jasper town site to get to Malign Lake. The road going in was a bit icy but all in all it was a beautiful drive. There was good parking once we arrived at the Lake. There are public bathrooms in the parking lot. Nothing was open so bring food and water if you are driving out that way. There is no cell coverage for most of the drive in. We did the Mary Schaffer loop which was about 3.5 km and the path was a hard packed single file trail. Half goes along the lake and the back end goes into the forest and since it was a gorgeous winter day it was a beautiful walk. So quiet and peaceful. Lots of trails to snowshoe and XC ski. It was well worth the drive and i would recommend it even in the winter time.
"Beautifil lake. Unfortunately the weather was not at its best the day we went, but we enjoyed it all the same. The drive up is very attractive. We stopped at Medicine lake and got some superb photos.There is plenty parking at the lake, and a couple of shops and a restaurant. There are also boat trips and canoing available, although we did not avail ourselves of these, as we only had a couple of hours there. It was definitely worth the journey though.Only disappointment was the weather, but that's not in our control. It did mean however that I bought myself a rather nice fleece, as it was colder than expected."
"Maligne Lake is touristy, but it is easy to get away from the bus tours. There are hikes around the lake that are fairy quiet (some are rather rigorous) as well, you can rent boats to get away form the crowded tourist shop and viewing deck. Along the lake there are a few picnicking sites and a couple of camp grounds that are only accessible by boat and provide great views of the lake most don't get to see. The old chalet is a great place for lunch and they serve a fabulous afternoon tea that's also a good deal ($34). If you want to have the afternoon tea make sure you have reservations and at least an hour and half to enjoy the excellent food and views of the lake (Its not worth rushing through). You can also pay a little extra to get a ""sparkling tea"" which means you get a mini-bottle of sparkling wine with your meal. There is a good selection of teas to choose from, the food always has arrived in a timely manner, and the staff have always been friendly. Another nice thing is that the afternoon tea has its own area separate from the main dining room (its in the area surrounding the dining room on all for sides) so you get good views of the outdoors and quieter space."
"We first visited Maligne Lake 51 years ago on our honeymoon, and were amazed to find it exactly as remembered. The old boat house and scenic stand of trees are virually unchanged! And I am happy to report that the addition of an access road and cafeteria/store did not detract at all from the beauty and adventure of this excursion. Our tour was by SunDog, and included wildlife sightings and enjoyable commentary by our knowledgable and very interesting driver. Highly Recommended."
"You don't pass this lake on a main road, so it is worth making a special effort to drive this way, and if possible follow the road to the end of the lake and beyond. The combination of the sparkling lake and mountains beyond make for wonderful scenery."
From Jasper we took a drive to the lake in a sunny but cool day. The views are beautiful and arriving to the dock we went on a boat tour. Very nice girls were running the spot and were very good guides explaining the scenery. When arrived at one of the isles we were able to have a short walk and to enjoy the nature.On the way back we had lunch at the nice cafeteria.It is a place not to miss when visiting the area.
"A stunning hunk of geology the photographs well. It is a beautiful drive from Jasper and I saw a caribou. The boat house, the bay, the mountains were all great photo fodder."
"After hiking the Bald Hill trail, enjoyed a little shopping and lunch at the Lakes facilities. They had a lot of nice items to purchase and the meal was good as well. Self serve, cafeteria style."
This is a great area to stop for photos. There is a nice path around the lake. Boats available for rental. A very scenic area.
It was a nice trip into the mountains... this time we have decided to see a new Lake..Maligne Lake. What a beautiful place to visit..Nice picnic tables to relax and have a bite to eat. Enjoy the outdoors. Rent a Canoe.
"A truly magnificent lake at the end of a beautiful drive from Jasper. The lake is wonderful on its own, but the big attraction here is the boat tour. We took it many, many years ago and it was great. There's a very nice day use facility with a cafeteria and gift shop."
I went for short hike around the lake with friends. Beautiful scenery. Great views for Rocky Mountains. There are good few paths you can choose from. There is a chance to rent a canoe from the boat house or take a cruise. Amazing photo opportunity. If you are lucky enough you can find some wildlife around. great place for a picnic. Huge car park nearby and restaurant. great place to spend a day.
"Beautiful scenery like straight out of a paragraph, especially with the boat house in the foreground."
"Worth the drive. Absolutely stunning scenery and vistas. Lake cruise is expensive but a must, as you get to Spirit Island and 2/3 along the lake. Great commentary and good shop/ food at the lodge. (Aussies in Canada)"
"The fall drive was beautiful! Wish we had time to take the boat trip on the lake, it was a gorgeous day! September is a good time of year to go as there was fewer people."
We arrived early and enjoyed less people movement. The lake walk was excellent (can be very cold early so dress appropriately).
"If you are in Jasper, this is a must do.The lake is big, awesome and not so crowded, also because big parking spaces are available. Scenic pictures can be taken from every point, and it's wilder and more untouched than other famous lakes in the Rockies. Good chances to spot wildlife, even in the middle of the day. However trails are well maintained but rather short... You can walk only 2-3 Km along the shores, then you can't proceed. The cafeteria has reasonable prices for such a known location and boat tours are available upon payment. The road is quite long (40 Km from Jasper) but well maintained, and panoramic."
We weren't sure whether we should come here or not since our satnav and google maps said it would take us close to 90mins for the 45km drive. We did it and it didn't take that long. But I'm sure it can take a lot longer in high season with RV after RV.The place is stunning and once you've been there you know why that lake is on every second postcard around.
"This place is phenomenal for photography. The scenery is gorgeous, smells great and plenty to do. I loved hiking here and I usually come back each year"
"From the center of Jasper it's a 50 km drive alond very pretty and scenic route. Speed limit is kept in check and there are few overtaking places so if you get stuck behind the endless moving chicanes that are RV's then just relax your right foot, mellow and take in the breathtaking scenery.Stop off at Maligne Canyon for an hour or two or just pull in one of the many picnicing sites along the route and chill.The lake itself is beautiful and the mountains quite spectacular and there are a number of walks that you can do depending on the distance or time you wish to spend. There is a restaurant/cafe, toilets and gift shop on site and you can also hire canoes/kayaks for self propulsion on the lake. The prices were not extortionate here as they were in Lake Louise and other places and the scenery is fantastic.There is also the tourist trap of boat trips to Spirit Island but we had read the reviews before going and decided it wasn't for us. However, that did leave us wanting to do something whilst we were there but apart from retail therapy and the canoes there was little else here to entertain you. Great because it was unspoilt (well as unspoilt as a fleet of tourists boats would allow) but a long drive that felt like it needed more of a purpose.If you like hiking then you will be in heaven here but apart from the fairly expensive boat trip then there was little else to commend it apart from Mother Nature herself."
"If you take a walk along the lake shore you will soon find a tranquil spot you can spend hours just relaxing. The emerald lake cruise is very expensive, we didn't have the time for it but have only heard good things from others we talked to."
Beautiful with a nice easy (2mi) walk through the forest to Moose Lake and along Malign Lake. There is a boat trip on the lake but it is expensive. The Lodge is quite nice and has good food.
"Maligne lake is one of the premier attractions in Jasper National Park. It is a bit of a drive from the town, but the drive is quite nice and scenic. There is a large parking area near one end of the lake. There is a big gift shop/restaurant complex there, too. Lots of buses full of tourists, too. The area around the gift shop was a bit crowded, but not too bad. The trails were deserted. I did not do the boat tour although it looked like a good way to see the whole lake. I THINK it cost about $40 or $50, but that is just what I heard. There were canoes for rent, but unfortunately we didn't have time to go paddling and hiking both, so we went hiking. There is a short trail around the end of the lake. It follows part of the shore and then goes into the forest. a nice short trail. Nearby is Moose Lake. Also worth the time to see. A nice trail of maybe 2 miles or so to get to the lake. As we had hoped, there was a big bull moose swimming across the lake when we got there. He didn't come close to us, but it was the only moose we saw all week so it was really cool. Others saw moose right near the tourist area of Maligne lake just before we got there. I would say the best time is in the afternoon when the sun is at your back looking down the lake. We were there in the morning and the photos were all backlit. maybe not the highest energy hiking, but the views are great."
We went there...twice. The weather wasn't very good on the first day so we decided to try again the next day for the boat trip to Spirit Island. We really enjoyed it. The guided commentary was excellent and taught us a lot about the history and geography of the place.We also hiked around the lake.The road leading to the lake has a few stops that you can make such as the interesting canyon. We also stopped at Medicine Lake where we saw some bears.
If you are not going on the boat trip then dont bother to go - simples. Stays at jasper and go elk watching
We walked part way around the lake. Fall colours of the leaves were out standing. Air was clear and wind was light. The drive up to the lake was beautiful with the mountains and lake. The road is twisty in spots and is up the whole way to Maligne Lake.
"Excellent approach, much quieter and more peaceful than other hugely popular locations. Well worth the journey to see, walk around this almost idyllic lake."
"The lake about an hour's drive from Jasper, but well worth the effort. The drive there is beautiful with a good opportunity to see wildlife. At the lake, we rented a canoe and had a wonderful experience padding along the lake with the beauty of the surrounding mountains. There are boated trips down the lake which we heard were also great."
"Like - stunning scenery, wildlife on the drive from Jasper, tons of parking, lakeside restaurant serving good, wholesome food at a very reasonable price (excellent beef stew, bowl of chilli, rolls and coffee for less than C$20), easy, well marked trails to walk. Dislikes - the lake cruise was overpriced."
"Interesting and beautiful lake, nice trails to follow, long or short around edge, plenty of carparking although can end up in different carpark to the one you started in after the walk! Not much wildlife but maybe on account of lots of people. Boat trips available but we didn't go as no time, restaurant and rest room facilities good."
Paths around it a bit slippery and in need of clearing as tree branches to trip on. Water a nice blue colour with mountains as a back drop
"The light dusting of snow everywhere added to the magic of the place. The boat trip itself is nothing special but the lake is set in wonderful scenery. The tour from Jasper was excellent and the local guide helped us to see Big Horn Sheep, Elk, Black Bear and Cubs. Such a fantastic experience, hope to return one day."
We took a tour from Jasper that took us to Maligne Lake. We learned about the history of the area and saw beautiful scenery and wildlife. There is a boat tour available on the lake.
A nice lake. However being from Vancouver Island it wasn't too far off from what we see at home. It didn't have the blue glacier water of some other lakes. However very nice. Worthwhile if you don't live near scenery like this. There was a restaurant and a gift shop there.
The lake is beautiful and has many trails. Boat rentals. Restaurant has surprisingly good food. A really nice spot to sit and relax.
We took the boat ride to Spirit Island. It was worth every penny spent! I particularly liked how the young man who was our guide interacted with the people on the boat. He was very knowledgable and answered all questions.
"It is an incredible lake, the boat that takes you to the Spirit Island is fun. Get a seat at the back, once the boat starts you can leave the cabin and go sit not the back deck, great for photos. Best time to go is the last boat. In the summer is the photo cruises that last longer and go out longer so the light is better."
There is a small path that goes by the lake. We only went to the Moose turnout and headed up to Moose Lake.
"My friends and I rented 2 canoes in advance from On-line Sport and Tackle and paddled 9 miles/14 km to Fisherman's Bay campsite. It was an amazingly gorgeous paddle and we had tons of fun. The weather was spectacular both days! One thing to watch out for are the cruise boats, which are supposed to slow down when approaching canoes and kayaks so their wake doesn't flip them. Some of the cruise boats were respectful and cautious while others didn't bother to slow at all. My friend and I are experienced, but some of the waves we hit could have easily capsized an unsuspecting, inexperienced boat. I'm not discouraging anyone from going out, but if you are just going out for a paddle for a couple hours, stay close to the shore. I think the cruise boats should face fines if they flip a small boat over (if they don't already). Our campsite was also beautiful and we were able to just unzip our tent and bask in the glory. Spirit Island was pretty, but we didn't understand the hype. I think there is some spiritual significance to it that probably explains it, but we never heard it."
friends recommended Maligne lake and it was beautiful. not our favourite but probably second on the list. Good boat trip and enjoyed a bowl of soup in the cafe. not sure about all the hype regarding spirit island!
"We had planned to just visit the lake and stay at water level, but then we through down the challenge to hike the opal hills loop...the day after a reasonable snow fall. WOW... Winter wonderland in the pine forest was beautiful. Beware tho, this is not for those without a reasonable level of fitness/stamina. This 8-10 kilometer round trip (3.5 hrs) is tough work but once you push past the short breath and straining thighs it gets easier... Getting to the top and pushing past the hills and you tell yourself the hard work was worth the views. We loved and we know its not for everyone, but if your into a hike and have a few hours to kill, then do it. So worth the satisfied feeling we got out of the journey."
"Having done a boat lake trip elsewhere we felt the boat trip here was too expensive and probably more of the same, so just walked around the surroundings free of charge which was good enough and free of charge....well worth a visit."
"We thoroughly enjoyed the cruise and learning new information from the tour guide about the area. The views are spectacular and the area is gorgeous for canoing, hiking and just being. Well worth the short trip off the highway. We were so lucky to have such a beautiful day. Read some of the info plaques around the Maligne Lodge and was amazed again at the vision and adventurous spirit of the pioneers who recognized and developed the national parks for everyone to enjoy for decades to come."
"There are several lakes in the several National Parks that alternate as my ""favorite""; Maligne Lake (pronounced ""Muh-Leen"") and the associated Spirit Island Cruise was one of my favorites. You can't believe the colors with the backdrop of the mountains. Yes - there are a million internet pictures of it. Still worth it. Just taking pictures in the crisp air until you briefly stop at the Spirit Island is worth it."
"Beautiful spot, definitely hire a canoe from the boathouse and paddle around for an hour or two. Just so peaceful out on the water, you can get up close to some birds, very relaxing, great place."
we did the lake cruise which gave lovely views. adverts suggest you will see wildlife but we were told on board the boat that we would not see any wildlife.
"The cruise was not only informative but fun as well. We were blessed to catch a female moose on the shore as we cruised to spirit island. The entire surroundings are relaxing and very photogenic. Spirit Island was small, but great viewpoints along the short hike."
"My wife and I enjoyed tea at the Lake Maligne Chalet on September 1, 2014. When we first pulled up to the parking lot, we were surprised to find that there were no spots available since its a reasonably well-sized parking lot. Even though the weather was rather cold and rainy, hordes of tourists seem to surge back and forth through the area as charter buses bring in waves of boat passengers. On a day when the weather is poor, boating on Lake Maligne does not look appealing: The surrounding mountains are covered in mist and the winds can whip up whitecaps and chop. But, if the chalet is open, make a B-line to the chalet and order the afternoon tea. Let me save you some time and explain how to actually find the chalet or teahouse. First, its not at the Lake Maligne Canyon. There is a café on the other side of the Lake Maligne Canyon trailhead (somewhat covered by trees), but that café is cafeteria style and appears to be a great choice if the sun is out and you can get a spot on the outdoor patio overlooking the river. To find the Lake Maligne chalet, park in the Lake Maligne parking lot and walk towards the first set of buildings; the gift shop/café and the ticket office. Pass these buildings (above or below) and continue walking about 100 yards. Youll see a stick construction (think log cabin) structure on the top of the adjacent hill. Im not sure why there dont appear to be more signs or information about the chalet and the teaperhaps we simply didnt see it. Im assuming youll typically need reservations on a sunny summer day as its not a big building, but on a poor weather day on September 1, we walked in and almost had the chalet to ourselves. The structure is impressive in that the building itself appears to be original and every detail from the old metal door handle to the period-appropriate tablecloths will take you back to the 20s. When we sat down, the wood burning stove was generating enough heat to warm my wife and the view from the enclosed porch area was wonderful, even with foul weather concealing some of the better elements of the backdropexcellent memory making. Im certain that some die-hard tea lovers will find the offerings here somewhat meager, but to our less-refined palates, the selection of tea, savories and desserts all fit together well and the price of $34 per person made sense when considering the ambiance. Without the surrounding lake experience, it would be hard to compare this $68 tray of goodies to one of the more well-known tea houses in Victoria. By the time youve been in Jasper for a few days, you also realize $30 is what a few ice cream cones seem to cost, so you begin to roll with the price punches. In terms of the food and tea...Of the desserts, my favorite was the chocolate chip shortbread. The other lunch-related items were good. Overall, I highly recommend a trip to the Lake Maligne Chalet and might rank it right after a trip to Edit Cavelle; especially if youre lucky enough to be sitting across from someone you really enjoy. It will take you back in time to railroad tourists and women fishing for lake trout while wearing dresses and corsettes. Do your best to reserve a spot in the enclosed patio with a view of the lake if they allow you to do so. And, make sure you wander around a bit and take in the photos and other antiques."
"This was stunning, the lake is gorgeous. I then took the Moose Walk (you don't need to be dressed to trek, I did it in flip flops and with my handbag). I was lucky enough to see a moose through the trees, it then joined me at the lake and took a bathe"
"The ride is very expensive $64 for 1 1/2 h including a stop at Spirit Island.
Nice views. Spirit Island was made famous as a symbol of Jasper National Park by a famous photograph made in the 1960's."
"Maligne is at the end of a long, winding road in the mountains above Jasper, Alberta, but it's worth the drive. Not only is the trip scenic along the way, the payoff at the end is spectacular. The lake it self, is stunning and the surrounding mountains offer some of the best hiking ( by ""best"" I mean ""the most scenery accessed with the least effort"") anywhere in the park. Try the Bald Hills route, which leaves from the parking lot across the bridge from the lodge. It's a great half-day trek!"
A nice trip from Jasper to Maligne Lake. Some beautiful views. A good trip if you have the time. Worth the visit!
"The ride to the lake is scenic. You might see some wild elk, bears, deer, and other creatures. When you arrive at the lake there is a nice gift shop and restaurant. Try to get on the first boat out in the morning and the lake beauty is all for you. The sights are what you came to this park for. The mountains, glaciers, and trees are gorgeous and will be etched in you mind forever."
"You can have boat tour or Mary Schaffer Loop Trail 3.2 km. I recommended you to have a lunch at Maligne Lakes View Restaurant where you can eat while enjoy the view of the lake. If in summer, bbq sausages and hamburgs are sold at price about $12 with drinks. Check out my blog http://www.luyue.org/rocky-mountain-trip-vancouver-jasper-banff/ for more details."
"The drive out to Maligne Lake is worth the trip to Jasper. The mountains, lakes, and animal sitings made this an all day excursion."
"the road along Malign Canyon to Malign Lake is a must see in Jasper....awesome! To make the trip complete, I would recommend taking the boat cruise on the lake. Boat trip reservations can be made in Jasper or at Malign Lake visitor centre. The boat ride is about 90 minutes in total and takes you to the far end of the lake. The trip includes live narration of history, points of interest and spectacular scenery. Our captain was Kat and the first mate and narrator was Jenn. They were both new at this and were both great. The boat ride takes you to one of the gems of the Rocky Mountains ..., Spirit Island! Even more awesome when you see it in person. The boat dropped us off for 10 minutes on shore across from the Sprit Island. A must see when in the National Park."
"This is one of those places where it really does wow you upon arrival! There are boats to hire from the beginning and a variety of trails you can follow. We preferred to get off the beaten track a little (it does get very busy) and just sit on one of the small stretches of beach you can find in between the trees. Excellent views of the mountains beyond the lake. You could easily spend a good half day here. Can't comment on the food as we only bought a lolly and a couple of drinks but it did look very busy and quite depressing inside! Prices seemed ok, usual for these types of attractions. We also saw a moose roaming free - as they do tend to do!"
"It's true that you can't see the best of the lake unless you take the boat trip or hire a canoe but this means that the other end of the lake is quieter and has been kept unspoilt. The boat trips are timed to ensure that only one boatload is ever there at a time and no-one is allowed on Spirit Island. Personally I thought it was entirely worth the money, as the trip was enjoyable and the views spectacular - it was clear and sunny on the day we went. When we arrived at the main part of the lake, before taking the boat trip, a female moose was in the lake, feeding on the weed at the bottom, which is apparently quite a regular occurrence."
"Vacation on a budget, so no cruise for us, but worth it to visit, hike around a bit, have picnic lunch and enjoy the views."
"Maligne Lake is a beautiful lake whose beauty is enhanced by the boat cruise to Spirit Island. On a sunny day, the blue of the lake is offset by the surrounding snow capped mountains. Photo opportunities abound. You have one captain and one narrator on the boat ride. The narrator gives you a history of the area, geological information, and information about the flora and fauna around the lake. There is a stop of about 15-20 minutes at the pier near Spirit Island where you get out of the boat to stretch your legs and take photos. Restrooms (toilets) are available near the pier.A restaurant, gift shop, and restrooms are available at the main piers. There is also a multi-level deck for relaxing, eating, and enjoying the view.I found it a very relaxing experience. Maligne Lake is about 45 minutes from Jasper."
"Maligne Lake is one of Jasper's highlights.Regardless of the Spirit Island story and how one photo made the place world famous, Maligne Lake is gorgeous in its own right.The setting, with the snowy peaks, glaciers and waterfalls wherever you look, combined with the emerald-coloured water provide a real treat.If you have time, rent a canoe or kayak for a few hours and enjoy the quiet, the beautiful water and the great little beaches and lunch spots.If you have more than a day, camp for the night on one of the beaches......If you are less adventurous or if being that close to water is not your thing, take the boat cruise (There is only one....).It takes one and a half hours and stops once at the famous Spirit Island, letting you hike the circular trail for ten minutes (That is if you don't want to miss the boat back....!!).The guide on the boat was very informative and provided interesting facts and stories about the lake.The trip is not cheap (at all...) but we found that it was certainly worthwhile.Do It!! You'll Love It!!"
Maligne Lake is a gorgeous place to visit. There are so many pretty places in this area. You must stop here! The lake is beautiful. The boat ride out to Spirit Island is a great way to see the area from being on the lake. The small trail at Spirit Island is pretty and gives great view of the box canyon. Our college guide was delightful. The restaurant is nice-they even had an outside barbeque going on the day we were there. Such a pretty view from the deck of the restaurant. Don't miss stopping here.
The boat cruise to Spirit Island is a great way to spend a day. The boats can get very busy so go early or be prepared to wait - or book ahead. There is a gift shop with a place to eat - very ordinary but OK. They also have a Tea House which is pricy but excellent.The highlight is the boat ride and the informative guides who will tell you all about the area and it's history.
"Maligne Lake is in a very pretty setting and the boat ride to Spirit Island is worth it if somewhat pricey. We saw a moose running along the bank past crowds of people. If one want to canoe, this is a great place to spend a day."
"A stunning lake with other walks available. Went to Moose Lake and guess what? Mother and young Moose feeding in a smaller lake,"
"We visited Maligne Lake very late in the day (after hiking to Edith Cavell Meadows and visiting town). We enjoyed a peaceful picnic by the lake. Everything was closed (it would have been fun to rent a canoe or kayak), but I'm sure it's packed with tourists earlier in the day, and the peace and tranquility were wonderful. We were visited by a doe and saw Canadian geese settling in for the night. Beautiful reflections on the water. Saw a large bull elk on the drive back, and a group of bighorn sheep (ewes and lambs) beside the road, across from Medicine Lake."
"Far better than Lake Louise, even with the tourists, since the scenery has been left untouched by the buildings that were added. Quite spectacular view, with all the mountains in the background."
We went on the boat tour on Maligne Lake. Boats were a little small but hosts were informative and the view was worth it. This is such a tranquil spot.
"Don't miss renting a canoe for an hour, you won't regret it! They are easy to maneuver and even though there is a tour boat that goes down the middle of the lake the wake isn't enough to disturb your canoe (which I was worried about). Such a great perspective of the surroundings from the canoe."
"More or less discovered by early tourists and home to one of the oldest tourist lodges. Good info about this, beautiful views and nice walks. Like it very much."
Maligne Lake is further along the road from the Maligne canyon and whilst driving to Maligne Lake several cars in front stopped! Outside a black bear and her cub! I got the BEST pictures!! Wow it was fantastic! Made my day!!!!!!Before arriving at Maligne Lake there is another one called 'Sinking Lake' and like many others it's lovely. Stop soak up the atmosphere and have a look all around you - its BEAUTIFUL and not many people!!Coffee shop/Cafeteria has great HOT chocolate but FULL of people. Maligne Lake was lovely with huge mountains all round - very scenic!!BUT lots of people everywhere - had a walk along the shores so wonderful and away from ALL the tourists until it started to rain then we headed back to the car
"We visited Maligne Lake on our first day in Jasper. We had an early start which really paid off - on the beautiful drive to the lake we saw a moose and a bear, plus lots of mountain sheep and elk. We took the lake cruise out to Spirit Island - it was absolutely stunning, the colours are just amazing and have to be seen to be believed. Back on dry land we ate lunch along the lake path and walked the Mary Schaffer loop. On the way back to Jasper we stopped and walked down Maligne Canyon - again it was stunning. If you visit Jasper, Maligne Lake and Canyon are must-do's."
"We were so glad we took the boat trip out onto the Maligne Lake and had a wonderful time here. The young student who gave us the commentary was particularly informative and friendly, and even amazed us by jumping into the icy lake to cool off when we stopped to take photographs. If she was freezing, she didn't show it. That's dedication to the job for you! This was an unforgettable morning, with photo opportunities at every turn. The gift shop was particularly good and had a bigger range of non-trashy souvenirs than we had seen elsewhere. The cafe was ordinary but adequate, and quite reasonably priced for the status of the landmark. This spot is really worth a recommendation."
"There are many very interesting and beautiful places to drive to while in Jasper. The roads are sometimes narrow and they have many curves and up and down hills. One must drive carefully and slowly. Tourists are sometimes curious people. One sees a couple of cars stopped and immediately one thinks "" Oh wild life"" The most frightening drive was on the way to Maligne Lake. People jump out of their cars, set up expensive tripods and cameras. I asked one man what he was wanting to photograph  "" Oh a small bear just a few feet away."" To which I replied "" If there is a cub around then the Mother bear is close by. You men are all standing there, if the Mother bear appears you don't have a chanceThis is not Hollywood.This is the wild country. You have left your car windows down . A bear can put his paw into you car and hurt you.""  I was very upset by their ignorance and decided there was no point staying there as these tourists hadn't any idea about the danger they were in. all I can say is "" Stay in the car . If you leave the car stay close by. If a bear comes charging Never mind trying to save your tripod .but save yourself.""The sad thing is the bear attacks because she is protecting her young and then the Parks police may decide to shoot her because the bear is dangerous.Tourists should always read the manual given out at the Parks Canada gate.Enjoy your drive and the scenery but be careful!"
"We went here late in the afternoon and were able to rent a double sea kayak. There were not many people on the lake, so it was a very relaxing experience, and the people at the boathouse were very nice. The water was still and we got some great pictures reflecting the mountains."
About 50 min drive outside of Jasper - saw moose and deer on the drive up. Popular location. We booked online for first cruise and beat the crowds. Cruise was relaxing with nice views of the lake and box canyon at the end. Gift shop had some better items than we saw elsewhere. The restaurant was much more reasonably priced than most in Jasper. There are picnic tables near the boats and on the way back to Jasper if you want to pack a lunch.
"We enjoyed walking along the edge of the lake (we did the Mary Schafer loop but I think would just stick to the lakeside rather than veering away from the lake as the trail did), Lots of photo opportunities and on a very hot day, refreshing to dip your toes in the glacial water. We didn't do the Spirit Island cruise as it seemed too expensive for us, but we enjoyed a drink in the café. The facilities at the lake are excellent."
"We loved this trip to the lake. Saw lots of bears and cubs just grazing by the side of the road. The lake was not as stunning as our last visit 10 years ago a it was windy so you don't get the same reflection, however still a pretty place to visit. Bald eagles on the way and Medicine lake is stunning to pass. Best view of our trip.Food at the lodge was cheap and nice to so worth buying here.High bear activity so we were not keen to walk too far as warning everywhere. Thought we might have done the boat trip but a bit pricy"
Took the boat cruise to Spirit Lake. $60 but good value. Amazing views that you cannot see otherwise. The guest day lodge has excellent food and surprising good value.
One of the prettiest spots in the Jasper area. It is a bit of a drive to get there (about an hour) but there is plenty to see on the way including stopping at the Canyon (a must in my opinion). We left it till later in the day which limited our time at the lake so we didn't do the full walk which was a shame as it looked great. A moose swam from one side to our side attracting a crowd...the moose then stayed in the water on a sandbar grazing which was a sight to see. No bears sighted but we did see plenty of mountain sheep on the road going back.
We visited after being disappointed at lake louise. Tremendous views. Take the boat trip to spirit island. Photo ops great the whole time but when you get off boat at island you get the chance of copying an iconic picture. Guide on boat very helpful and knowledgable.
We wanted to do some walks in the neighbourhoud to go higher than the tree line but the walks were close because of bear activity. The lake is very big and the views are not that spectacular. Probably good if you really go out with a boat.
We visited Maligne lake as part of a day tour which included Maligne Canyon. The striking blue colour of the lake enclosed by mountains and pine trees stays long in the memory. We disembarked for 20 minutes at Spirit Island which is a highly picturesque part of the lake and provided some great photo opportunities. If you are looking for a relaxing day out in a fabulous romantic setting then this trip is for you.
This a lovely spot and well worth the drive from Jasper. We didn't do the lake cruise but there are many hiking trails. We did the Mary Schaeffer Loop and it was a nice hike and not too hard.
One of the prettiest spots in the Jasper area. It is a bit of a drive to get there but there is plenty to see on the way. The road there is one of the best chances to spot wildlife in the area including bears.
"A must see in the Canadian Rockies. My husband and grandson rented a canoe and thoroughly enjoyed themselves, while I sat on a bench in the sunshine, taking in the beauty of this tranquil lake. What I love about Maligne Lake is, that it is not overrun with tourists like Lake Louise, but is just as beautiful."
"One should really do some extensive hiking to enjoy this area. We only spent one day here, but it would be a great place to camp and explore. There are plenty of bears so bring your spray and bells. The boat trip to Spirit Island would probably be advisable as well. There are plenty of accomodations in Jasper if you are not campers. This place should be on everyone's bucket list."
"Lovely walk through the forest which leads back to the lake with the most stunning views when the weather is good! Also saw bear cups on the road from jasper, so drive slowly and keep looking!"
"We wanted to rent a canoe that day & try out our lifejacket for our little dog. But dan wasn't feeling good that day. We went for a walkabout, bought a book of Jasper's history in the gift shop. The lake was beautiful and it was a lovely day."
We saw a mama bear and 2 cubs on the drive to the lake. The boat tour is totally worth it to see the view on the far side of the lake.
"We did a guided fishing tour and enjoyed every minute of it! Thanks to our guide, Cortland? I think that was his name! He was very knowledgable about the lake, mountains, glaciers and most importantly, the fishing!Tips for fishing:- book for the first slot. It will get way to hot to do it later in the morning and afternoon.- pack snacks and water.- take a cooler with ice for your catches! Our guide cleaned the fish for us! - take SUNSCREEN! -And use it. Regardless of how much sun there is.Spirit island tour:It might seem expensive, but we enjoyed it! The paid tour has you on the island for 10 mins only. If you can canoe/kayak that far and back, go on your own and spend as much time as you want!- wear comfy shoes! Lots of trails!"
"We were surprised to know that you can only see Spirit Island by canoe or boat. Somewhere along the line we missed this piece of information. We were very disappointed although the morning was overcast anyway. The staff in the cafeteria was friendly, although we cannot say the same for the staff in the outwear store. We would recommend many other areas of Jasper before this one."
This part of Canada is all beautiful but Maligne Lake truly does take your breath away! I could have stayed and stared forever.
We really enjoyed the visit to this lake. The scenery is just beautiful. There are boat tours available or you can hire a canoe or take a hike. Some people were even swimming. There is a really large cafeteria area and a couple of gift shops. Really worth the 30 minute drive off the highway to visit. The drive there is limited to 60 km/ hr so you can keep an eye out for the wildlife. Unfortunately we didn't see any wildlife on our drive there and back.
I enjoyed my visit to Maligne Lake more than those to Lake Louise or Emerald Lake and the boat trip is a must to fully appreciate the size of the lake and the scenic views. The weather was glorious (unlike the rain at Lake Louise) and I saw no mosquitos at all. I really liked the big terraced area outside the cafe/gift shop which had plenty of seating for those wanting just to sit and gaze.Full marks from me.
"It was a buzz to see all the wildlife on the road from Maligne Canyon to Maligne Lake. What a scenic drive! We were blessed with perfect weather and had no trouble purchasing tickets from the ticket office at Maligne Lake waiting only 20 minutes for the next 1 ½ cruise to beautiful Spirit Island. It was nice to sit back, relax and enjoy the serenity of the views. The young lady commentator was interesting and informative. Some of my husbands best panoramic photographs of our Canadian adventure were taken from Spirit Island. We would highly recommend a full day trip consisting of the Maligne Canyon Walk, lunch at Maligne Lake and taking an afternoon cruise to Spirit Island."
The boat trip is essential to fully appreciate the beauty of this place. It is also helpful to be given some understanding of its geological beginnings.
"The Lake itself was beautiful and worth the 30 minute drive off the highway. There was a buffet restaurant at the Lake as well as restrooms, a gift shop, hiking trails, Lake Cruises and more.What I enjoyed more than the Lake was the drive to the a lake. I was in Jasper National Park for 6 days and made the trip down Maligne Lake Road twice a day for wildlife. Along the main road over 6 days, I saw 8 Bears, many Big Horn Sheep, a Bald Eagle, a Moose and many Deer and Elk. You just need to watch your speed (limit of 60km/hour or 36mph) so you can spot the wildlife along the road. The scenery is also amazing. This is a road you need to visit daily and time at the Lake is also very enjoyable."
We've been to this area three times and this was the first time to visit the lake area. It will be the first place we visit next time. Can't believe we missed this view and experience on previous trips. Peaceful. Serene. Would even consider a back country permit next time.
We stopped here with our tour. It is a real beauty spot. The lake and the mountains are breathtaking. There are boat tours available and canoe rentals. They have a wonderful visitor center with a great gift shop and cafeteria. There is also a very nice outdoor apparel store if you need extra clothing or gifts. Definitely worth a visit.
"If you've seen Louise, Moraine, Bow and Peyto lakes then I'm not sure the drive to Maligne lake is worth it. What made it for us was the wildlife we saw en route including a large black bear that strolled past the side of our car! The lake is nice and I believe the boat tour is good but it started to rain when we were there so cut the stay short."
Great spot for canoeing. We spent a lovely quiet morning hiring out a canoe and paddling to the other side of the lake. We were totally on our own and were able to immerse ourselves in the area before paddling back to a friendly welcome. Also great place to get engaged :)
"If this is a first trip to the parks AND you have plenty of time, by all means go to Maligne Lake. The lake is still very pretty and along the drive you may see wildlife, especially in the evening. There is also the mysterious ""self-draining"" lake along the way. Other than that, the drive is a little monotonous as you will be driving through ""tree jail"" most of the way. Come prepared for those mosquitoes and then take a walk along the easy, beautifully maintained and scenic trail that begins near the Maligne Lake Boathouse. For photographers, the boathouse, red canoes and lakeside path will afford you some stunning shots as long as you avoid mid-day and shoot your pictures early or late in the day."
"This is such a nice place, little boat shed and jetty there was still some ice around the shed and jetty and a little toward the back of the lake. Amazing photos. Really fell in love with this Lake."
"We saw a lot of wildlife on the way there, which was great. However, the long drive has few spots to overtake slower traffic so do relax and be patient.Upon arriving at the lake, we were very unimpressed. We had seen moraine lake, lake Louise and several others with more jaw dropping views. From the edge of the lake, there really wasn't much to see other than enormous swarms of insects. I was told that the boat tours take your further along the lake to some good photo points, but did not go because of the overcast conditions that day, and the astronomical prices. Photographers should check sun positioning at this latitude for the days of your visit and plan to visit without having to shoot into the sun."
It is a nice lake in Jasper NP. The lake was frozen in May and the boat cruise/tour did not operate. There are a good view places to take pictures. The restaurant and the gift shop are very good.
"Spent a day hiking around the lake, fantastic. Great workout on some of the trails. The lake is beautiful and the drive there outstanding."
It is a beautiful lake but if you want to go to spirit island you have to take the boat that tends to drain your wallet. Absolutely crazy what they charge for a boat ride !
Went here in May while it was still fully frozen and things were pretty quite but it was a nice trip with alot of wildlife around and some of the walking trails free from snow and able to be used.Heaps of nice photo opportunities and good public facilities make this a good day out.
"The view of Malign Lake is probably nowhere near as beautiful as it would be in the summer.My visit in the first days of May were nice but the views just couldn't live up to their potential with so much snow on the water.That said, go visit when it is melted and I am sure it will be fantastic."
Jasper verus of Lake Minnewanka. while it provides stunning views of the rockies. It's a bit out of the way as it a good 30 -45 min drive from Jasper to the Lake on a narrow road. Did this drive towards the end of the season and it wasn't busy but I couldn't imagine what it would be like in the middle of the summer. Very frustrating would be my guess. Still worth the look if you have time.
"The lake was frozen and therefore nothing really to see in winter. Summer though It is rumored to be beauty beyond compare.
The road leading in is very nice with chances to see a variety of animals."
"The lines of the mountains in the distance are crystal clear, the pine-trees dip down to the water, their skirts making the water ripple. The sky was blue in May, the water was transparent and green-blue. As I sat in a wooden deck chair on a pontoon, I knew I couldn't leave without taking this beauty with me!A peace of mind and calming of my soul.You deserve this experience, you owe it to your core self.sand Roessler"
"We drove from Jasper and took it slowly to absorb the ever-changing scenery. After the early stretches of forest and mountain streams, the road runs along a lake flanked by a truly spectacular range of jagged quartzite peaks in gigantic smooth, pale grey slabs reaching up to the sky on our left. The journey is worth it just for this alone. Eventually the country opens out a bit before reaching beautiful and serene Lake Maligne. There's a cafe in the resort there that is open to the public, and walks along the shore. A wild female moose was taking a munch of water plants not far away when we were there. There are also long trails if you want to hike, but most were closed (September) due to bears feeding of the berries in those areas. There are regular cruises down the lake but they looked crowded so instead we hired a kayak and spent 2-3 happy hours paddling along the lake shores, admiring the peaks, spotting birds and looking for wildlife among the trees. This is a special place."
"We were originally under the impression that we could hike around the lake - but were disappointed when we could not. However, the view is spectacular and made for amazing photos. It was an amazing sight to see and I am so glad we went there, made for some of the best photos we took during that trip. We did not do the boat cruise as we found it to be a little pricey and we were on a budget. If you are coming from Jasper, it is a bit of a drive. I believe it was over an hour away."
"This lake is gorgeous from the shore, especially the spirit island side, but it was very well worth it to do the tour boat and see it from the water. It's hard to believe that it is naturally that neon turquoise color. You get a terrific view of the mountains from the lake as well. This lake is in my list of top favorite places in the world - so far! And dare I say it, I liked Maligne lake even better than Lake Louise in Banff."
"Drove up here for the day from Jasper. I think we were practically the first RV to arrive, and we were certainly the last to leave!!! Great day. Didn't do the boat tour (not enough time) but did take a couple of open canoes out from the old historic boathouse and paddled ourselves down and across the lake. Also went walking through the forests to a couple of small secluded lakes.The lake really is as beautiful as it looks in photos - my PC desktop photo is one of the lake and boathouse I took myself and every time I see it it reminds of just how amazing this place was"
If you visit Maligne Lake you must take the cruise Spectacular scenery including hanging glaciers and a lot of interesting information. It goes about halfway down the Lake where you can get off and take pictures of the most famous spot in Jasper National Park! We had a beautiful sunny day and really enjoyed this cruise.
"Spirit Island is world known and the view is totally awesome.
Magical place to see the stunning scenery and experience."
"Boat Trip to Spirit Island is well worth it. Be aware that they have special photography trips. They weren't running them the day I was there. I took a ""regular"" trip and go great photos."
"We drove to Maligne Lake after viewing the canyon. Both stops are well worth it! If you go to the lake, you really should invest in the boat tour to Spirit Island. It is truly a magical place and is only accessible by boat...a once in a lifetime experience!"
"The weather wasn't on our side as we went for the boat trip to Spirit Island. The snow came down horizontal for most of the trip, but the two Ladies, who were in charge of the small boat (43 people) gave a funny and entertaining commentary, which, together with the stunning scenery, helped us along. Thankfully, by the time we reached the stop at Spirit Island, the sun came out a bit and it stopped snowing. Spirit Island is totally overhyped, I don't know what it's all about!! It's the whole scenery and the lake that is breathtakingly beautiful!!!! I really couldn't get enough of it. The restaurant on shore is alright, nothing special but okay for a snack."
"The boat trip to Spirit Island is hosted by knowledgeable and enthusiastic guides, but the view from the ex whale-watching boats is not great, as the bow rises at speed. Spirit Island is somewhat over-hyped, but the view is stunning.The restaurant on the shore is not bad for a snack meal, bearing in mind it has no competition."
"The sight of this lake was breathtaking but just the appetiser. The boat trip up the lake to Spirit Island was superb. Views of the lake, its changing colours in the changing light, the framing by mountains and wildlife give this lake a unique quality. Whilst not the same shimmering colour of Lake Peyto, all in our party felt that the area was very special. Please continue to conserve it."
"The canyon you drive through when heading for Maligne Lake is extremely scenic, with lots of view points. Nature is overwhelming, so make sure to stop now and then to look around.Medecine Lake is one of the first stops, a lake where water dissapears in an underground cave system. The water shows up further down in the valley (and apparently also in may other locations), to form Maligne Canyon, another great trail to follow.Passing by Medecine Lake, one continues to Maligne Lake itself. A beautiful lake in a narrow valley between high mountain peaks and glaciers. Best known is of course the cruis to Spirit Island (which we didn't take). However a great destination as the views at the end of the valley must be overwhelming as well. Surely a destination one shouldn't miss when being in Jasper."
We headed here for the boat tour to spirit island. Well worth the trip. You can canoe the lake if you choose. Apparently there is a very remote camp site you can get to by canoe only which sounded amazing. Very scenic drive here and was great to get out onto the lake. Well worth it.
Great lake with a good long walk around it- nice and flat for a change from all the mountain walks we did. there are lots of mozis even in the cold september weather.
"While staying in Jasper for three days we took a 'side trip' to Lake Maligne and then the cruise to Spirit Island - both were quite stunning.The drive from Jasper to the lake is really lovely and though we did not see any of the local wildlife, the scenery is varied and wild.The lake itself and the local walks are great, though for us the undoubted highlight of the day was the cruise to Spirit Island. It is not cheap (but then little is in this part of Canada) but is excellent value. The 2 hour narrated trip almost defies superlatives, such is the staggering beauty of the lake itself, the surrounding mountains and glaciers, as well a the 20 minute 'stop off' at the Island.""Iconic"" is an overused word, but there is no other way of describing the stunning views of (and from) the 'Island' itself and of the higher reaches of Maligne Lake. There is never more than one boat there at any one time, so while you don't have long there, there are not many companions! This was one of the highlights of our trip to the Canadian Rockies, greatly helped by the warm and sunny weather which allowed us to see everything there was to see."
"I knew Mary Schaffer at the turn of the century lobbied to have Maligne Lake included in the park, but until I arrived and saw it first hand did I understand why. IT IS BEAUTIFUL! If you move to the right of the boat docks, you can see a full view of the long lake to the mountains. To me it was breathtaking! All of the rockies are maganificant, but to me Maligne Lake was the highlight of our trip."
"Although the day began wet, it cleared up when we boarded the small boat for scenic Spirit Island. The Lithuanian guide gave a good & amusing commentary, explaining all the geographic features. Just before we reached the island a grizzly was spotted on the lake shore - never seen before by the guides. It made the day especially as a black bear had been clearly seen on the coach journey up to the lake.Spirit Island isn't really an island but a small isthmus jutting out into the lake, that can be easily reached in September and is a very peaceful place. There doesn't seem to be an answer as to how it got its name, but seems to go back to the First Nation people.There is the inevitable gift shop & good cafe (selling steaming bowls of soup, chilli & beef stew for a reasonable price, along with the more regular food & drink, & loos at the visitor centre."
"Very scenic drive up to Maligne lake and you can be lucky enough to see lots of wildlife. The last time we visited we saw bears, elk and caribou this time we saw some goats. Apparently it has been a good year for berries and that's where all the bears are. We've only seen 2 so far on our current trip, fingers crossed for some more sightings.Some good trails ranging from easy to more difficult.Beautiful lake with the picturesque spirit island."
"Over 50 km drive from Jasper. Plenty of free parking. Lovely views and lots of places to walk. We did not take a boat trip to Spirit Island, as the weather was closing in and the water was looking choppy. There is a shop, toilets and cafe. No entrance fee. Well worth the effort to get there."
"Great place to visit. I personally consider the boat ride to Spirit Island a must-do. Seeing Maligne Lake is free. Getting to Spirit Lake requires either a very long hike, a 6-8 hour canoe trip, or a 90-minute boat trip."
"Beautiful and peaceful. No motorboats allowed except the tour boats. We didn''t take the tour, but we heard it was amazing. The lake was nestled amongst the mountains and was postcard beautiful!!"
The color of the water is unbelievable. It was a fairly easy hike to the top to the Rocks to overlook the lake. Then we took a hike around the lake to the cascades where the water feeds into the lake
"Me and my fiance came here and rented a canoe for an hour. The equipment was great and the service great. I think it took less than five minutes to rent the canoe and be on the water. The lake has a beautiful mountainous turquoise color. The scenery around the lake is also fantastic. Be aware when you are canoeing of the waves that the tour boat makes. Realistically its not a big deal at all, but if you are new to canoeing it may scare you. The drive to the lake is also fantastic and well known for wildlife. We saw a cow moose with a calf. Worth the drive, definitely a must do if you go to Jasper."
"We just had a wonderful afternoon at Maligne Lake. It's a beautiful spot and if you are a photographer, has the location of the most famous scenic Canadian photograph at Spirit Island.You can hire a canoe or a boat or take the trip up to Spirit Island as we did.The road from Jasper to Maligne Lake is renowned for spotting wild life - we were surprised by the brief company of 3 deer."
"The boat tour is magnificent! At 60$/person it's good value. If you only take one boat tour, I would recommend renting an electric boat at pyramid lake instead. At 90$/hr you can seat up to 8 in their ""family cruiser"", and at 60$/hr you can seat 2 in their ""fun cruiser"". The most fun I had in Jasper :-P"
"It is a peaceful spot, surrounded by the Rocky mountains. The turquoise water is spectacular! The high light of the trip is when you arrive to Spirit Island (if you take the boat tour). It´s name comes from the idea that, if there would be a place where the Gods could meet for an annual conference, would be here! (According to what our tour guide, and I agree!). The only thing I didn´t like about the tour, was the little time allowed to spend in the island. I wish we could have stayed longer!But even if you don´t take the tour to Spirit Island, if you are in Jasper, spending the day in Maligne Lake is a must!"
Maligne Lake is one of the most beautiful areas of Jasper National Park. I took the boat tour along the lake to Spirit Island which I really enjoyed. The view of the mountains and glaciers is amazing. You can also canoe or kayak on the lake and its not too busy.
"A highlight of our stay in Jasper was a boat ride on Lake Maligne. Both our Captain and our tour guide were young women. The educational presentation was excellent. The lake and surrounding mountains were exquisite. I can't really comment on the value, because this was included in a package. Getting out on this beautiful lake is highly recommended."
This place is drop dead gorgeous. The ride there and back is also quite beautiful. Once there we took the cruise which I have mixed feelings about. Overpriced for what it is but you do get to see the whole lake which otherwise would take a lot of paddling. Did pick up some interesting tidbits of info re the mountains and glaciers. We ended up afterwards. taking two easy walks in the area-Mary Schaffer Loop and the Moose Lake Loop. In retrospect I'd recommend renting a canoe for 2-3 hours and paddling around. Less expensive than the cruise and you get to see some amazing vistas.
"Thanks to the Gypsy guide technology we rented for our trip, we found this stunning lake. The place was deserted in July as not many people know it exists, so we were able to take photos without other people in shot, soak up the tranquil views and have a great time. The restaurant on site provided good food and the walk around the lake has great views of this beautiful lake. Take out a kayak to really get a feel of the place."
"There is no doubt the lake and surrounding area is stunning. If you want to experience the real beauty of the place you have to get your boots on and hike some the trails. The only way to see spirit island is by boat so you can either book a cruise or bring or rent a kayak. Its a long paddle though! The cruise is good in that you get a guide telling you about the location, however, it is a bit rushed, very busy and expensive. If they halved the number of trips and doubled your time in the island, it would be better. A really beautiful place though."
"If you go to Jasper don t miss Maligne lake, so beatiful the blue and green water. great boats a lot of activities ."
"Two weeks of motor homing through Canada during July proved to be the most wonderful scenic camping I have ever experienced. The terrain is rugged. The best hikes were next to the rivers. I saw some rafting on the river but I didn't try it. The water was cool, clear and refreshing. So many beautiful birds to watch. Take a bird guide booklet to recognize them all.The fellow campers were honest, tidy and friendly (most were Canadian).Taking in all the natural beauty and the sunsets was very memorable. I want to go again!"
"My eldest daughter and I travelled to Jasper Park last week and had the opportunity to enjoy a fabulous photographic tour of Maligne Lake and Spirit Island . Ross our professional photographer and teacher ... was a joy to enjoy this special area with . His history and connection of the area given that he was born and raised in Jasper ... added so much to our tour . Thank you for helping us capture some amazing shots ! The crew ... Brittney , Greg and Andie were also entertaining and fun to share this special journey with ! Would highly recommend as a must do while at Maligne Lake ...Sabina Petermann"
"Wow, Got their about midday on a lovely warm clear day and it was stunning. Emerald green waters surrounded by towering mountains. We had a walk around ,learnt a bit of the history of the place then got on a cruise boat at 1pm. for a 90 minute tour out to the world famous picture spot called SPIRIT ISLAND. This lake is the largest one in the Jasper National Park, a beautifull lake to canoe on , a pristine wilderness. We got off for a short stroll near Spirit island to take photos and just admire the beauty of the place. There are three glaciers out there to see. Motor boats can only go as far as Spirit Island the rest is highly protected wilderness but you can go all the way by canoe 22 kilometres. The lake is frozen in winter and covered by up to 12 ft. of snow. When we got off the boat we had booked into the old Chalet for afternoon tea Canadian style. Truly a wonder of nature, one you should not miss, GO THERE ."
"Whenever I see the pictures of Maligne Lake, I always see the one with the island, Spirit Island. So when I got there, I was thinking, where is the island? When I went to the reception area for the lake cruise, the people at the desk told me that you need to go on their boat to see it, and also was informed it takes about $60 per adult. ""Triple shock"" when they told me all of the tours are booked for the day!! Well we were there on a nice summer weekend, so I guess we should have known better.So, we decided to walk around the area, have some coffee and enjoy! We saw deers around, and on our way here, we did see a bear near Maligne Canyon, so I thought it was worth coming down here. To see an island in a lake, you can go to Pyramid Lake as well.But to see the ""postcard view"" of it, I was told that you need to hike about on hour or so. But at least there you can hike on your own, but here you would have to go on the cruise!!"
"Been here a few times to walk around and rent a rowboat and get out on the water. It is stunning, the rowboat rental is quick and easy and about what you would expect to pay, and there is a decent cafeteria style place to grab some food and relax. A must see in my view if you go to Jasper. Only complain (and this applies to all of Jasper) is that it gets crowded in the summer with tour buses - annoying, but par for the course in the mountain parks this time of year."
Snow capped mountains in the background and caribous strolling on the paths. This was worth the stop.
"The best way to get away from the tourist crowd is take the several hiking options. Only few people will be there and you will get to see the small lake too.The lake was beautiful blue green in a sunny morning blue skies. There are few ducks and during the hike we didn't see any animals. A bit disappointing, guess the tourists scared them away.Down side - very touristic area."
"WOW.. I can't really remember what the lake looked like. BUT on the way there and back we saw BEARS along the roadside.We had our first bear traffic jam.. people stopping to watch amazing Black Bears walking on the roadside, walking on the road, wandering between parked cars as tourists stood open mouthed.During our visit to the canadian Rockies in the summer of 2013 we saw about a dozen black bears. The Jasper area was the best - they are just along the roadside in the grass eating fresh tips of newly shooting plants. Top Tips for spotting bears on roadside:(There are some very good guides about bear safety you should read before you go.)1- Go in the early evening, or very early morning when it's cooler, and fewer people are around2- Drive at a sensible speed, but keep your eyes out for bears in the grass by the roadside3- Look out for other drivers who have stopped by the roadside - have they spotted anything4- The bears just ignore cars, tho' they can sometimes be spooked and run off if you stop near them.5- More often they will just keep eating grass and plants and wander about into the road and ignore you.6 - Stay in your car. Do Not feed the bears."
"The drive to this lake is worth it before you even get to the lake. We saw deer, elk and a bear with her 3cubs. So that's what the traffic jam was! You also pass medicine lake on the way up. When you reach the lake it is refreshing to see. There is a cruise you can take or there are many identified and signed walks you can take. We chose the Opal loop walk which gives stunning views from the top, but be warned it is a long steep climb through woodland. It s hard work.. There is an easier short trail, Mary Schaeffer loop which is easier and still gives beautiful views. I am amazed that this is the height if the summer and yet it is really quiet. It's a worthwhile visit whilst staying in jasper."
"Having visited the Canyon we drove on down to the lake. Going down, there are some laybys for photo ops. We also saw a mother black bear and her cub foraging.The lake is very pretty, but you need a sunny day because it is good for picnics. there are kayaks for hire and boat rides to Spirit Island, which is only accessible this way. $59 per adult.No proper toilets, so make sure you have baby wipes for your hands."
Drove to the Lake even though not planning to take the boat cruise. Saw Caribou and Deer on the way up to the Lake. Awesome views even from the shoreline. Waded in the lake which was freezing. Tea room was a real surprise. Bbq had just closed for the day (awesome prices) Huge variety of food at outstandingly good prices. After some tearful dining experiences on this trip I was ecstatic to have a large afternoon tea for two with coffee for $15.00. Home baked taste to everything we tried. Even got to photograph a deer directly behind the tea rooms. Hope it is not guest of honour at tomorrow's BBQ.
"If you're in Jasper, you don't want to leave without having visited Maligne Lake. It was such a beautiful sight. If you can, you should try to be at the lake in the early hours of the morning when the water is perfectly still, the lake covered in mist and you have the whole place to yourself."
I lovely drive to the Lake with a brief stop at Medicine Lake on the way. I saw caribou and a grizzly. The views of the Lake are lovely and there is a short hike along it. Definitely need insect repellent. I enjoyed tea and scone from the café looking at the Lake. I had been on the Cruise a few years ago so didn't do it again but still enjoyed my time at the Lake.
"very beautiful part of our country. Friendly and knowledgeable captain and assistant.... who actually jumped into the near freezing water ""just for fun""... only saw one deer on the road although told it would take longer because of the abundant wildlife. There was one group of big horned sheep in a parking lot along the way (probably hoping from handouts from people). weather changes fast - rained before we got on the boat cruise - then again 20 minutes after the 90 minute cruise. Cafeteria closes at 7:00 so if you take the last cruise of the day - quickly go up to grab a bite - food was good - not cheap but never is at tourist attractions."
We lucked out with a very beautiful day weatherwise. This was one of my top three world wide scenic views. The others being a spring day in a mountain village in the Swiss Alps and the breathtaking scenery of Bora Bora. GO!!!!
"Well worth the drive from Jasper to this lake as the views are stunning and the water very clear but cold! The scenery along the drive makes the trip worthwhile and, if you are lucky, much wildlife to be seen - we saw a bald eagle, caribou, mountain goats, horned sheep, deer - unfortunately no bears. Once at the lake we decided to take a hike which was very enjoyable although there were many mozzies at the time we visited in mid June. We did not go on the lake cruise as we had done that last time we visited the lake but it is a good trip and would recommend for first time visitors. There is a reasonably priced restaurant and interesting visitor centre."
"We had tickets pre booked for the Lake Cruise but even if you don't want to do that the drive up to the Lake from Jasper is worth doing in its own right. The wildlife along the way was great.... brown bear and her baby plus mountain goats and there kids. The views just make it a really scenic drive and then you finally get to a beautiful lake at the end of it. The restaurant, gift shops and bathroom facilities on site were very good too."
"Much more beautiful than Lake Louise we thought! Beautiful, blue, clear water. It almost looks fake it's so unbelievably breathtaking!!"
"My husband & I have visited Maligne Lake on numerous occassions. We usually canoe part way down the Lake and have lunch. We have camped over night, and canoed to Spirit Island and to the very end of the Lake. We love the area so much that we took our own pictures of Spirit Island, had one picture made bigger, had it framed and it now hangs in our dinning room. What a beautiful spot."
"went on a boat cruise over the lake , very nice and the guides were great. Didn;t see any wildlife but it was a beautiful ride."
"We had to do this trip twice, as the first time it was very misty and you couldn't see the end of the lake. What a difference a day made. Sparkling blue and very beautiful the colour was something else very turquoise.There were lots of tours from all over the world, there was a good lodge selling souvenirs, with a very good café. Don't forget to take some mosquito repellent as they were all over the place."
My husband loves water and boats so we pre booked a boat trip and drove down.... Wonderful drive and we saw elk and mountain sheep although we didnt see any bears I gather it's a good toad through July to see them we were just unlucky! The boat trip was lovely but very pricey. I'd be inclined to consider going with jaspertourcompany.com as they were great and also offer guided trips to the lake which I'm sure would be amazing.....
"Take the boat cruise if you can, although it was kind of expensive (~$60). You get to see a lot more of the lake and the guide was wonderful. Have your camera ready, you won't stop clicking."
To see this lake and the beautiful scenery has completed a bucket list item for me. The water is incredible and the view inspiring. We took the boat tour (well worth the money) and went to Spirit Island. The tour guides were great!
A peaceful and beautiful lake with fewer visitors than Lake Louise and Lake Moraine which makes it very refreshing and enlightening
We saw 4 bears driving slowly up to Maligne Lake. We hiked around a little and ate some amazing stew overlooking the beautiful lake. We will take a boat tour next time we are out there for sure. Very peaceful and calm.
"It is a long winding drive to this lake, but the drive is very scenic and the lake is worth it. We saw a bear on the rode driving back from the lake, he walked on the road to cross over a river, awesome sighting.The lake is huge compared to may of the scenic lakes we saw, and the boat tour was great. Lots of great scenery, and towards the end of the lake you get the iconic views you see in pictures. It really is beautify and worth the trip. It was very cloudy when we got back there but still beautiful. You go for a short walk on the shore which is a nice bonus. The food at the info center is cafeteria style, but it does the job."
When staying in jasper a journey to the lake is a must. The scenery is spectacular and if you are very lucky you might just see some of the inhabitants. A snack at the cafe is excellent and the restrooms spotless. Don't miss it!!
"We got here too late to go canoeing, but we walked around, and then drove back into Jasper. We saw a mama black bear with THREE cubs, a couple other bears, a deer and a caribou. Made the trip worthwhile! If you're out this far, definitely stop at Maligne Canyon--very impressive falls and gorges!"
"We visited quite a few lakes on our trip (Lake Louise, Moraine Lake, Emerald Lake), and this is tied for favorite with Lake Louise. Unless the day is very dreary, the lake is spectacular. If you go, you MUST take the boat trip out to Spirit Island. It is definitely worth the money. The trip itself is beautiful. You learn a lot about the area and about the glaciers. And you get to see way more of the area than you typically would be able to do (no one else is allowed to take boats out, so this is your only chance!). A quick warning about Spirit Island: once you get off the boat, you only have a few minutes to get your pictures. So don't dilly dally!! Have your camera out and ready, and start snapping!"
This peaceful scene with the little boats will always remain with me. Would love to have had time to take a trip on the lake by boat but still so worth a visit.
"Everything is nice about the lake starting from the journey from Jasper. Our booking only the day earlier went perfect. Cheerful people drove the bus that was ready to please the tourist by doing something extra. Saw loads of wild animal on the road itself like bear, bear with calves, elk, bald eagle etc. the boat ride in changing water color to Spirit Island was superb. Seeing the actual island beat all the nice photo. . When the tour end and you are back in city you wonder if you really saw the lake or it was a movie which just ended and you are back again to the real world. When you are at the lake itself you get a surreal experience. It is the most watchable places of all the places I have ever seen."
"Great place and lovely boat ride on the lake, the team that took us on the boat was also great . Tour boat skipper and the guide both girls we're very knowledgable and fun loving. We were surprised that they were so young. We also went to miracle lake on the way and our tour guide wess who at one time was a park ranger had soo many things to share and show.Enjoyed every bit of it"
Unfortunately it was a really wet day when we visited but we still decided to go on the boat trip to Spirit Island as we probably would not go again. It was very nice if rather expensive and looked quite mysterious in the mist and cloud so definitely worth going.
"I strongly recommend you to take the boat tour to spirit island on SUNNY days. The boat tour offers breathtaking panoramic views, and you wont regre it! You'll experience endless mountains and glacier views. The water color of Maligne lake changes to more glacier green as the boat takes you further away from the dock."
"scenery was great, lots of wildlife along the way with pullouts to enjoy the view
Gift shop very pricey
Lots of parking"
We arrived at the lake in the morning with sun beaming over mountaintops. Ice was still on the lake; stunning beauty!
"We took in many spectacular sights in Jasper during a wintery April weekend. Many of the places I had seen before in summer were even more awesome in the winter snow and ice. However unfortunately this was not true of Maligne Lake. The place was completely deserted. The lake was frozen and all of the amazing color was hidden. If you were there for snowshoeing or cross country skiing, I'm sure you would love it here. For people like us, with children in tow, we would save this for the summer months."
"Maligne Lake is located in the Maligne Valley in Jasper National Park, Alberta. Maligne Lake is the second largest glacier-fed lake in the world, stretching 22km (14mi). Maligne Lake and its natural beauty with pristine blue water, breathtaking views and undisturbed wildlife attracts many visitors every year. This beautiful lake and surrounding area is also a great place for hiking with a variety of trails, there is a trail for everyone. Maligne Lake even has a 44km (27.5mi) trail, the Skyline Trail, which is by far the most popular. All of the trails have great views of the lake and surrounding area, so pick one that seems right for you. Personally I haven't done any of the trails at Maligne Lake yet, so I can't offer my opinion on which one is that best. You can rent canoes at Maligne Lake as well and there are guided fishing tours as well.One thing I can give my opinion on is the Maligne Lake cruise to Spirit Island...the most photographed spot in Jasper National Park. The Maligne Lake Cruise is a 90 minute boat cruise that will take you on the blue waters of the lake with amazing mountain views to Spirit Island. Here you get off the boat for about 15-20 minutes to walk to the Spirit Island viewpoint. The view is fantastic and if you go in the summer time, later afternoon is the best for photos as the sun is behind you. On the way the guide will tell you some things about the history of Maligne Lake with some interesting facts. The boat ride is fun and the views along the way are beautiful as well, but the best views are at Spirit Island of course. Quite pricey, but definitely worth the money in my opinion!"
"Few people seem to take the time to drive up to Maligne Lake during winter and they have no idea what they are missing out on. We spent 4 nights at Jasper Park Lodge over Christmas and 2 of the days we spent snowshoeing around Maligne Lake. The views were absolutely spectacular, the snowshoeing was good-very good and, most importantly, it was almost devoid of people. The few who do make the drive up there just seem to park, get out and take photos and leave. Do the lake some justice and at least do one of the two short loops and you'll be rewarded with even better views as well as the chance to see some wildlife. We didn't see much wildlife while snowshoeing, but there were plenty of fox, fisher and snowshoe hare tracks and a small family group of mountain sheep were busy feeding on the edge of Medicine Lake on the drive up and back. So, avoid the crowds in town and on the ski hill for one morning or afternoon and take the drive up to Maligne Lake if you can."
"There's nothing like the rockies! We stay in Jasper for two night, and the first evening there a herd of Elk came into town. The bull was bugling it was so cool, the next day we went for a drive up to maligne lake. On the way there we saw a bighorn sheep a wolf a moose and a grizzly. And maligne lake was amazing, with snow capped mountains and lots of wildlife. So many lakes though Canada and their all beautiful! We traveled down though the rockies down to baniff and stayed there for a few night, just beautiful. Will never get sick of going two Canada! This has been our second trip there and i will go again...."
"The lake is one of the best around Jasper National park and is bigger than others. There are some nice trails to practice hiking. We did ""The bald trail"", about 3 hours return. It was quite hard at the begin but when you get the top you can forget the bad moments. There were some attractions as boat rents and more."
"My friend and i did a month,s tour of the Rockies , Vancouver [and island] and a cruise to Alaska,and although we saw some fantastic sights for me the highlight of my tour had to be Maligne lake and the road to it. We did the lake cruise to Spirit island-I felt it was quite expensive, but glad I did it- the sky was cloudless and the day was perfect-{I now have the famous picture as my FB Timeline banner} When returning at night to see the sunset we saw a big Grizzly bear right by the side of the road. Needless to say we missed the sunset!! but did see the wonderful 'Alpenglow' on the mountains."
"We did the boat ride to Spirit Island. This was a lovely attraction with a view you will not soon forget, and an absolute paradise if you fancy yourself a photographer.Likes: price was reasonable. You can get a bit of a discount if you book through one of the adventure tour places in Jasper and bundle it with some other activities like rafting or the tramway. It was raining when we got there, and even though our tickets were for 3pm, we were told we could wait it out and take one of the later boats to see if it would stop raining. That is just what we did, and we ended up going at 5pm instead and had amazing weather and photos, so that was great. While we waited, we did the short hike along the lakeshore. It was an easy walk and provided a few photo opportunities of the mountain, lake and wildlife.The guide on the boat was friendly and informative and it made the boat ride very nice. The view of Spirit Island was simply breathtaking and worth every penny. Dislikes: 1. Biggest dislike was that the boat only stops for about 30 minutes to get the pictures of Spirit Island. Do yourself a favour and sit near the back of the boat so you can be the first one off, and book it to the viewing platform as quick as you can. 2. Other drivers on the road that were going way too fast. Slow down! This is a national park and if you run over all the wildlife there won't be any left! In my opinion Parks Canada should totally install photo radar along these drives and ticket the hell out of people with no respect.Keep in Mind: It was a bit of a drive ( I think about 2-3 hours) from Jasper. We were slowed down by stopping a few times to see wildlife on the sides of the road (some elk and bears). There are a few look off points to see along the way as well, so give yourself some time to take it slow and really enjoy all there is to see. There is a cafeteria/restaurant at Maligne Lake, although I found it pricey. So I would pack some snacks, especially since there isn't really anywhere to stop and grab a snack along the drive to/from Jasper.There is a canoe/kayak rental place so you can go explore out on the lak youself. I don't know the price of this as it was raining the day we went, although had it been nicer we totally would have done it. There are also some other, longer hikes you can do in the area, although again we were rained out of going on these."
The road in to the lake was great as there are opportunites to see wildlife (we saw a bear on the side of the road) but until you make it to the lake is when you really start to get excited.I took the boat that will take you across the lake with views of glaciers and massive mountains and more opportunities for wildlife spotting. Once you arrive to spirit island is where the pictures you see in postcards come to life the view is truly amazing and a scene you'll never forget.Don't miss this if you stop in jasper or are driving through you wont regret it.
The views of the lake were beautiful. It is worth the walk up the 100 steps to see it from the top. From each sure of of the top the views of the lake and mountains were fantastic. I even enjoyed the sign near the hiking trail warning about grizzly bears.
"Spent a full day in the maligne lake area. We started with a nice hike at maligne canyon then drove to maligne lake. This is an amazing road to,drive and your chances of witnessing wildlife in the normal,habitat is high. The scenery is also beautiful, backcountry you will not experience anywhere else. Plan for at least 5 hours if you want to take advantage of the the hiking trails and the road trip. In one day we saw grizzly bear, black bear, mountain goat and bighorn sheep. Better than the Calgary Zoo which is also a must if you are in the area."
Enjoyed the cruise around the lake. Even saw a moose on shore near the canoe boathouse. It is quite a drive to get there from downtown Jasper but the views are amazing.
The greenish water is beautiful against the mountains. Lots of great photo ops! The only downside are the not so pretty tour boats that are constantly in the water and therefore in your pictures!
We did a 7 hour Kayak. We made it to Spirit Island which was a disappointment compared to the much larger island in the narrows. If want to reach Spirit Island by Kayak be prepared physically for being in the boat for a long paddle....
Excellent hikle to Bald Hill with Georgious vies of the lake. Good hike but you have to take 600m. Take the short path upwards through the Wood and not the fire road.
"We decided to take the tour of Medicine Lake, Maligne Canyon and the Maligne lake boat ride to Spirit Island that is offered at the City Center in Jasper. It was great! Leslie was our tour guide and we enjoyed every minute. Captain Trevor and Captain Matt were our guides. Matt from Montreal gave an insightful talk about the lake, bears and trees. We had ten minutes to take photos at Spirit Lake. That is plenty of time. The boat was packed with tourists, but no one was crowded. Although it does not look it in photos, it's a large boat. On the tour we encountered a ""bear jam"" - tourists stopping on the road to watch a bear eat berries. Sounds silly, but how often do you see a bear outside a zoo? Leslie was patient and turned teh bus around so we could get a better view. Great tour."
"The boat ride on Maligne Lake was beautiful and peaceful, and Spirit Island was worth the whole trip."
The boat trip to see the Spirit Island was a very pleasant trip with a fabulous view of the island in the middle.
The entire Jasper National Park is breathtaking but this lake is something special. The 2nd largest glacier lake in the world is definitely worth the drive. Walk the loop.
"The drive to Maligne Lake ( and the canyon on the way) were enjoyable but this lake was not as impressive a view as Moraine Lake or Lake Louise, or even a smaller lake that I passed on the way to Moraine."
"Scenic Drive along Maligne Lake Road. It's too bad people feel the need to speed, creating dangerous driving conditions for other drivers and wildlife on the road - why not take your time and enjoy the scenery. Hiked a bit around the lake, sharing the trail with some deers! What an experience."
"Visiting Jasper? Come here. The drive alone is beautiful. The cruise to Spirit Lake was, as promised, and worth every penny. But it was the views from the trails that hooked us. If you can do it, hike the Bald Hills Fire Road to the top. My wife and I are avid walkers (mainly cities), and in decent shape for being in our late 50's. The Bald Hills Fire Road was a challenge! Up, and up and up, many twists and turns. The road is wide, though steep at places and washed out in others. But still very manageable. We took our time, and reached the top in 2.5 hours. The views at the top took our breaths away. There are good bathrooms at the trail head, but none along the trail or at the top. So, hiking down was faster of necessity. There was a grizzly dining at the end of the meadow at the top, and one that ran across the trail behind us on the way up. Recommend wearing bells and making noise so as not to startle the bears, and also to carry bear spray. There were a decent number of people on the trail and at the top, so never felt in danger. The visitors center at the lake has great rest rooms and an excellent cafeteria style food service. Wide variety of food and good quality. Sit by the windows inside, or on the expansive deck, and watch the sun and the clouds dance along the lake and mountains. It doesn't get an better than this."
"Very pretty views, and the drive up is scenic. Much quieter tourist attraction, I think because it is a bit of a drive from town. The lake was beautiful and some great hiking trails all around."
"Although we thought it was expensive at first ($120, day rental) it turned out we could hand the boats back after closing time by leaving them on the beach. This means you can probably get away with renting for just an hour or two, taking you past the rental hut closing time, and getting the rest of the afternoon for free. Just a tip! The lake is pretty and serene. Later on (6/7pm) there are very few people about. The food from the shop is IMO expensive so best to take some snacks with you. Toilets and large car park available.The drive down from Jasper is one of the best parts! Visited in September, Travelled as Young Couple."
We like the views of this lake much better than Lake Louise. We felt like this is a diamond in the rough that needs to be enjoyed! They have done a great job at preserving the area as they won't let the tour boats go to the furthest end of the lake and is only open to kayakers. Want to return to kayak and camp at remote site!
"The Maligne Lake Road is nice route, with beautiful scenery and possible wildlife viewings. The parking is not so easy at the Lake, so be patient and wait for somebody who leaves, we had to wait just 10-15 minutes.The Lake is huge, and beautiful. There are a lot of trails around the Lake, which are very nice. There is a boathouse on the Lake where you can rent canoes, kayaks and boats. The canoe was $30, the double kayak $45 for an hour, but double kayak was not available that time, so we rented a canoe. The canoe trip was very good on the lake, really recommend it. We could enjoy the scenery with less crowd and did a pleasant trip there."
"This review focuses more on the road from Jasper to Maligne Lake and back - the Maligne Lake Road. I review Maligne Lake in my Maligne Lake Cruise review.We spent six days in Jasper/Banff and we only saw four instances of wildlife. Up to the date where we drove to Maligne Lake, we were quite disappointed with our limited wildlife viewings. But these viewings on Maligne Lake Road in only a span of a few hours made everything worthwhile. We saw an elk right on the side of the road as well as two bighorn sheep near Medicine Lake. The bighorn sheep didn't seem afraid of humans at all. The drive itself is quite nice, not just because of its great views, but also because of the low speed limit that allows you to enjoy the drive. Obviously, the lake itself is well worth the time (see my Maligne Lake cruise review)."
We once again took the boat cruise around the lake and to Spirit Island. The guides on the boat are very interesting and full of information. It is always good to see Spirit Island and take pictures of a view that has been painted and photographed so often. The lake itself is beautiful and the walk along the shore is very nice and easy.
"This was a fantastic outing from Jasper. The drive is part of the experience with the beautiful Maligne Canyon stop and the animals along the way. We only saw mountain sheep but we are assured that there is normally lots of other wildlife along the way! The lake itself is lovely with beautiful walks, kayaking and a nice lodge. We didn't take one of the cruises and still found lots to enjoy. A must on a visit to Jasper."
"The drive to Maligne Lake from Jasper was gorgeous - enough so we did it two days in a row. We seen elk, coyote and mountain goats along the way. There are many places to pull off the road for photographs or a picnic, with ample bathroom facilities. Everytime the road turned, there was a new mountain view and Malige Lake was crystal blue and just a piece of heaven on earth. We hope we are lucky enough to go back again someday."
Worth a day out. the lake offers fabulous views - especially so when the sun is out and the sky is clear. This is a trip worth doing from Jasper as you can take in the superb views offered by Medicine lake which is on the way there. Great day out and well worth the time
Enjoyed the cruise and adequate facility's for the location. Cruise goes to Spirit Island at the end of the lake and the tour guide was very helpful explaining everything
We enjoyed this beautiful lake. They have a restaurant with outdoor seating that overlooks the lake. You can bring your own lunch or they have a bbq outside that was great. I did not eat food from the inside. The views are spectacular and the drive to Maligne Lake is great with lots of wildlife on this road. On our way back we stopped at Maligne Canyon and hiked all the way to bottom and around (beyond the crowds) and found a few views that were stunning and very rewarding! We decided to skip the cruise to Spirit Island and enjoy all the post card shots from the professionals. Hard choice but no regrets and we saved a boat load of money! LOL. I think the cruise is more for families and elders. Hubby and I are in our 40's and are hikers not cruisers. Don't miss this lake- it was a highlight of my trip!
"We had Nikkita as our guide, he was great fun with a good sense of humour and we had a laugh with him. The trip was quite interesting but the highlight was the viewpoint at spirit island and the £250k toilet tat actually flushed yaaaaay"
"Wow!Four of us went to the have Afternoon High Tea at the Brewster Chalet at Maligne Lake this past week and I promise you it does not disappoint!From a wide variety of perfectly brewed teas, accompanied with fresh strawberries and cream, raisin scones and clotted cream, dainty finger sandwiches and sumptuous desserts, along with an incredible view of the picturesque Maligne Lake. This is a must do on your travel itinerary!"
"A picture postcard lake that is not far from Jasper. Hiking, fishing, boating--all are available. We saw much wildlife in the area."
"This was a gorgeous lake with cool fog that accumulated in the morning. You can take a boat out on it, although we opted to hike the ""difficult"" rated Opal Hills Trail, two parking lots up from the Lake. Very pretty!"
"went for a nice leisurely stroll around the lake. but would dispute its statusas best lake in rockies. Loraine and Louise are far superior settings, but if you a fisherman or power boat person, then maligne is where you will need to be."
We took the first boat ride out on a Saturday morning and it was spectacular. The scenery is breathtaking. When we returned to the dock the parking lot area was full and people were everywhere. Go early and avoid the wait.
"Malign lake was our first outing in Jasper N.P. what an introduction, although the weather was poor and we were on motorcycles we ventured up, plenty of stops for photo's, on one stop my wife went down some steps to take pictures, when I tried to take her photo from the top of the steps I noticed something off to the right, a black bear with 2 cubs were eating, we sat and watched for a while, it was our first bear sighting and boy was it magical. We eventually got to the lake having seen lots of different wildlife. Lunch at the visitor centre, good value for money, before returning the same way via lots of wildlife stops.Great day out."
"This lake is known as Lake Luise's little sister. The view is just as beautiful and we went early in the morning the avoid the crowds that are sure to come. We rented a canoe (originality we planned to go at Lake Luise, but here you can put 4 in one canoe unlike Luise). The views are splendid and I heard that if you stay at the hotel, there is unlimited canoeing. :D We stopped by the hotel for future reference, but the rooms are tiny, only fit for 2 adults at a price of $625. We were informed that for a family of four we would have to buy 2 rooms. Now two rooms of 625 per night is a way too much. I guess for 625 you would want unlimited canoeing. Still, our time at the lake was beautiful and I recommend going by even for just a picture."
Beautiful colour - almost looks like it has had nucleur waste put in it as it seems to glow a turquoise blue.
Nice hiking here - many trails to choose from - lovely lake. Boat cruise too on Maligne Lake - but we didn't take it. Stop at Medicine Lake on the way. Lots of wildlife along the way if you go early....
"Maligne Lake is definitely worth a visit. and have lunch on the patio of the restaurant, the view is simply beautiful.
I also went for a hike around the lake. Worth a visit for sure. Almost as nice as Lake Louise."
"This place is beautiful. We booked a 90 minute lake cruise and its well worth every cent! Well organised, safe and staff pleasant and knowledgable. Dont visit Canada without visiting here, it simply took my breath away"
"We found ample parking and clean bathrooms. The trip out to Spirit Island was pretty. The boat landed toward the opposite end of the lake and we got out. We took terrific photos before returning. On the way back we saw two bald eagles working the area. With the boat you don't have to do any walking. Great views, no work, no complaints."
"We loved the lake and had a good walk round the short Mary Schaffer route but beware of mosquitos, spray well.Plenty of birds and views.The Centre has the usual gift shop but we were surprised by the quality and reasonable prices in the restaurant, good food and tasty.Against this we did not do boat trip as the $55 each for a boat trip and short visit to Spirit Island did not seem to be worth it and some other reviews agree with this.A friend of ours also undertook trip and thought it good but overpriced.You cannot see Spirit Island from the Maligne resort end of lake"
"We went to Maligne Lake because we were told that was the only place to rent kayaks and I am an avid sea kayaker.The sea kayak was comfortable and in good condition.The staff at the boathouse was excellent and in good cheer, even though they were tramping through a foot of water, since the boathouse was flooded."
"Stunning landscape, this Lake is a must in Jasper. But I was disappointed with the tour offered, a 90 minutes boat ride with just a 10 minutes visit to Spirit Island."
One of the most amazing sites that nature can provide to you. A great place to take a picnic lunch. Don't forget to wear good hiking shoes...you will see more! So peaceful.
"The restaurant and gift shop have a good offering of items. The boat ride to Spirit Point was relaxing and the crew were very nice. You board the boat and then travel to Spirit Point, you walk around for a photo op for about 10 to 15 minutes then it's back to the boat for the ride back. There's not much to see in early June, but they say in the summer the lake has a lot of boats on it."
The lake is breathtaking. Pricey but worth the cruise to see and hear the history during the tour.
"Pretty lake, good hiking there. Bit of a tourist trap in the boat ride across the lake."
"Like most of the tourist attractions in The Rockies, the cruise operators are cashing in. Fair enough, given their relatively short season. At more than $50 pp for a 1.5 hr cruise, it seemed high. However we had an entertaining guide which made it worthwhile. Try to go on a clear day and you'll get the best the lake offers. Spirit Island is visited on the cruise and will give you some great photos for the album."
The Maligne Lake is the largest body of water in the are. There is a lot of wild life along the way and the drive is beautiful with flowing water almost all along the way.
"The Cruise was a lovely way to spend on a hot afternoon, too bad it was too short but don't skip it. We will be going back next year, lovely place to spend the day. Try Canoeing or kayaking, the rates are reasonable."
"It is a 45 minute drive along a road marked for seeing wildlife. We had been looking out for wildlife ever since we came to the Rockies and had seen nothing but a couple of deer and some squirrels. Deer are common in NZ so not worth stopping for. On the way back from the lake we saw two bears grazing and were safely able to photograph them from the car for about 20 minutes. It was fabulous and our son was so thrilled. Anyway the lake is a picture paradise and the food at the cafe outstanding. It is very fresh, everything was lovely and there is a wonderful choice. Well worth the drive out and I highly recommend it to anyone who appreciates nature at its best"
"So quiet, beautiful and worth the drive.
A photographers paradise, trails to follow along the edge of the lake."
A quick stop in a Maligne Canyon (time on the return drive for the full deal) we arrived at the lake in time for a coffee before the boat cruise. This was most enjoyable. What was so amazing was that Spirit Island really was an island - so much melt and heavy summer rains meant the lake was very full. Sad for the people who thought the weather would be a deciding factor on whether to take the cruise. Just do it.
"Maligne Lake and Valley must be one of the most scenic places on this earth. It is absolutely outstanding. The turquoise lake waters, the snow topped mountains, the deep green forests all merge into a spectacular visual experience. We took a cruise up the lake and loved all of it. Our boat had people from many countries, and they all exclaimed that the site was beyond their expectations. I highly recommend this destination."
"The lake is like many others in the area a beautiful site. Canoes and boats trips are available and there are some short and longer trails. If you're an active hiker, I recommend Balds Hills (listed separately on tripadvisor). A lot of the visitors clearly come here for the boat trips on the lake and this leaves the trails quiet for us hikers."
Another beautiful lake in this area. Each one stands out in it own way
"Lovely lake, we went on a pretty wet day with low cloud base but still worth the trip. The boat trip is good, load of photo opps and info. The shop is good and think the cafe is better than most."
"On the way to maligne lake we say 6 bears, various sheep and a male elk. Also coming across medicine lake which provided a stunning view (better than maligne lake offers). Renting a canoe at maligne lake cost 30 CAD for an hour and 40 for the whole day. It's possible to buy tickets for organized boat trips, to take a walk along the lake and to use the clean bathroom facilities in the restaurant.The route is very touristic with many RV's."
"We had a great ride down Maligne Road to see the lake. This is where we saw most of the wildlife during our trip. Elk, black bear with babies, and mule deer. The lake was very nice with amentities. It was rainy during our drive but were surprised that there wasn't a single boat out on the lake. Overall a nice drive even in the rain."
Very pleasant drive to the lake and nice walk round the perimeter. Well worth a trip from Jasper.
I saw a different view of Maligne Lake - all frozen. I have enjoyed the cruise on Maligne lake earlier but this beauty with such thick snow all around and lake with frozen ice was a treat to the eyes too.
"I've been to Maligne Lake before, and have written about the cruise to Spirit Island, which is wonderful. I went again this year, but this time, I went to see the historic buildings, including Maligne Lake Chalet and accompanying Cabins, which are designated as National Historical Buildings. Ok, I'm into history, and architecture, so the log buildings, with their wrap-around deck and panoramic views (what I think is called Rustic Tudor) and the fact that they were built in 1927, grabbed my interest right away. I took my lunch and ate on the sunny patio between the Chalet and the Cabin, and it was so peaceful. I felt like I'd stepped back to a time when the only way to get to Maligne Lake was by horse. They have a life-sized display of the historic figures associated with the lake, which is informative - one of them is Curly Phillips, who built the boathouse, and ran the first boat tours, back in 1928. While I was there, a couple was coming to look at the facilities for their wedding, so I got to talk to one of the staff, and see inside. I learned that the restoration of the buildings was done by a local crew of dedicated carpenters and stone-masons, who studied up on historic tecniques so as to get the restoration right. As far as I can tell, they've done it faithfully to the ""Rustic"" architectural style, but in such a way that the buildings can be used for receptions and special events. If you are into history, its worth a visit. The Maligne Lake Chalet is a short walk up the path heading west from the Day Lodge (where the cafe and sundeck are). Apparently, they'll be serving ""Afternoon Tea"" starting in July. I'm sorry I missed that, but I enjoyed experiencing this little slice of Western Canadian history."
"A lovely lake, once you leave the man-made boating area behind. Surrounded by mountains, its peaceful and impressive.
The season's facilities were just setting up when we got there - a cafe, toilets, boating, etc."
Breathtaking views and majestic peaks. Just another beautiful spot in the Canadian Rockies!
"Nice drive to a beautiful lake. In May, there was still ice on the lake but the crowds were small and the views were still awesome. We saw rainbow trout spawning at the outlet of the lake. Saw mountain sheep right by the road on the way up."
"Maligne lake is around 1hr away from the Jasper town. In Google maps, they aren't calculating the distance directly. (You can drag the destination to the Maligne lake-So you can find the way). You can drive yourself to the lake. Take the Yellowhead Highway E (Signs for Edmonton). Take left at Maligne Road and on Maligne Road, take first right. Continue onto Township Road 453A, Range Road 260.. You will reach at Maligne lake. You can find the boat service to Spirit island there. The ticket charge is $55 per person(I think excluding tax, dont remember). First we went to the ticket center at Jasper town for the Spirit island tour but they asked us to get it from the lake center. The Spirit island is one of the most photographed location in Canadian Rockies. It is so scenic and as we reach at the middle of the lake, the color of the water changes to blue. That is spectacular. Still we felt the ticket is overpriced.This boat service is the only way to reach at Spirit island. We hardly get 20-25min over there to walk around and take photos. But not enough for a relaxed sight seeing. Actually they are stopping not at Spirit island but another place so near to it where we get a beautiful scenery of Spirit island. After coming back, when I was checking the photos I felt we could have gone to Spirit island as well. But in that hurry, we didn't see and couldn't ask them if there is a way.. Looking at the photos I felt we could have. So anyone who is planning for this trip, please ask the guide whether it is possible."
The lake is stunning beautiful blue and the wildlife is everywhere.
Amazing to just stand and look at the scenery in and around the lake. Make sure you wrap up well as it can be cold due to the glaciers and altitude. Well worth the visit.
A must see and take the boat as the really spectacular site is at the end of the lake.
"We took a boat ride to Spirit Island. Wonderful photo opportunity to take a post-card photo. It's cool on the water, even in August, so wear a wind-proof shell."
Malign Lake had a nice lakeside walk and and pretty views but not as beautiful as some lakes we visited in the Canadian Rockies. Unfortunately we had limited time here so we couldn't take the boat trip.
"Worth the trip! The lake can be choppy at times and you need to pack all you will need along the way. That includes fire wood. the scenery is majestic. If you can, go during the week, you will have a better chance at a last minute reservation"
"We were in Jasper during second week of August and everyone advised us that Maligne Lake was a must see place.However we were a little disappointed with this lake as we have already seen some of the best lakes in Canadian Rockies. After seeing Moraine Lake, Lake Louise and Emerald Lake etc etc, this one was a bit disappointing. The long drive from Jasper to Maligne Lake was excellent. We saw many wild animals either side of the road. The Medicine Lake was also very nice.A lot of people take the boat trip on Maligne Lake which we didnt take. It was a bit pricey to say the least. Instead we went for a lovely walk to Moose Lake loop nearby which was really excellent. We even encountered a baby Moose with its mother very close to us. If you are planning to visit the area then I would advise you to take protection against mosquito which drove us nuts."
"Just driving out to the lake is well worth the time as you have a good chance of seeing lots of wildlife. the views of the lake are stunning from the visitor center but the main attraction is the boat trip to spirit island. I suggest taking one of the later trips when their are less people about and the sun is behind you, this also gives you more chance of seeing bears on the drive back to Jasper.Keep your eyes on the shore line during the boat trip and you could well see a Moose or two."
One of the best lakes in the Rockies. Great lakeside walk. Excellent drive with great features to see on the way there. Worth the drive. Just wish the lake cruises were still operating!
"We drove to Maligne Lake on a cloudy, rainy day to take a short walk and have a cup of tea. Wildlife was incredible and the lake was very tranquil."
"We visited Maligne Lake as part of a Caravan bus tour of the Canadian Rockies. I won't play favorites rating the beauty of the national parks here. I find them all wonderful. I can only say that I am very glad we visited this lake. There's an old boat house and canoes to rent and a restaurant with terraced outdoor tables. But the natural beauty--the lake, the snow still on the mountains, the boathouse's one little incursion of humanity into the natural landscape--I wouldn't have wanted to miss it."
"My favourite scenery in the world, not just the rockies. Everyone raves about Spirit Island but it is the mountains behind nick named the valley of the gods which are stunning.
This was my second visit and as awe inspiring as the first time."
"We spent a good couple of hours here and we did not do any walks.We sat mesmerised by the lake as the weather was so glorious. there is a good shop here and good toilets etc. the cafe was probably the best attraction cafe we encountered during our three weeks in canada. it is very cheap indeed and such a huge variety of food, everyone would find something they liked here. The coffee has free refills although this is not advertised. The boat trips looked good but they were very very expensive indeed and no discounts even for large groups so we opted not to do the trip. I think it was about 58 cad each person. We both feel this was our favourite lake in the Rockies area ao do try to drive there and you will not be disappointed."
"The second largest glacier fed lake in the world, Maligne Lake is a beautiful destination for flatwater kayaking. It has limited camping (4 night / 6 people per group max) which keeps the lake from being over crowded. You do have to share the first half of the lake with the tour boats to Spirit Island but after that you enter, what the locals call ""the Corridor of the Gods"" - 10,000 foot + mountains raise from either side of the lake, glaciers, waterfalls... it just doesn't get any better. Although we usually sea kayak, this trip is well worth it."
"It's a nice scenic lake but frankly i find it to be overrated especially in comparison to the, in my view, far more scenic canyon. I suppose if you want to dole out the $60 a person for a boat cruise and haven't seen a lake surrounded by mountains it's worth it but as a side trip, I don't think it's worth the 40 mins drive from Jasper."
"The lake is ""just"" another clear cold Canadian lake. we did not take the boat trip. you pass by Medicine Lake on the way too.The trip to Maligne Lake, however, was well worth it; In addition to awesome scenery along the way, we saw black bear, including a mother and 3 cubs. although we did not see any, I am told that this area is where there is a good chance to see moose too."
"Acting as a tour guide from Edmonton, I was showing the highlights of Jasper National Park to a visitor from Manila, Philippines. On Sunday, July 24/11 we had the first boat at 10am booked. The weather was calm and the skies were starting to clear from weeks of rain. Our tour guide on the boat said it was probably the best conditions all summer that day. We had a fun boat ride with the guide giving lots of facts on the lake and of couse safety features of the boat. We had 44 people on board and were full. The boat driver is very cautious for canoes out on the water, since the 4c temperature if you get dunked is very dangerous. They rent canoes also at the lodge. The photo visit at the Spirit Island dock was approx. 10 minutes. Just enought time to soak it all in and take as many pictures as you want. They have state of the art washrooms there so no problem if the need arises. Back at the lodge we had a tour of the upcoming banquet and wedding facilities on the hill beside the dock/lake. The old Brewster cabins are being loving restored to their grandeur with an extra building constructed holding the washrooms and mechanical rooms. The interlocking brick patio and walkways will be superb for an outdoor party and the main Brewster cabin has a great room if weather does not permit outside. I understand they already have 4 weddings booked this year, wherein the bridal party gets all the buildings for the whole day along with cooks and servers. What a great location and I also think it would be a great place for a company retreat or planning session.We had breakfast at the cafeteria in the main lodge and were more than satisfied with the continental memo. While you cannot order bacon and eggs, they have loads of fresh baking with scones, muffins, fruit, yogurts, cereals, granola, juices and the best coffee I have tasted in years. I should have asked for the brand since it was delicious. Almost missed our 10am departure since we were having so much good times with breakfast. There are two shops that offer souvenirs, nick nacks and very good clothing. Lunch and suppers are expanded with a greater menu and barbeque items.In my previous visits, I have hiked along the west shore line which is well laid out with lots of photo op's, as well as benches. A great way to hike and have a picnic. I also understand the fishing for rainbows and eastern brook trout is second to none in the Park and one of these days I'm going to give it a try. All in all, this is a great place to visit and I strongly recommend this attraction. The drive up and back is most enjoyable with superb vistas and usually wildlife to see. I will post just some of my pictures from this visit. A picture is worth a thousand words. We will be back. Thank you!!"
"We walked along the shoreline, which left the bus tour folks back at the cafeteria, gift shop, and boat tour area. It was a pretty lake with mountain views, and afterward we did have a snack at the large cafeteria. Saw a herd of elk near the intersection of the main highway and road down to Maligne Canyon and Maligne Lake. What a beautiful drive."
"We drove for 45 minutes to get to Maligne lake and I must say that the drive was the best experience since we saw a lot of wildlife - bears, mountain goats and deer.The lake is very nicely located but it is a lake nothing more...sorry to say.In stead try Lake Peyto (a bit further) OR try Wells Gray National park and skip Jasper :-)"
"Yes, Maligne Lake is everything other people say - absolutely lovely, and I'm sure, if you can get on it, and have the time, the lake cruise is worth it, but for me, the drive there was pretty special too. As we came to Medicine Lake as well as the view of the lake, further on, there were a couple of cars stopped, we joined them to look at a young black bear, happily eating, near the shore. On the way back we stopped at Maligne Canyon and were amazed by the water falls.. The trip is a must do. Maligne Canyon Teahouse serves the best made-for-you sandwiches and their gift shop is very keenly priced, with nice stuff, not just tourist tat."
"We took the boat tour on Maligne Lake in October. It was the last week before they closed up for the season. The air was crisp and clear, and we were pleased to have the protection of the closed-in boat. It could have been chilly with the breeze across the water if we hadn't had that protection. We were expecting larger watercraft, but our tour guide explained that the boat and engine size is mandated by Parks Canada, who license the tour company. Apparently bigger boats would create too much wave action that could affect the shoreline of the lake. Smaller boats would be too slow, and the tour is already 90 mins long. (Canadians have a lot of rules to protect the environment). From the boat we saw some amazing vistas. The mountains rise up, shear faces and sharp peaks agains the sky. We think we saw some mountain sheep on one cliff face. The colour of the water, especially near Spirit Island, was as aquamarine as anything we've seen in Greece. They have very impressive lavatories. Apparently they are ecologically designed to have zero impact on the enviroment. They are solar powered and turn the sewage into water clear enough for irrigation. Our tour guide was a recent university graduate, who majored in geography. He said he'd worked at the lake each summer for three years, and clearly liked his job. He was very keen to tell us about the human geography of the lake. Apparently the first non-Native person to visit the lake was a woman adventurer and cartographer named Mary Scheffer, way back in the early 1900s. She was given a map to find the lake by a native boy named Samson Beaver. To say thanks, she named one of the mountains after him. We had a lot of fun on the boat tour, and then we tramped along the ""Mary Scheffer Loup"", an easy track that goes about a km along the east side of the lake (Having heard of her, we felt like we should at least walk along her track). Overall, it was a worthwhile visit. The only downside was that the Sheffer Loup doesn't go all along the side of the lake."
"Beautiful area, very nice road between the two lakes (This is where we saw Grizzly !!!)
And the 5 bridge walk is great (Especially if someone can wait at the bottom...)"
"I went to Maligne Lake on September 2nd but don't think it is worth the drive. If you decided to go you should definitely stop at Maligne Canyon and Medicine Lake as they were far more interesting. Maligne Lake was the least interesting lake I saw during my time in Jasper and Banff. I think the views at Pyramid Lake, which is far less of a drive than Maligne Lake, was far more impressive. The only thing that made the trip to Maligne Lake worth while is the fact I saw a grizzly bear about 2 km down the road after I left the lake."
"The trip up in the Maligne Lake Tour Shuttle is fantastic -- goes by trail heads and some pretty historic and definitely scenic spots. And then you arrive at the lake.It's amazing, seeing something with your own eyes which is so familiar. I mean Spirit Island. You'll know it when you see it, but the photos don't do it justice because they rarely show the amazing setting, the mountains that ring the lake. We took a boat tour and I'd recommend that because the staff are really knowledgable. I learned a lot about the local geology and ecosystem, but also about the history of the area. Apparently Maligne Lake was a place most of the early Jasperites (as they call themselves) loved. I was amazed to hear about the Norwegians and Metis who lived in Jasper in the early years. A part of Canadian history I never learned in school. There is a restaurant there and the food was really really nice -- not your usual fried carbos! I'd like to go back again, rent a kayak and paddle myself around and look for moose."
"The ride along Maligne Lake Road from Jasper was beautiful. We were lucky enough to spot a hunting coyote and a caribou before arriving at the lake. It is not as spectacular as are, for example, Bow Lake and Moraine Lake, but it is a pretty place. We skipped the boat tour (done too many of those) for a quiet loop walk along the lake and through a woods after which we enjoyed bowls of vegetarian chili at the visitor center."
"hubby and i went to see maligne lake in august and i have to say that the scenery was spectular (as expected). we didn't do the spirit island boat cruise but did relax just walking around the area, taking photo's and spotting wildlife, we did a hike off the path around the lake to another smaller lake, i think it was called Moose lake. we spotted deer on the way back. the drive to Maligne lake was also very beautiful, passing Medicine lake, the water was quite low and we found the story of the lake interesting. we had a top day, loved it"
"I am reviewing the way the tours are conducted which I give an average rating. The mountain and lake scenery of course is five star. Me and my husband decided to try the lake cruise as I wanted to see the beautiful Spirit Island that I have seen in alot of pictures as one of the most beautiful spots in Canada. The tour cost $43.00 Canadian for 90 minutes. I was not real impressed with the type of boat they do the tours in. I was hoping for a type of boat that you could stand out in the open with lots of open viewing areas for photography. The type of boat they conduct the tour in is a small boat that seats probably 40 or so and you are seated the whole time in the boat with windows to look out to the side. No view to the front as the bow of the boat lifts up as its moving and you have an overhead roof. You have to open a window if you are lucky enough to sit by the window or you will have reflection on your photos. The tour guide allows only 8 people at a time to go to the back of the boat's small viewing platform which was very bouncy and hard to keep your camera still and keep your feet steady so you won't fall out the back of the boat as the railing is rather low. The competition of all the people wanting to go out on the small platform and take pictures was heavy. When you reach Spirit Island you are only allowed 10 minutes to walk around and take pictures on a small loop trail that is near the island, you are not allowed to actually walk on Spirit Island but view it from the loop trail. Really that's fine, I can understand that but I would have liked more time to walk around the trail and take in the gorgeous natural settings, I felt rushed. There are restrooms at the stop for those that need them. The information given on the tour as you are riding out to the Spirit Island is informative about the geology and wildlife of the area. But overall I was dissappointed in the type of boat they use and the time constraints given for a hefty $43.00 price tag. With this spectacular natural setting I would have liked more time at the Spirit Island stop and a larger boat with outdoor viewing areas to accommodate 40 or more people wanting to take photos. I won't advise people to take or not take this tour but here is the experience I had and people can make up their own mind if they feel the tour is worth the price or not."
"It is an amazing place. Take the narrated tour of the lake to the Spirit Island. It really takes you back in time. Imagine the glacier, moving through the rocks, forming the rugged mountain peaks. You can see the bits of the glacier, still gigantic, remaining between the peaks, having been there for millions of years and slowly melting and forming this wonderous lake. It is 95% glacier fed lake. The water is the most BEAUTIFUL turquoise. If you stop at Lake Louise, you are missing out. Drive up to Jasper and visit Maligne Lake."
